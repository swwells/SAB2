Nebuchadnezzar built a statue of gold sixty
cubits high and six cubits wide. Taking a cubit to be 46 cm and assuming the
depth to also be six cubits, this would give a total volume of about 120 cubic meters (depending on the shape of the statue) -- which is about half as much gold as is in 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bullion_Depository">the United States Bullion Depository</a> in Fort Knox, Kentucky. 

<p><i>"Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore
    cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits"</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (3:2-7) Nebuchadnezzar invited all the officials in his kingdom to come to the dedication of the gold statue. Whoever 
refuses to worship the statue will be thrown into a fiery furnace. So they all came and worshiped the golden image.

<img src="../images/abs1.gif" > (3:24-27) Daniel's three friends were cast into a fiery furnace, but were totally unaffected -- not even a hair was 
singed. And they were joined by the Son of God (Jesus?), himself! At least that's who Nebuchadnezzar 
thought it looked like.

<p>(3:24) <i>"Nebuchadnezzar ... was astonished, and ... said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the 
midst of the fire?"</i>

    changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them."</i>

    decrees that anyone who says anything against the Hebrew god "shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a
dunghill."
    
    <p>(3:28) <i>"Then Nebuchadnezzar ... said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel</i> [angel? I thought it was Jesus!]
    <i> ... that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God."</i>
