<p><li><i>"But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt 
surely die."</i><br>
God says that if Adam eats from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, then 
the day that he does so, he will die. But later Adam eats the forbidden 
fruit (<a href="3.html#6">3:6</a>) and yet lives for another
930 years (<a href="5.html#5">5:5</a>). <a href="2.html#17">2:17</a>

<p><li>As a punishment for killing Abel, God says Cain will be "a fugitive and a vagabond." Yet
in just a few verses (<a href="4.html#16">4:16-17</a>) Cain will settle down, marry, have a son, and build a city. This is
not the activity one would expect from a fugitive and a vagabond. <a href="4.html#12">4:12</a>

<p><li>God promises Abram and his descendants all of the land of Canaan. But both
  history and the bible (<a href="../acts/7.html#5">Acts 7:5</a> and <a href="../heb/11.html#13">Hebrews 11:13</a>)
  show that God's promise to Abram was not fulfilled. 
<a href="13.html#15">13:15</a>, <a href="15.html#18">15:18</a>, 
<a href="17.html#8">17:8</a>, <a href="28.html#13">28:13-14</a>

<p><li>How long was the Egyptian captivity? This verse says 400 years, 
but <a href="../ex/12.html#40">Exodus 12:40</a> and
<a href="../gal/3.html#17">Galatians 3:17</a> say 430 years. <a href="15.html#13">15:13</a>

<p><li>"In the fourth generation they [Abraham's descendants] shall come hither again." 
But, if we count Abraham, then their return occurred after seven generations: 
Abraham, Isaac (<a href="21.html#1">Gen 21:1-3</a>), Jacob 
(<a href="25.html#19">Gen.25:19-26</a>), Levi (<a href="35.html#22">Gen 35:22-23</a>), 
Kohath (<a href="../ex/6.html#16">Ex 6:16</a>), Amramn
(<a href="../ex/6.html#18">Ex 6:18</a>), and Moses 
(<a href="../ex/6.html#20">Ex 6:20</a>). <a href="15.html#16">15:16</a>

<p><li>God promises to make Isaac's descendents as numerous as &quot;the stars of heaven&quot;, 
which, of course, never happened. The Jews have always been, and will always be, 
a small minority. <a href="22.html#17">22:17-18</a>, <a href="26.html#4">26:4</a>

<p><li>God renames Jacob twice (<a href="32.html#28">32:28</a>, <a href="35.html#10">35:10</a>
). God says that Jacob will henceforth be called Israel, but the Bible continues to call 
him Jacob anyway (<a href="47.html#28">47:28-29</a>). And even God himself calls him Jacob 
in <a href="46.html#2">46:2</a>. <a href="32.html#28">32:28</a>, <a href="35.html#10">35:10</a>

<p><li>God calls Jacob Jacob, though he said in <A
href="32.html#28">Gen.32:28</A> and <A href="35.html#10">35:10</A> that he
would no longer be called Jacob but Israel. <a href="46.html#2">46:2</a>

<p><li>God promises to bring Jacob safely back from
Egypt, but Jacob dies in Egypt (<A href="47.html#28">Gen.47:28-29</A>) <a href="46.html#3">46:3</a>

<p><li>The tribe of Judah will reign "until Shiloh," but Israel's first king (Saul) was from the tribe
of Benjamin (<a href="../acts/13.html#21">Acts 13:21</a>), and most of the time after this prophecy there was no king at all. 
<a href="49.html#10">49:10</a>

<p><li>"He washed his garments in wine ... His eyes shall be red with wine."<br>
    Did Judah really wash his clothes in wine? Were his eyes bloodshot from drinking too much? Or is this a prophecy of Jesus? 
    (I didn't know Jesus had a drinking problem.) <a href="49.html#11">49:11-12</a>
    
<p><li>Contrary to the prophecy in <a href="48.html#21">48:21</a>, Joseph died in Egypt, not Israel. 
<a href="50.html#24" >Gen.50:24</a>
