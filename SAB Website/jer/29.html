  Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou
    hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem, and
    to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that
    ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man that is mad,
    and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in
    the stocks.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
