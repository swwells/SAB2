<p><li>Jesus tells a man who had just lost his father: "Let the dead bury the dead."  <a href="8.html#21">8:21</a>

<p><li>Families will be torn apart because of Jesus (this is one of the few "prophecies" in the Bible that has actually come
true). "Brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents,
and cause them to be put to death."  <a href="10.html#21">10:21</a>

<p><li>Jesus says that he has come to destroy families by making family members hate each other. He has "come not to
send peace, but a sword."  <a href="10.html#34">10:34-36</a>

<p><li>Jesus warns us not to love our parents or children too much. We have to make sure that we always love him (who we
don't even know existed) more than our family.  <a href="10.html#37">10:37</a>

<p><li>When Jesus' mother and brothers want to see him, Jesus rudely asks, "Who is my mother? Who are my
brothers?"  So much for Jesus' family values.  <a href="12.html#47">12:47-49</a>

<p><li>Jesus is criticized by the Pharisees for not
washing his hands before eating. He defends himself by attacking them for not
killing disobedient children according to the commandment: &quot;He that curseth
father or mother, let him die the death.&quot; (See <A href="../ex/21.html#15">Ex 21:15</A>,
<A href="../lev/20.html#9">Lev 20:9</A>, <A href="../dt/21.html#18">Dt 21:18-21</A>) 
So, does Jesus think that children who curse their parents should be killed? It 
sure sounds like it. <a href="15.html#4">15:4-7</a>

<p><li>In the parable of the unforgiving servant, the king threatens to enslave a man and his entire family to pay for a debt. 
This practice, which was common at the time, seems not to have bothered Jesus very much.
The parable ends with this: "So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you." If you are cruel to others, 
God will be cruel to you. <a href="18.html#23">18:23-35</a>

<p><li>"It is not good to marry."<br>
After Jesus denounces divorce, his disciples say that if divorce isn't allowed, then &quot;it is good not to 
marry.&quot; Jesus agrees by saying that it is better to make yourself a eunuch
&quot;for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him
receive it.&quot;  <a href="19.html#10">19:10</a>
 
<p><li>Abandon your wife and children for Jesus and he'll give you a big reward.  <a href="19.html#29">19:29</a>

<p><li>There are no marriages in heaven. (Married people either don't go to heaven or they get divorced 
after arriving there. Marriages aren't made in heaven; they die there.) <a href="22.html#23">22:23-30</a>

<p><li>Jesus tells us to &quot;call no man your
father upon the earth.&quot; Not even dear old dad? How can we &quot;honor our father&quot; if we 
refuse to call him our father? <a href="23.html#9">23:9</a>

<p><li>"Woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days." Why? Does God especially hate
pregnant and nursing women?  <a href="24.html#19">24:19</a>

<p><li>The kingdom of heaven like ten virgins who went to meet their bridegroom. Five had oil for their lamps and five didn't. 
When the bridegroom was ready for them, only the five well-oiled virgins got to have sex with him on their wedding night. 
The bridegroom shunned the other five, saying "Get lost. I don't even know you." The moral to the story is this: watch out, 
you never know when (or with whom) Jesus will come.<a href="25.html#1">25:1-13</a>
