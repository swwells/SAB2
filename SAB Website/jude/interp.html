<p><li>"Jude, the ... brother of James"<br>
The author claims to be "Jude, the brother or James," which means he is also claiming to be the brother of Jesus, 
since that was the most famous James among believers at the time (Gal 1:19). He was lying, of course. <a href="1.html#1">1</a>

<p><li>Enoch, "the seventh from Adam", prophesied that God would come
with 10,000 of his saints &quot;to execute judgment upon all.&quot; But this

the Bible.  <a href="1.html#14">14-15</a>

<p><li>"Remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles."<br>
Jude was written in post-apostolic times, so it's author could not have been the apostle Jude (<a href="../lk/6.html#16">Luke 6:16</a>; 
<a href="../acts/1.html#13">Acts 1:13</a>; cf <a href="../jn/14.html#22">John 14:22</a>) as believers sometimes claim.
