<p><li>Peter claims that <a href="../dt/18.html#18">Dt 18:18-19</a> 
refers to Jesus, saying that those who refuse to follow him (all non-Christians) must be killed. 
 <a href="3.html#23">3:23</a>
 
<p><li>Peter and God scare Ananias and his wife to death for not forking over all of the money that they made when
selling their land. <a href="5.html#1">5:1-10</a>

<p><li>Peter has a dream in which God show him "wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls." The voice
(God's?) says, "Rise, Peter: kill and eat." <a href="10.html#10">10:10-13</a>

<p><li>Peter describes the vision that he had in the last chapter (<a href="10.html#10">10:10-13</a>). All 
kinds of beasts, creeping things, and fowls drop down from the sky in a big sheet, and a voice (God's, 
Satan's?) tells him to "Arise, Peter; slay and eat."  <a href="11.html#5">11:5-10</a>

<p><li>The "angel of the Lord" killed Herod by having him "eaten of worms" because "he gave not God the glory."
 <a href="12.html#23">12:23</a>
 
<p><li>David was "a man after [God's] own heart." <a href="13.html#22">13:22</a>
 
<p><li>The author of Acts talks about the "sure mercies of David." But David was anything but merciful. For 
 an example of his behavior see <a href="../2sam/12.html#31">2 Sam 12:31</a> and 
 <a href="../1chr/20.html#3">1 Chr 20:3</a>, where he saws, hacks, and burns to death the inhabitants of 
 several cities. <a href="13.html#34">13:34</a>
 
 <p><li>Paul and the Holy Ghost conspire together to make Elymas (the sorcerer) blind. <a href="13.html#8">13:8-11</a>
