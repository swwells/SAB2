<i>"And when he was come into his house, he took a knife,
and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her
bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel."</i> -- Judges 19:29

<h2 align="center">JUDGES</h2>

<p>Judges is a violent book even by biblical standards. It begins by chopping off the thumbs and big toes of a
captured king and ends by chopping up a dead concubine's body and sending the pieces in the mail parcel post. Along 
the way it describes, with apparent relish and approval, a gruesome "message from God" (a knife blade stuck deeply into 
a fat man's belly); a tent stake driven through a sleeping man's skull; a couple of severed heads delivered to Gideon; the 
killing of 69 brothers upon a single stone; a daughter killed by her father as a sacrifice to God; 300 foxes tied 
together by their tails and lit on fire; 1000 men killed with a jawbone of an ass; and, in what is probably the most disgusting 
story in all literature, the death and mutilation of the Levite's concubine. And I've left a lot out. Read it yourself, 
if you have a strong enough stomach, that is. And be sure to check out:

  Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel
    asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first,
    to fight against them? 2 And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold,
    I have delivered the land into his hand. 3 And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that
    we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into
    thy lot. So Simeon went with him. 4 And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their 
    hand:    and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men. 5 And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against 
    him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites. 6 But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, 
    and cut off his thumbs and his great toes. 7 And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut 
   off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me.
    And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.

    all that stood by him went out from him. 20 And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he
    had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat. 21 And Ehud put 
    forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly: 22 And the haft also went in 
    after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt 
    came out. 23  Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour
    upon him, and locked them.

Ehud delivers a "message from God" to the king of Moab. God's message consists of a knife thrust so deeply into the king's belly that it could not be 
extracted, "and the dirt came out." </font>

    the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet  in his summer chamber. 25 And they tarried 
    till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened them: 
    and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

    escaped unto Seirath. 27 And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the
    mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the
    mount, and he before them. 28  And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the
    Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man 
    to pass over. 29 And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and
    there escaped not a man. 30 So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had
    rest fourscore years. <td bgcolor="eeeeee" valign="top">
