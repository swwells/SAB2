<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>23:1</b>   Now Alma, having been warned of the Lord that the armies of king Noah would come upon them, and having 
made it known to his people, therefore they gathered together their flocks, and took of their grain, and departed into 
the wilderness before the armies of king Noah. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>23:2</b>   And the Lord did strengthen them, that the people of king Noah could not overtake them to destroy 
them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>23:3</b>   And they fled eight days' journey into the wilderness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>23:4</b>   And they came to a land, yea, even a very beautiful and pleasant land, a land of pure water. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>23:5</b>   And they pitched their tents, and began to till the ground, and began to build buildings; yea, they 
were industrious, and did labor <span class="a">exceedingly</span>. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>23:6</b>   And the people were desirous that Alma should be their king, for he was beloved by his people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>23:7</b>   But he said unto them: Behold, it is not expedient that we should have a king; for thus saith the Lord: 
Ye shall not esteem one flesh above another, or one man shall not think himself above another; therefore I say unto 
you it is not expedient that ye should have a king. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>23:8</b>   Nevertheless, if it were possible that ye could always have just men to be your kings it would be 
well for you to have a king. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>23:9</b>   But remember the iniquity of king Noah and his priests; and I myself was caught in a snare, and 
did many things which were abominable in the sight of the Lord, which caused me sore repentance; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>23:10</b>   Nevertheless, after much tribulation, the Lord did hear my cries, and did answer my prayers, and has 
made me an instrument in his hands in bringing so many of you to a knowledge of his truth. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>23:11</b>   Nevertheless, in this I do not glory, for I am unworthy to glory of myself. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>23:12</b>   And now I say unto you, ye have been oppressed by king Noah, and have been in bondage to him and his 
priests, and have been brought into iniquity by them; therefore ye were bound with the bands of iniquity. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>23:13</b>   And now as ye have been delivered by the power of God out of these bonds; yea, even out of the hands 
of king Noah and his people, and also from the bonds of iniquity, even so I desire that ye should <span class="plag">stand fast in this 
liberty wherewith ye have been made free</span>, and that ye trust no man to be a king over you. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

his ways and keeping his commandments. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>23:15</b>   Thus did Alma teach his people, that <span class="g">every man should love his

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>23:25</b>   For <span class="a">behold, it came to pass</span> that while they were in the land of Helam, yea, in the city of 
Helam, while tilling the land round about, behold an army of the Lamanites was in the borders of the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>23:26</b>   <span class="a">Now it came to pass</span> that the brethren of Alma fled from their fields, and gathered themselves 
together in the city of Helam; and they were much frightened because of the appearance of the Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>23:27</b>   But Alma went forth and stood among them, and exhorted them that they should not be frightened, 
but that they should remember the Lord their God and he would deliver them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>23:28</b>   Therefore they hushed their fears, and began to cry unto the Lord that he would soften the hearts of 
the Lamanites, that they would spare them, and their wives, and their children. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>23:29</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> the the Lord did soften the hearts of the Lamanites.  
And Alma and his brethren went forth and delivered themselves up into their hands; and the Lamanites took possession

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>23:30</b>   Now the armies of the Lamanites, which had followed after the people of king Limhi, had been lost 
in the wilderness for many days. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>23:31</b>   And behold, they had found those priests of king Noah, in a place which they called Amulon;

should not destroy their husbands. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

 in search of the land of Nephi when they discovered the land of Helam, which was possessed by Alma and his brethren. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="36"></a>23:36</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Lamanites promised unto Alma and his brethren, 
 that if they would show them the way which led to the land of Nephi that they would grant unto them their lives and 
 their liberty. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="37"></a>23:37</b>   But after Alma had shown them the way that led to the land of Nephi the Lamanites would not keep 
 their promise; but they set guards round about the land of Helam, over Alma and his brethren. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="38"></a>23:38</b>   And the remainder of them went to the land of Nephi; and a part of them returned to the land of Helam, 
 and also brought with them the wives and the children of the guards who had been left in the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="39"></a>23:39</b>   And the king of the Lamanites had granted unto Amulon that he should be a king and a ruler over his
