<p><li>"That which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned."<br>
Apostates will burn in hell with the other non-believers. <a href="6.html#8">6:8</a>

<p><li>"Melchisedec ... to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all."
Abraham gave Melchisedec one-tenth of all of the booty from "the slaughter of the kings," 
setting a fine example for religious hucksters everywhere. <a href="7.html#1">7:1-2</a>

<p><li>God will not forgive anyone unless something is killed for him in a bloody manner. <a href="9.html#13">9:13-22</a>

    shall devour the adversaries."<br> God will soon destroy non-believers in a fiery hell. <a href="10.html#27">10:27</a>

<p><li>Those who disobeyed the Old Testament law were killed without mercy. It will be much worse for those who displease

<p><li>The Israelites kept the passover and sprinkled blood on doorposts so that God wouldn't kill their firstborn children (like he did the Egyptians 
in <a href="../ex/12.html#29">Exodus 12:29</a>).
 <a href="11.html#28">11:28</a>
 
<p><li>God saved Rahab because she believed. (He killed all the non-believers in Jericho.) <a href="11.html#31">11:31</a>

<p><li>"Time would fail me to tell of Gideon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthah; of David also, and Samuel,
