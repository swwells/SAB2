The house that "Solomon built for
the Lord" was tiny compared to the one he built for himself. According to <A

of Solomon's.

  And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length

  <tr><td><B><A name="4">6:4</A></B>
  And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.
  
  <tr><td><B><A name="5">6:5</A></B>
  And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against
    the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle:
    and he made chambers round about:<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="6">6:6</A></B>
  The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six
    cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall
    of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not
    be fastened in the walls of the house.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="7">6:7</A></B>
  And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready

    any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="8">6:8</A></B>
  The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and

  So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams

  And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my

  And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my

  So Solomon built the house, and finished it.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the

  And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty

    it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="21">6:21</A></B>

  And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other

  The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other

  And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth

    wings touched one another in the midst of the house.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And the floors of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of

  In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in
