<p><li>God gives detailed instructions for performing ritualistic animal sacrifices. such bloody rituals
must be important to God, judging from the number of times that he repeats their instructions.
Indeed the entire first nine chapters of Leviticus can be summarized as follows: Get an animal,
kill it, sprinkle the blood around, cut the dead animal into pieces, and burn it for a "sweet savor
unto the Lord."  <a href="1.html#1">Chapters 1 - 9</a>

<p><li>Moses tells Aaron that his sons were burned to death to sanctify and glorify God. <a href="10.html#3">10:3</a>

<p><li> Moses tells Aaron's cousins to drag the burned bodies out of the camp, and he warns Aaron not to mourn the death of his sons or God will 
    kill him too, along with everyone else. <a href="10.html#4">10:4-6</a>

<p><li>"Whosoever ... giveth ... his seed unto Molech ... the people ... shall stone him with stones."  <a href="20.html#2">20:2</a>

<p><li>If you refuse to kill someone who gives his seed to Molech, God set his face against you and your family. 
<a href="20.html#4">20:4-5</a>

<p><li>"For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death." Couldn't

God wants us to kill lots of animals for him. Not just any animals, though. God only wants dead, male animals without any blemishes. Don't 
kill any blind , broken, maimed, or scabbed, or female animials for him. <a href="22.html#19">22:19-24</a>

<p><li>God gives us more instructions on killing and burning animals. I guess the first nine

-- it is "a sweet savour unto the Lord."  <a href="23.html#12">23:12-14, 18</a>

<p><li>Don't do any work on the day of atonement or God will destroy you.
 <a href="23.html#29">23:29-30</a>
 
 <p><li>A man curses and blasphemes while disputing with another man. Moses asks God what to 
do about it. God says that the whole community must stone him to death. "And the children of Israel did as the Lord
