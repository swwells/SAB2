<img src="../../images/sci1.gif"> (11:4-15) The angel Raphael tells Tobias Jr. to take along the gall of a fish. When he got home, Junior rubbed the 
rotten fish gall in his dad's eyes for a half hour or so. Then a white skin peeled off of his eyes, "like the skin of an egg." As soon as
 Tobias Sr. peeled the egg skin off of his eyeballs, he could see just fine.

<p>(11:4) <i>"Raphael said to Tobias: Take with thee of the gall of the fish, 
for it will be necessary."</i>

<tr><td><B><A name="">11:3</a></b> If it please thee therefore, let us go before, and let the family follow softly after us, together with thy wife,
 and with the beasts.
 
 <tr><td><B><A name="">11:4</a></b> And as this their going pleased him, 
	<span class="a">Raphael said to Tobias: Take with thee of the gall of the fish, 
for it will be necessary.</span> So Tobias took some of that gall and departed.

<tr><td><B><A name="">11:5</a></b> But Anna sat beside the way daily, on the top of a hill, from whence she might see afar off.<td bgcolor="eeeeee"> 

<tr><td><B><A name="">11:6</a></b> And while she watched his coming from that place, she saw him afar off, and presently perceived it was her 
son coming: and returning she told her husband, saying: Behold thy son cometh.<td bgcolor="eeeeee"> 

<tr><td><B><A name="">11:7</a></b> And Raphael said to Tobias: As soon as thou shalt come into thy house, forthwith adore the Lord thy God: 
and giving thanks to him, go to thy father, and kiss him.<td bgcolor="eeeeee"> 

<tr><td><B><A name="">11:8</a></b> And immediately<span class="a"> anoint his eyes with this gall of the fish, which thou carriest with thee. 
For be assured that his eyes shall be presently opened, and thy father shall see</span> the light of heaven, and shall rejoice 
in the sight of thee.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

(11:8)  <i>"Anoint his eyes with this gall of the fish, which thou carriest with thee.

shewed his joy by his fawning and wagging his tail.<td bgcolor="eeeeee"> 

<tr><td><B><A name="">11:10</a></b> <span class="a">And his father</span> that <span class="a">was blind</span>, rising up, began to run stumbling with his feet: and giving a servant his hand,
