"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",
"<span class='i'>Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever.</span>--<a href='3.html#14'>Alma 3:14</a>",
"<span class='i'>I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</span>--<a href='3.html#15'>Alma 3:15</a>",
"<span class='I'>If ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd ... the devil is your shepherd.</span>--<a href='5.html#39'>Alma 5:39</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",
"<span class='a'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges ... even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year....</span>--<a href='16.html#1'>Alma 16:1</a>",
"<span class='a'>Their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.</span>--<a href='16.html#11'>Alma 16:11</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",
"<span class='v'>He [Ammon] smote off their arms with his sword; for he did withstand their blows by smiting their arms with the edge of his sword.</span>--<a href='17.html#37'>Alma 17:37</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.   Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</span>--<a href='30.html#22'>Alma 30:22</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",
"<span class='i'>God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.</span>--<a href='30.html#47'>Alma 30:47</a>",
"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Amalekites were of a more wicked and murderous disposition than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='43.html#6'>Alma 43:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lord is with us; and ye behold that he has delivered you into our hands.</span>--<a href='44.html#3'>Alma 44:3</a>",
"<span class='i'>God ... has strengthened  our arms that we have gained power over you, by  our faith, by our religion, and by our rites of worship, and by  our church.</span>--<a href='44.html#5'>Alma 44:5</a>",
"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",
"<span class='i'>These dissenters ... became ... more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='47.html#36'>Alma 47:36</a>",
"<span class='a'>God would prosper them in the land, or in other words ... God ... would prosper them in the land.</span>--<a href='48.html#15'>Alma 48:15</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='50.html#22'>Alma 50:22</a>",
"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",
"<span class='i'>The remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty.</span>--<a href='51.html#20'>Alma 51:20</a>",
"<span class='g'>And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye.</span>--<a href='54.html#21'>Alma 54:21</a>",
"<span class='v'>We did slay upwards of two thousand of them after they had surrendered themselves prisoners of war.</span>--<a href='57.html#14'>Alma 57:14</a>",

<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>23:1</b>   <span class="a">Behold, now it came to pass</span> that the king of the Lamanites sent a proclamation among all his people, 
that they should not lay their hands on Ammon, or Aaron, or Omner, or Himni, nor either of their brethren who should 
go forth preaching the word of God, in whatsoever place they should be, in any part of their land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32"><a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a> (23:1, 4, 16, 17)
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>23:2</b>   Yea, he sent a decree among them, that they should not lay their hands on them to bind them, or to cast 
them into prison; neither should they spit upon them, nor smite them, nor cast them out of their synagogues, nor scourge 
them; neither should they cast stones at them, but that they should have free access to their houses, and also their 
temples, and their sanctuaries. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>23:3</b>   And thus they might go forth and preach the word according to their desires, for the king had been 
converted unto the Lord, and all his household; therefore he sent his proclamation throughout the land unto his people, 
that the word of God might have no obstruction, but that it might go forth throughout all the land, that his people 
might be convinced concerning the wicked traditions of their fathers, and that they might be convinced that they were 
all brethren, and that they ought not to murder, nor to plunder, nor to steal, nor to commit adultery, nor to commit 
any manner of wickedness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>23:4</b>   <span class="a">And now it came to pass</span> that when the king had sent forth this proclamation, that Aaron and his 
brethren went forth from city to city, and from one house of worship to another, establishing churches, and 
consecrating priests and teachers throughout the land among the Lamanites, to preach and to teach the word of God 
among them; and thus they began to have great success. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>23:5</b>   And thousands were brought to the knowledge of the Lord, yea, thousands were brought to believe in 
the traditions of the Nephites; and they were taught the records and prophecies which were handed down even to the 
present time. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>23:6</b>   And as sure as the Lord liveth, so sure as many as believed, or as many as were brought to the 
knowledge of the truth, through the preaching of Ammon and his brethren, according to the spirit of revelation and 
of prophecy, and the power of God working miracles in them -- yea, I say unto you, as the Lord liveth, as many of 
the Lamanites as believed in their preaching, and were converted unto the Lord, never did fall away. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>23:7</b>   For they became a righteous people; they did lay down the weapons of their rebellion, that they did 
not fight against God any more, neither against any of their brethren. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>23:8</b>   Now, these are they who were converted unto the Lord: <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>23:9</b>   The people of the Lamanites 
who were in the land of Ishmael; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>23:10</b>   And also of the people of the Lamanites who were in the land of Middoni; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>23:11</b>   And also of the people of the Lamanites who were in the city of Nephi; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>23:12</b>   And 
also of the people of the Lamanites who were in the land of Shilom, and who were in the land of Shemlon, and in 
the city of Lemuel, and in the city of Shimnilom. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>23:13</b>   And these are the names of the cities of the Lamanites which were converted unto the Lord; and these 
are they that laid down the weapons of their rebellion, yea, all their weapons of war; and they were all Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>23:14</b>   And the Amalekites were not converted, save only one; neither were any of the Amulonites; but they did 
harden their hearts, and also the hearts of the Lamanites in that part of the land wheresoever they dwelt, yea, and 
all their villages and all their cities. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>23:15</b>   Therefore, we have named all the cities of the Lamanites in which they did repent and come to the 
knowledge of the truth, and were converted. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>23:16</b>   <span class="a">And now it came to pass</span> that the king and those 
who were converted were desirous that they might have a name, that thereby they might be distinguished from their 
brethren; therefore the king consulted with Aaron and many of their priests, concerning the name that they should 
take upon them, that they might be distinguished. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>23:17</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that <span class="a">they called their 
names Anti-Nephi-Lehies; and they 
were called by this name and were no more called Lamanites.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1">The Lamanites that converted were called "Anti-Nephi-Lehies." Now <i>that's</i> 
a catchy name!</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>23:18</b>   And they began to be a very industrious people; yea, and they were friendly with the Nephites; 
therefore, they did open a correspondence with them, <span class="a">and the curse of God did no more follow them.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/inj1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<img src="../../images/int.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1">God's curse of the Lamanites was lifted from the "Anti-Nephi-Lehies." So did their skin became 
"white and delightsome" again?</font>
