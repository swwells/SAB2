<p><b><a href="../gen/pr_list.html">Genesis</a></b>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../gen/pr.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->
<p><li><i>"But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt 
surely die."</i><br>
God says that if Adam eats from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, then 
the day that he does so, he will die. But later Adam eats the forbidden 
fruit (<a href="../gen/3.html#6">3:6</a>) and yet lives for another
930 years (<a href="../gen/5.html#5">5:5</a>). <a href="../gen/2.html#17">2:17</a>

<p><li>As a punishment for killing Abel, God says Cain will be "a fugitive and a vagabond." Yet
in just a few verses (<a href="../gen/4.html#16">4:16-17</a>) Cain will settle down, marry, have a son, and build a city. This is
not the activity one would expect from a fugitive and a vagabond. <a href="../gen/4.html#12">4:12</a>

<p><li>God promises Abram and his descendants all of the land of Canaan. But both
  history and the bible (<a href="../acts/7.html#5">Acts 7:5</a> and <a href="../heb/11.html#13">Hebrews 11:13</a>)
  show that God's promise to Abram was not fulfilled. 
<a href="../gen/13.html#15">13:15</a>, <a href="../gen/15.html#18">15:18</a>, 
<a href="../gen/17.html#8">17:8</a>, <a href="../gen/28.html#13">28:13-14</a>

<p><li>How long was the Egyptian captivity? This verse says 400 years, 
but <a href="../ex/12.html#40">Exodus 12:40</a> and
<a href="../gal/3.html#17">Galatians 3:17</a> say 430 years. <a href="../gen/15.html#13">15:13</a>

<p><li>"In the fourth generation they [Abraham's descendants] shall come hither again." 
But, if we count Abraham, then their return occurred after seven generations: 
Abraham, Isaac (<a href="../gen/21.html#1">Gen 21:1-3</a>), Jacob 
(<a href="../gen/25.html#19">Gen.25:19-26</a>), Levi (<a href="../gen/35.html#22">Gen 35:22-23</a>), 
Kohath (<a href="../ex/6.html#16">Ex 6:16</a>), Amramn
(<a href="../ex/6.html#18">Ex 6:18</a>), and Moses 
(<a href="../ex/6.html#20">Ex 6:20</a>). <a href="../gen/15.html#16">15:16</a>

<p><li>God promises to make Isaac's descendents as numerous as &quot;the stars of heaven&quot;, 
which, of course, never happened. The Jews have always been, and will always be, 
a small minority. <a href="../gen/22.html#17">22:17-18</a>, <a href="../gen/26.html#4">26:4</a>

<p><li>God renames Jacob twice (<a href="../gen/32.html#28">32:28</a>, <a href="../gen/35.html#10">35:10</a>
). God says that Jacob will henceforth be called Israel, but the Bible continues to call 
him Jacob anyway (<a href="../gen/47.html#28">47:28-29</a>). And even God himself calls him Jacob 
in <a href="../gen/46.html#2">46:2</a>. <a href="../gen/32.html#28">32:28</a>, <a href="../gen/35.html#10">35:10</a>

<p><li>God calls Jacob Jacob, though he said in <A
href="../gen/32.html#28">Gen.32:28</A> and <A href="../gen/35.html#10">35:10</A> that he
would no longer be called Jacob but Israel. <a href="../gen/46.html#2">46:2</a>

<p><li>God promises to bring Jacob safely back from
Egypt, but Jacob dies in Egypt (<A href="../gen/47.html#28">Gen.47:28-29</A>) <a href="../gen/46.html#3">46:3</a>

<p><li>The tribe of Judah will reign "until Shiloh," but Israel's first king (Saul) was from the tribe
of Benjamin (<a href="../acts/13.html#21">Acts 13:21</a>), and most of the time after this prophecy there was no king at all. 
<a href="../gen/49.html#10">49:10</a>

<p><li>"He washed his garments in wine ... His eyes shall be red with wine."<br>
    Did Judah really wash his clothes in wine? Were his eyes bloodshot from drinking too much? Or is this a prophecy of Jesus? 
    (I didn't know Jesus had a drinking problem.) <a href="../gen/49.html#11">49:11-12</a>
    
<p><li>Contrary to the prophecy in <a href="../gen/48.html#21">48:21</a>, Joseph died in Egypt, not Israel. 
<a href="../gen/50.html#24" >Gen.50:24</a>

<p><li>God promises to cast out many nations including the Canaanites and the Jebusites. But he was unable to fulfill his promise.   
<a href="../ex/33.html#2">33:2</a>

<p><li>In this verse God says he will write on the stone tablets, but in <a href="../ex/34.html#27">34:27</a> he tells Moses to do the 
writing.  <a href="../ex/34.html#1">34:1</a>

<p><li>God promises to cast out seven nations including the Amorites, Canaanites, and the Jebusites. But he was unable to
fulfill his promise. <a href="../dt/7.html#1">7:1</a>

<p><li>God says that the Israelites will destroy all of the peoples they encounter. But according to Joshua 
(<a href="../jos/15.html#63">15:63</a>, <a href="../jos/16.html#10">16:10</a>,
<a href="../jos/17.html#12">17:12-13</a>) and Judges (<a href="../jg/1.html#21">1:21</a>,

infertility and diseases on the other guys.)  <a href="../dt/7.html#14">7:14-15</a>

<p><li>Prophets and dreamers are to be executed if they say or dream the wrong things.  
<a href="../dt/13.html#1">13:1-5</a>

<p><li>False prophets are to be (you guessed it) executed. How do you know who is a false prophet? By whether or not their
predictions come true. (Watch out Jehovah's Witnesses!)  <a href="../dt/18.html#20">18:20</a>

<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../jos/pr.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p><li>God promises to give Joshua all of the land that his "foot shall tread upon." He says that none of the people he
encounters will be able to resist him. But later we find that God didn't keep his promise, and that many tribes withstood
Joshua's attempt to steal their land.  <a href="../jos/1.html#3">1:3-5</a>

<p><li>Joshua tells the Israelites that God will "without fail" drive out the Canaanites and the Jebusites. But later, the Bible
tells us that he could not drive them out.  <a href="../jos/3.html#10">3:10</a>

<p><li>This verse says that Ai was never again occupied after it was destroyed by Joshua. But Nehemiah 
(<a href="../neh/7.html#32">7:32</a>) lists it among the cities of Israel at the time of the Babylonian captivity. 
 <a href="../jos/8.html#28">8:28</a>
 
<p><li>God promised the Israelites that he would drive out all the inhabitants of the lands they pass through. But this verse
shows that he didn't keep his promise since he couldn't drive out the Jebusites.  <a href="../jos/15.html#63">15:63</a>

<p><li>"And they drave not out the Canaanites." Once again God fails keep his promise to destroy all the people the
Israelites encounter. <a href="../jos/16.html#10">16:10</a>

<p><li>The Israelites, contrary to God's promises to them, could not drive out the Canaanites.  <a href="../jos/17.html#12">17:12-13</a>

<p><li>Joshua tells Manasseh that he will be able to drive out the Canaanites, but it turns out (see <a href="../jos/1.html#27">1:27-28</a>) that he
couldn't do it.  <a href="../jos/17.html#17">17:17-18</a>

<p><li>According to these verses, God fulfilled his promise to give the Israelites all of the lands that they encountered.
But in several places the Bible tells us that these promises were not kept.  <a href="../jos/21.html#43">21:43-45</a>

<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../is/pr.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p><li>God told Isaiah to tell Ahaz, the King of Judah, not to be concerned about Rezin (the king of Syria) or Pekah (the king of
Israel). But according to <a href="../2chr/28.html#5">2 Chr 28:5-6</a> "God delivered him [Ahaz] into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and
carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the
king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter."  <a href="../is/7.html#3">7:3-7</a>

<p><li>The King James Version mistranslates the Hebrew word "almah", which means "young woman" as "virgin". (The Hebrew
word, "bethulah", means "virgin".) In addition, the young woman referred to in this verse was living at the time of the prophecy.
And Jesus, of course, was called Jesus -- and is not called Emmanuel in any verse in the New Testament.  
<a href="../is/7.html#14">7:14</a>

<p><li>As a sign that he's getting ready to destroy the world, God will destroy the whole universe. <a href="../is/13.html#10">13:10-13</a>

<p><li>These verses falsely predict that Babylon will never again be inhabited.  <a href="../is/13.html#19">13:19-20</a>

<p><li>Dragons will live in Babylonian palaces and satyrs will dance there.  <a href="../is/13.html#21">13:21-22</a>

<p><li>Every head will be bald, every beard will be shaved, and everyone will howl and weep abundantly. <a href="../is/15.html#2">15:2-3</a>

<p><li>"Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl." <a href="../is/16.html#7">16:7</a>

<p><li>"Within three years ... the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant 
shall be very small and feeble." <a href="../is/16.html#14">16:14</a>

<p><li>This verse prophesies that Damascus will be completely destroyed and no longer be inhabited. Yet Damascus has never
been completely destroyed and is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities.  <a href="../is/17.html#1">17:1</a>

<p><li>God will ride in on a cloud and scare the hell out of the Egyptians. <a href="../is/19.html#1">19:1</a>

<p><li>The river of Egypt (identified as the Nile in RSV) shall dry up. This has never occurred.  <a href="../is/19.html#5">19:5</a>

<p><li>"The land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt." Judah never invaded Egypt and was never a 
military threat to Egypt. <a href="../is/19.html#17">19:17</a>

<p><li>This verse predicts that there shall be five cities in Egypt that speak the Canaanite language. But that language was never
spoken in Egypt, and it is extinct now.  <a href="../is/19.html#18">19:18</a>

<p><li>These verses predict that the Egyptians will worship the Lord (Yahweh) with sacrifices and offerings. But Judaism has
never been an important religion in Egypt.  <a href="../is/19.html#18">19:18-21</a>

<p><li>These verses predict that there will be an alliance between Egypt, Israel, and Assyria. But there has never been any
such alliance, and it's unlikely that it ever will since Assyria no longer exists.  <a href="../is/19.html#23">19:23-24</a>

<p><li>"They have ... changed the ordinance. There is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, the mirth
    of the land is gone."<br>
    Is this a prophecy about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition#Prohibition_in_the_United_States">prohibition in 
    the United States</a>? <a href="../is/24.html#5">24:5-11</a>

<p><li>"The priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink." You can't even trust a drunken prophet anymore.  
<a href="../is/28.html#7">28:7</a>

<p><li>"Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation
    a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that
    believeth shall not make haste."<br>
Misquoted in <a href="../rom/9.html#33">Romans 9:33</a> as: "As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of
    offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed." <a href="../is/28.html#16">28:16</a>

<p><li>"The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be
     sevenfold." Well, this is one prophecy that will never come true. Since the moon has no light of its own, but only 
     reflects that of the sun, it could never shine like the sun. And the sun will not, at least not while there are humans to see 
     it, shine 7 times as bright as it does now.  <a href="../is/30.html#26">30:26</a>
     
     <p><li>"The host of heaven shall be dissolved ... and ... shall fall down."<br>
The stars will dissolve and fall from the sky. <a href="../is/34.html#4">34:4</a>
     
<p><li>"Henceforth there shall no more come into thee [Jerusalem] the uncircumcised and the unclean." But many
uncircumcised people have visited and occupied Jerusalem after this prophecy was made. 
 <a href="../is/52.html#1">52:1</a>
 
<p><li> Isaiah 53 is probably the most often used "prophecy" that is claimed by Christian apologists to 
refer to Jesus. <a href="http://www.godlesshaven.com/articles/isaiah53.html">But the context indicates otherwise.</a> The 
"suffering servant" that is referred to here is Israel, not Jesus. <a href="../is/53.html#1">53:1-12</a> 
 
<p><li>Nations that do not serve Israel will perish.  <a href="../is/60.html#12">60:12</a>

<p><li>"The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me."<br>
    These words were spoken by Isaiah and referred to Isaiah. They were not a prophecy about a future prophet, as Jesus 
     claimed in <a href="../lk/4.html#16">Luke 4:16-19</a>, where he supposedly read these verses in the synagogue while applying 
     them to himself.  <a href="../is/61.html#1">61:1-2</a>

<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../jer/pr.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->
<p><li> Jeremiah prophesies that all nations of the earth will embrace Judaism. 
This has not happened.  <a href="../jer/3.html#17">3:17</a>

<p><li> "The prophets prophesy falsely."  <a href="../jer/5.html#31">5:31</a>

<p><li>God will make Jerusalem an uninhabited "den of dragons."  <a href="../jer/9.html#11">9:11</a>

<p><li> Judah will become a desolate den of dragons.  <a href="../jer/10.html#22">10:22</a>

<p><li>"The prophets prophesy lies" in God's name. <a href="../jer/14.html#14">14:14</a>

<p><li> God will destroy by famine and sword those who are misled by the prophets, as well as the prophets 
themselves.  <a href="../jer/14.html#15">14:15-16</a>

<p><li> Matthew (<a href="../mt/1.html#12">1:12</a>) lists Jeconiah as an ancestor of Jesus -- which, according to this prophecy, 
disqualifies Jesus as the Messiah. <a href="../jer/22.html#28">22:28-30</a>

<p><li>God's prophets are profane, wicked, adulterous, lying sodomites. <a href="../jer/23.html#11">23:11-14</a>

<p><li>God damned lying prophets <a href="../jer/23.html#25">23:25-40</a>

<p><li>God says he is going to punish Nebuchadnezzar and the 
Babylonians for what they have done to his people -- even though God Himself is the one who made the 
Babylonians attack and enslave Judah!  As part of the punishment God will take the land of the 
Babylonians and "make it perpetual desolations."  A false prophecy, since present-day Iraq is quite 
occupied.<a href="../jer/25.html#12">25:12-13</a>

<p><li>Hananiah vs. Jeremiah: Good Prophet, Bad Prophet <a href="../jer/28.html#1">28:1-17</a>

<p><li>A new prophet shows up proclaiming the good news: God was going to break the yoke of Babylon and bring the people of Judah back home. 
His name was Hananiah. <a href="../jer/28.html#1">28:1-4</a>

<p><li>God kills Hananiah for disagreeing with Jeremiah. <a href="../jer/28.html#16">28:16-17</a>

<p><li> God will send his usual blessings upon his people: "the sword, the famine, and the pestilence." He "will make
them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil." <a href="../jer/29.html#17">29:17-18</a>

<p><li> Matthew (<A href="../mt/2.html#17">2:17-18</A>) quotes this verse, claiming that it was a prophecy 
of King Herod's alleged slaughter of the children in and around Bethlehem after the birth of Jesus. But
this passage refers to the Babylonian captivity, as is clear by reading the next two verses (16 and 17), 
and, thus, has nothing to do with Herod's massacre. <a href="../jer/31.html#15">31:15</a>

<p><li>Misquoted in <a href="../heb/8.html#9">Hebrews 8:9</a> as:<br>
"Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day
    when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because
    they continued not in my covenant, and <i>I regarded them not</i>, saith the Lord." <a href="../jer/31.html#32">31:32</a>
    
<p><li> &quot;David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel.&quot; But the Davidic line of Kings ended with Zedekiah; there were none during the Babylonian captivity, and there
are none today. <a href="../jer/33.html#17">33:17</a>

<p><li>God lies to Zedekiah again by telling him that
he will die in peace and be buried with his fathers. But later (<A
href="../2kg/25.html#7">2 Kgings 25:7</A> and <A href="../jer/52.html#10">52:10-11</A>)
he dies a violent death in a foreign land. <a href="../jer/34.html#2">34:2, 5</a>

<p><li> The beginning of the end for Zedekiah.  Despite God's earlier assurances 
(<a href="../jer/34.html#5" >34:5</a>) that he would die peacefully at home, here 
Zedekiah watches as his children are killed and then has his eyes put out and he 
is shackled and taken to Babylon.&nbsp; <a href="../jer/39.html#6">39:6-7</a>

<p><li>All those who move to Egypt will die by the sword, famine, or pestilence. None &quot;shall 
escape from the evil&quot; that comes directly from God. But many, including Jews, have moved to Egypt 
and most seem to have escaped from God's promised evil.  <a href="../jer/42.html#15">42:15-18, 22</a>

<p><li>God will kill the young men of Damascus and set the city on fire. (Some Christians believe this prophecy is being fulfulled today in Syrian civil war.) <a href="../jer/49.html#26">49:26-27</a>

<p><li> Jeremiah predicts that humans will never again live in Hazor, but will be replaced by dragons. 
But people still live there and dragons have never been seen. <a href="../jer/49.html#33">49:33</a>

<p><li> God prophesies that Babylon will never again be inhabited. But it has been inhabited constantly since the prophecy was 
supposedly made, and is inhabited still today. <a href="../jer/50.html#39">50:39</a>

<p><li> God says that Babylon will be desolate and uninhabited forever. He says that only dragons will live there. But Babylon has been 
dragon-free and continuously inhabited since then. <a href="../jer/51.html#26">51:26, 29, 37, 43, 62, 64</a>

<p><li>"The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the
    waves thereof." <a href="../jer/51.html#42">51:42</a>  

<p><li> God promised Zedekiah (<A href="../jer/34.html#5">Jeremiah 34:5</A>) that he would die peacefully and be buried with his fathers. 
But here we see that he died a miserable death in foreign land. <a href="../jer/52.html#10">52:10-11</a>

<p><li> God deceives some of his prophets and then kills them for believing his lies. 
<a href="../ezek/14.html#9">14:9</a>

<p><li> Ezekiel prophesies that Tyrus will be completely destroyed by Nebuchadrezzar and will never be built again. But it wasn't 
destroyed, as evidenced by the visits to Tyre by Jesus and Paul (<A href="../mt/15.html#21">Mt 15:21</A>,

    securely, never again to fight neighboring nations. <a href="../ezek/28.html#24">28:24-26</a>
    
<p><li> Ezekiel makes another false prophecy: that Egypt would be uninhabited by humans or animals for forty years after being destroyed by 
Nebuchadrezzar. But there was never a time when Egypt was uninhabited. Humans and animals have lived there continuously since Ezekiel's prophecy.  
<a href="../ezek/29.html#10">29:10-11</a>

<p><li> "The day of the LORD is near ... it shall be the time of the heathen."  <a href="../ezek/30.html#3">30:3</a>

<p><li> The rivers of Egypt (identified as the Nile in NIV, NASB, and RSV) shall dry up. This has 
never occurred.  <a href="../ezek/30.html#12">30:12</a>

<p><li> Ezekiel prophesies God will protect 
the Israelites from "the heathen". "And they shall be safe in their land." But the Israelites have 
never lived peacefully with their neighbors, and they've never been safe from attack.
  <a href="../ezek/34.html#28">34:28-29</a>

The gospel of Matthew (<A href="../mt/2.html#5">2:5-6</A>) claims that Jesus'
birth in Bethlehem fulfils this prophecy. But this is unlikely for two reasons.
<OL type="i">

  <li>&quot;Bethlehem Ephratah&quot; in Micah 5:2 refers not to a town, but to a
    clan: the clan of Bethlehem, who was the son of Caleb's second wife,
    Ephrathah (<A href="../1chr/2.html#18">1 Chr 2:18</A>, <A

  <li>The prophecy (if that is what it is) does not refer to the Messiah, but
    rather to a military leader, as can be seen from verse <A href="../mic/5.html#6">5:6</A>.
    This leader is supposed to defeat the Assyrians, which, of course, Jesus
    never did.
</OL>

It should also be noted that Matthew altered the text of Micah 5:2 by saying:
&quot;And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda&quot; rather than &quot;Bethlehem
Ephratah&quot; as is said in Micah 5:2. He did this, intentionally no doubt, to
make the verse appear to refer to the town of Bethlehem rather than the family
clan. <a href="../mic/5.html#2">5:2</a>

<p><li>The prophecy given in <A
href="../is/7.html#14">Isaiah 7:14</A> referred not to a virgin but to a young
woman, living at the time of the prophecy. And Jesus, of course, was called
Jesus -- and is not called Emmanuel in any verse in the New Testament. <a href="../mt/1.html#23">1:23</a>

<p><li>Matthew claims that Jesus' birth in Bethlehem
fulfils the prophecy in <A href="../mic/5.html#2">Micah 5:2</A>. But this is
unlikely for two reasons.
<uL>
  <li>&quot;Bethlehem Ephratah&quot; in Micah 5:2 refers not to a town, but to a
    clan: the clan of Bethlehem, who was the son of Caleb's second wife,
    Ephrathah (<A href="../1chr/2.html#18">1 Chr 2:18</A>, <A
    href="../1chr/2.html#50">2:50-52</A>, <A href="../1chr/4.html#4">4:4</A>).
    
  <li>The prophecy (if that is what it is) does not refer to the Messiah, but
    rather to a military leader, as can be seen from <A href="../mic/5.html#6">Micah
    5:6</A>. This leader is supposed to defeat the Assyrians, which, of course,
    Jesus never did.
</uL>
It should also be noted that Matthew altered the text of Micah 5:2 by saying:
&quot;And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda&quot; rather than &quot;Bethlehem
Ephratah&quot; as is said in Micah 5:2. He did this, intentionally no doubt, to
make the verse appear to refer to the town of Bethlehem rather than the family
clan. <a href="../mt/2.html#5">2:5-6</a>

<p><li> &quot;Out of Egypt I have called my son,&quot;<BR>
Matthew claims that the flight of Jesus' family to Egypt is a fulfillment of <A
href="../hos/11.html#1">Hosea 11:1</A>. But Hosea 11:1 is not a prophecy at all,
as is clear when the entire verse is quoted (&quot;When Israel was a child, then
I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.&quot;). It is a reference to the
Hebrew exodus from Egypt and has nothing to do with Jesus. Matthew tries to hide
this fact by quoting only the last part of the verse. <a href="../mt/2.html#15">2:15</a>

<p><li>Matthew quotes <A href="../jer/31.html#15">Jeremiah
31:15</A>, claiming that it was a prophecy of King Herod's alleged slaughter of
the children in and around Bethlehem after the birth of Jesus. But this verse
refers to the Babylonian captivity, as is clear by reading the next two verses
(16 and 17), and, thus, has nothing to do with Herod's massacre. <a href="../mt/2.html#17">2:17-18</a>

<p><li>&quot;He shall be called a Nazarene.&quot;
Matthew claims this was a fulfillment of prophecy, yet such a prophecy is not
found anywhere in the Old Testament. <a href="../mt/2.html#23">2:23</a>

<p><li>The devil correctly quotes scripture (<A
href="../ps/91.html#11">Ps 91:11-12</A>), while Jesus misquotes Deuteronomy by
adding &quot;only&quot; to <A href="../dt/6.html#13">Dt 6:13</A>. <a href="../mt/4.html#6">4:6, 10</a>

<p><li>Families will be torn apart because of Jesus (this is one of the few "prophecies" in the Bible that has actually come
true). "Brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents,
and cause them to be put to death."  <a href="../mt/10.html#21">10:21</a>

<p><li>Jesus tells his disciples that he will return before they can "go over the cities of Israel." Later (<a href="../mt/24.html#14">24:14</a>) 
he says he will not come until the gospel is preached throughout the world. Well, his disciples went over the cities of Israel and then died
waiting for the "return of the Lord." Now, nearly 2000 years later, and long after the gospel had been preached throughout the
world, his followers still wait. <a href="../mt/10.html#23">10:23</a>

<p><li>When Jesus and his disciples are accused of breaking the Sabbath, he excuses himself by referring to a scripture in
which priests who "profaned the Sabbath" were blameless. But there is no such passage in the Old Testament.

<A href="../ezek/28.html#19">28:19</A>) was not supposed to exist. <a href="../mt/15.html#21">15:21</a>

<p><li>Jesus mistakenly tells his followers that he will return and establish his kingdom within their lifetime. 
 <a href="../mt/16.html#28">16:28</a>
 
<p><li>This verse claims that Jesus fulfils the prophecy in <A href="../zech/9.html#9">Zechariah 9:9</A>. 
But this cannot be since the person referred to in Zechariah (see verses 
<A href="../zech/9.html#10">10-13</A>) was both a military leader and the king of an earthly kingdom.
 <a href="../mt/21.html#4">21:4</a>
 
<p><li>Jesus predicts the end of the world within the lifetime of his listeners.  <a href="../mt/23.html#36">23:36</a>

<p><li>The end of the world will be signaled by wars, famines, disease, and earthquakes (6-7). And that's just 
    "the beginning of sorrows" (8). Next believers will be hated and killed by unbelievers (9), believers will hate and betray each other (10), false 
    prophets will fool people (11), iniquity will abound and love wax cold (12). But hey, if you make through all that, you'll be saved (13).  
    
    <p>Only one more thing will happen before the end comes: the gospel will be preached throughout the world (14). Well, that and the abomination 
    of desolations will stand in the holy place (15), many false Christs and false prophets will show great signs and wonders (24), the sun and moon 
    will be darkened and the stars will fall (29), the sign of the son of Man will appear in the sky, everyone on earth will mourn, and then, 
    finally, the great and powerful son of Man will come in all his glory (30).
    
    <p>Oh, and all these things will happen within the lifespan of Jesus' contemporaries (34).
    
    <p>Or maybe not. Jesus was talking about things he knew nothing about (36). (See <a href="../mk/13.html#32">Mark 13:32</a>.)
  <a href="../mt/24.html#3">24:3-51</a>
    
<p><li>Jesus says the gospel will be preached to all nations &quot;and then shall the end come. Well according 
to Paul the gospel has been preached to everyone (<a href="../rom/10.html#18">Rom.10:18</a>) yet the 
end hasn't come. <a href="../mt/24.html#14">24:14</a>

<p><li>Jesus is a false prophet, since he predicts
that the end of the world will come within the lifetimes of his disciples. The world of course didn't end </A>then, and
according to <A href="../ec/1.html#4">Ec.1:4</A> it never will end. <a href="../mt/24.html#34">24:34</a>

<p><li>"But all this was done, that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled." What scriptures? What prophets?
There is no such prophecy in the Old Testament.  <a href="../mt/26.html#5">26:56</a>

<p><li>Jesus falsely prophesies that the high priest would see his second coming.  <a href="../mt/26.html#64">26:64</a>

<p><li>This is not a quote from Jeremiah, but a misquote of Zechariah (<A

<p><li>Mark claims that John the Baptist fulfilled the prophecy given in Malachi 
(<a href="../mal/3.html#1">3:1</a>, <a href="../mal/4.html#1">4:1, 5</a>). But the Malachi prophecy says that God 
will send Elijah before "the great and dreadful day of the LORD" in which the world will be consumed by fire. Yet John the 
Baptist flatly denied that he was Elijah (Elias) in <a href="../jn/1.html#21">John 1:21</a> and the earth was not destroyed after 
John's appearance.  <a href="../mk/1.html#2">1:2</a>

<p><li>Ezekiel (<A href="../ezek/26.html#14">26:14,
21</A>, <A href="../ezek/27.html#36">27:36</A>) prophesied that Tyre would be
completely destroyed, never to be built again. But it wasn't destroyed and
continued to exist, as shown by this verse in which Jesus visits Tyre. <a href="../mk/7.html#24">7:24, 31</a>

<p><li>Jesus misquotes Deuteronomy by adding &quot;only&quot; to <A href="../dt/6.html#13">Dt.6:13</A>. <a href="../lk/4.html#8">4:8</a>

<p><li>"The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me."<br>
    These words were spoken by Isaiah and referred to Isaiah. They were not a prophecy 
    about a future prophet, as Jesus 
     claims here, where he supposedly read these verses in the synagogue while applying 
     them to himself.  <a href="../lk/4.html#16">4:16-20</a>
     
<p><li>Jesus falsely predicts that some of his listeners would live to see him return and establish the kingdom of God. 
 <a href="../lk/9.html#27">9:27</a>
 
<p><li>Jesus prophesies that families will be divided because of him and his teachings. Sadly, this is one prophecy
that has been fulfilled.  <a href="../lk/12.html#52">12:52-53</a>

<p><li>There will be nothing subtle about Jesus' return. It will be like lightning that flashes from one end of the heaven to the other. 
Like the Wicked Witch of the West writing "Surrender Dorothy" in the sky. Like that. <a href="../lk/17.html#24">17:24</a>

<p><li>Before the end of the world there will be many false Christs that claim the end of the world is near (Don't believe them) (8), 
there will be "wars and commotions" (but ignore that) (9), along with earthquakes, famines, pestilences, and "fearful sights" and 
"great signs from heaven" (11).

<p>Believers will be arrested and persecuted by the Jews, who will throw them in prison (12), friends and family will betray each other and 
some will be put to death (16), and believers will be hated by everyone (17). But don't worry. Not a single hair on your head will be 
hurt (even if you are killed) (18).

<p>When you see armies around Jerusalem, then you'll know desolation is near (20). Then it's time to head for the hills. Unless you're a 
pregnant or nursing women, that is. (23) Then you're just fucked. Too bad for you.

<p>God's wrath will be on everyone, with dead bodies all over the place, 
Jerusalem will be trodden on by Gentiles until "the times of the 
Gentiles be fulfilled." (24) There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars, with lots of waves in the sea. (25)

<p>Everyone will be afraid of everything (26) and then they'll see the Son of Man coming in all his glory. (27)

<p>Oh, and all these things will happen within the lifespan of Jesus' contemporaries (32). <a href="../lk/21.html#7">21:8-27</a>

<p><li>Jesus says that all that he describes (his return, signs in the sun, moon, and stars, etc.) will occur within the 
 within the lifetime of his listeners. <a href="../lk/21.html#32">21:32</a>
 
<p><li>Jesus claims that his suffering and death were a fulfillment of prophecy. But there is no such prophecy in the
Old Testament.  <a href="../lk/24.html#44">24:44, 46</a>

<p><li>Jesus falsely prophesied that Nathaniel would see heaven open and angels descend upon Jesus. Nathaniel never saw it; 
neither has anyone else. <a href="../jn/1.html#51">1:51</a>

<p><li>Jesus says that "the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear 
the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live."  <a href="../jn/5.html#25">5:25, 28</a>

<p><li>Jesus claims that Moses wrote about him. Where? It's a shame he didn't give us chapter and verse. 
 <a href="../jn/5.html#46">5:46</a>
 
<p><li>Jesus says that those who believe in him will, as the scripture says, have living waters flowing out of their
bellies. Well that sounds like fun, but there is no such scripture in the Bible.  <a href="../jn/7.html#38">7:38</a>

<p><li>Jesus falsely prophesies that "there shall be one fold, and one shepherd." This will never happen as long as
Christian beliefs are based on the Bible.  <a href="../jn/10.html#16">10:16</a>

<p><li>This verse claims that Jesus fulfils the prophecy in <a href="../zech/9.html#9">Zechariah 9:9</a>. But this cannot be 
since the person referred to in Zechariah (see verses 10-13) was both a military leader and the king of an earthly kingdom.  
<a href="../jn/12.html#15">12:15</a>

<p><li>Verse 33 says that during Jesus' crucifixion, the soldiers didn't break his legs because he was already dead.
Verse 36 claims that this fulfilled a prophecy: "Not a bone of him shall be broken." But there is no such prophecy.
It is sometimes said that the prophecy appears in <a href="../ex/12.html#46">Ex 12:46</a>, 
<a href="../num/9.html#12">Num  9:12</a> and <a href="../ps/34.html#20">Ps 34:20</a>. This is not correct.
Exodus 12:46 and Num.9:12 are not prophecies, they are 
commandments. The Israelites are told not to break the bones of the Passover lamb, and this is all it is about. And 
Psalm 34:20 seems to refer to righteous people in general
(see verse 19, where a plural is used), not to make a prophecy about a specific person.  <a href="../jn/19.html#33">19:33, 36</a>

<p><li><a href="../gen/49.html#10">Gen 49:10</a> says that all of Israel's kings will be from the

<p><li>Paul quotes God as saying, "I have found David the

<p><li>"Where is the promise of his coming?"<br>
The author of 2 Peter is aware of the failed expectations of
early believers. He knows that Jesus, who was to come soon, didn't come at all.
Many have begun to ask, &quot;Where is the promise of his coming?&quot; He tries
to cover for Jesus by claiming that &quot;one day with the Lord is as a thousand
years.&quot; <a href="../2pet/3.html#4">3:4</a>

<p><li>Enoch, "the seventh from Adam", prophesied that God would come
with 10,000 of his saints &quot;to execute judgment upon all.&quot; But this 
prophecy is from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Enoch">Book of Enoch</a>, not from 
the Bible.  <a href="../jude/1.html#14">14-15</a>

<p><li>John believed that the things that he wrote about would happen soon, within his own lifetime. 
After nearly 2000 years, believers still believe that "the time is at hand" and 
that the events described in Revelation will "shortly come to pass." <a href="../rev/1.html#1">1:1, 3</a>

<p><li>"Every eye shall see him," including those who executed him. Everyone will "wail because of him." But 
millions have lived and died without ever seeing him coming "with clouds." 
<a href="../rev/1.html#7">1:7</a>

<p><li>John quotes Jesus (1900 years ago) as saying, &quot;Behold, I come quickly." <a href="../rev/3.html#11">3:11</a>, 
<a href="../rev/22.html#7">22:7</a>, <a href="../rev/22.html#12">12</a>, <a href="../rev/22.html#20">20</a>

<p><li>"And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth...." To John, the stars are just little lights a few miles away that can
easily fall to the earth.  <a href="../rev/6.html#13">6:13</a>

<p><li>"And the name of the star is called Wormwood."<br>
Some believers say that the 1986 nuclear disaster at Chernobyl was the fulfillment of the 
third trumpet in 8:10-11.  <a href="../rev/8.html#10">8:10-11</a>

<p><li>"And there was no more sea."<br>
For an old sailor like me, this verse, if it were true, would 
be one of the saddest verses in the Bible.  <a href="../rev/21.html#1">21:1</a>

<p><li>"Things which must shortly be done"  <a href="../rev/22.html#6">22:6</a>
