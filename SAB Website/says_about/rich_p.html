<dl>
<dt>They are going to hell.
<p><dd>There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day: And there was 
a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores, And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell 
from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.   And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was 
carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried; And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in 
torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and 
send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. But Abraham 
said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is 
comforted, and thou art tormented. -- <a href="../lk/16.html#19">Luke 16:19-25</a>

<p><dd>Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto 
    you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.  And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye
    of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
    -- <a href="../mt/19.html#23">Matthew 19:23-24</a>, <a href="../mk/10.html#23">Mark 10:23-25</a>

<p><dd>But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation. -- <a href="../lk/6.html#24">Luke 6:24</a>

<p><dd>Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. 
-- <a href="../jas/5.html#1">James 5:1</a>
