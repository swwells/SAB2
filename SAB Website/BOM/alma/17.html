"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",
"<span class='i'>Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever.</span>--<a href='3.html#14'>Alma 3:14</a>",
"<span class='i'>I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</span>--<a href='3.html#15'>Alma 3:15</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",
"<span class='a'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges ... even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year....</span>--<a href='16.html#1'>Alma 16:1</a>",
"<span class='a'>Their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.</span>--<a href='16.html#11'>Alma 16:11</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",
"<span class='v'>He [Ammon] smote off their arms with his sword; for he did withstand their blows by smiting their arms with the edge of his sword.</span>--<a href='17.html#37'>Alma 17:37</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.   Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</span>--<a href='30.html#22'>Alma 30:22</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",
"<span class='i'>God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.</span>--<a href='30.html#47'>Alma 30:47</a>",
"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Amalekites were of a more wicked and murderous disposition than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='43.html#6'>Alma 43:6</a>",

"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",
"<span class='i'>These dissenters ... became ... more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='47.html#36'>Alma 47:36</a>",
"<span class='a'>God would prosper them in the land, or in other words ... God ... would prosper them in the land.</span>--<a href='48.html#15'>Alma 48:15</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='50.html#22'>Alma 50:22</a>",
"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",
"<span class='i'>The remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty.</span>--<a href='51.html#20'>Alma 51:20</a>",
"<span class='g'>And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye.</span>--<a href='54.html#21'>Alma 54:21</a>",
"<span class='v'>We did slay upwards of two thousand of them after they had surrendered themselves prisoners of war.</span>--<a href='57.html#14'>Alma 57:14</a>",

<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>17:1</b>   <span class="a">And now it came to pass</span> that as Alma was journeying from the land of 
Gideon southward, away to the land of Manti, behold, to his astonishment, he met with the sons of Mosiah journeying 
towards the land of Zarahemla. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32"><a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a> <br>(17:1, 9, 10, 12, 13, 24, 25, 31, 32)
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>17:2</b>   Now these sons of Mosiah were with Alma at the time the angel first appeared unto him; therefore Alma 
did rejoice <span class="a">exceedingly</span> to see his brethren; and what added more to his joy, they were still his 
brethren in the Lord; yea, and they had waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth; for they were men of a sound 
understanding and they had searched the scriptures diligently, that they might know the word of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32"><a href="exceed_list.html">Exceedingly</a> (17:2, 28)
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>17:3</b>   But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting; therefore they had the spirit 
of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and when they taught, they taught with power and authority of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>17:4</b>   And they had been teaching the word of God for the space of fourteen years among the Lamanites, having 
had much success in bringing many to the knowledge of the truth; yea, by the power of their words many were brought 
before the altar of God, to call on his name and confess their sins before him. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>17:5</b>   Now these are the circumstances which attended them in their journeyings, for they had many afflictions; 
they did suffer much, both in body and in mind, such as hunger, thirst and fatigue, and also much labor in the 
spirit. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>17:6</b>   Now these were their journeyings: Having taken leave of their father, Mosiah, in the first year of the 
judges; having refused the kingdom which their father was desirous to confer upon them, and also this was the minds of 
the people; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>17:7</b>   Nevertheless they departed out of the land of Zarahemla, and took their 
<span class="sci">swords</span>, and their spears, and 
their bows, and their arrows, and their slings; and this they did that they might provide food for themselves while 
in the wilderness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/sci1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1">Swords (presumably made of metal) are again mentioned as though though they were common in pre-Columbian 
America. But no evidence for their existence has ever been found.</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>17:8</b>   And thus they departed into the wilderness with their numbers which they had selected, to go up to 
the land of Nephi, to preach the word of God unto the Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>17:9</b>   <span class="a">And it came to 
pass</span> that they journeyed many days in the wilderness, and they fasted much and prayed much that the Lord 
would grant unto them a portion of his Spirit to go with them, and abide with them, that they might be an instrument 
in the hands of God to bring, if it were possible, their brethren, the Lamanites, to the knowledge of the truth, to 
the knowledge of the baseness of the traditions of their fathers, which were not correct. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>17:10</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Lord did visit them with his Spirit, and said 
unto them: Be comforted.  And they were comforted. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>17:11</b>   And the Lord said unto them also: Go forth among the Lamanites, thy brethren, and establish my word; 
yet ye shall be patient in long-suffering and afflictions, that ye may show forth good examples unto them in me, and I 
will make an instrument of thee in my hands unto the salvation of many souls. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>17:12</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the hearts of the sons of Mosiah, and also those who 
were with them, took courage to go forth unto the Lamanites to declare unto them the word of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>17:13</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> when they had arrived in the borders 
of the land of <span class="i">the 
Lamanites</span>, that they separated themselves and departed one from another, trusting in the Lord that they should meet 
again at the close of their harvest; for they supposed that great was the work which they had undertaken. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">


<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>17:14</b>   And assuredly it was great, for they had undertaken to preach the word of God to 
<span class="i">a wild and a 
hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them; 
and their hearts were set upon riches, or upon gold and silver, and precious stones; yet they sought to obtain these 
things by murdering and plundering, that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/inj1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<img src="../../images/int.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1">The Lamanites were a wild, ferocious, and lazy people who delighted in 
murdering, robbing, and 
plundering. God cursed them because of what their fathers did.</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>17:15</b>   <span class="i">Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen 
upon them because of the traditions of their fathers;</span> notwithstanding the promises of the Lord were extended unto them 
on the conditions of repentance. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>17:16</b>   Therefore, this was the cause for which the sons of Mosiah had undertaken the work, that perhaps they 
might bring them unto repentance; that perhaps they might bring them to know of the plan of redemption. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>17:17</b>   Therefore they separated themselves one from another, and went forth among them, every man alone, 
according to the word and power of God which was given unto him. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>17:18</b>   Now Ammon being the chief among them, or rather he did administer unto them, and he departed from them, 
after having blessed them according to their several stations, having imparted the word of God unto them, or 
administered unto them before his departure; and thus they took their several journeys throughout the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>17:19</b>   And Ammon went to the land of Ishmael, the land being called after the sons of Ishmael, who also became 
Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>17:20</b>   And as Ammon entered the land of Ishmael, the Lamanites took him and bound him, as was 
their custom to bind all the Nephites who fell into their hands, and carry them before the king; and thus it was left 
to the pleasure of the king to slay them, or to retain them in captivity, or to cast them into prison, or to cast them 
out of his land, according to his will and pleasure. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>17:21</b>   And thus Ammon was carried before the king who was over the land of Ishmael; and his name was Lamoni; 
and he was a descendant of Ishmael. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>17:22</b>   And the king inquired of Ammon if it were his desire to dwell in the land among the Lamanites, or 
among his people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>17:23</b>   And Ammon said unto him: Yea, I desire to dwell among this people for a time; yea, and perhaps until 
the day I die. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>17:24</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that king Lamoni was much pleased with Ammon, and caused 
that his bands should be loosed; and he would that Ammon should take one of his daughters to wife. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>17:25</b>   But Ammon said unto him: Nay, but I will be thy servant.   Therefore Ammon became a servant to king 
Lamoni.  <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that he was set among other servants to watch the flocks of Lamoni, 
according to the custom of the Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>17:26</b>   And after he had been in the service of the king three days, as he was with the Lamanitish servants 
going forth with their flocks to the place of water, which was called the water of Sebus, and all the Lamanites drive 
their flocks hither, that they may have water --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>17:27</b>   Therefore, as Ammon and the servants of the king were driving forth their flocks to this place of 
water, behold, a certain number of the Lamanites, who had been with their flocks to water, stood and scattered the 
flocks of Ammon and the servants of the king, and they scattered them insomuch that they fled many ways. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>17:28</b>   Now the servants of the king began to murmur, saying: Now the king will slay us, as he has our 
brethren because their flocks were scattered by the wickedness of these men.  And they began to weep 
<span class="a">exceedingly</span>, saying: Behold, our flocks are scattered already. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>17:29</b>   Now they wept because of the fear of being slain.  Now when Ammon saw this his heart was swollen 
within him with joy; for, said he, I will show forth my power unto these my fellow-servants, or the power which is 
in me, in restoring these flocks unto the king, that I may win the hearts of these my fellow-servants, that I may 
lead them to believe in my words. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>17:30</b>   And now, these were the thoughts of Ammon, when he saw the afflictions of those whom he termed to 
be his brethren. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>17:31</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that he flattered them by his words, saying: My brethren, 
be of good cheer and let us go in search of the flocks, and we will gather them together and bring them back unto the 
place of water; and thus we will preserve the flocks unto the king and he will not slay us. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="32"></a>17:32</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they went in search of the flocks, and they did follow 
Ammon, and they rushed forth with much swiftness and did head the flocks of the king, and did gather them together 
again to the place of water. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="33"></a>17:33</b>   And those men again stood to scatter their flocks; but Ammon said unto his brethren: Encircle the 
flocks round about that they flee not; and I go and contend with these men who do scatter our flocks. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="34"></a>17:34</b>   Therefore, they did as Ammon commanded them, and he went forth and stood to contend with those 
who stood by the waters of Sebus; and they were in number not a few. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="35"></a>17:35</b>   Therefore they did not fear Ammon, for they supposed that one of their men could slay him according to 
their pleasure, for they knew not that the Lord had promised Mosiah that he would deliver his sons out of their hands; 
neither did they know anything concerning the Lord; therefore they delighted in the destruction of their brethren; 
and for this cause they stood to scatter the flocks of the king. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="36"></a>17:36</b>   But <span class="v">Ammon stood forth and began to cast stones at them with his sling; yea, with mighty power he did 
sling stones amongst them; and thus he slew a certain number of them</span> insomuch that they began to be astonished at his 
power; nevertheless they were angry because of the slain of their brethren, and they were determined that he should 
fall; therefore, seeing that they could not hit him with their stones, they came forth with clubs to slay him. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/cr1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1">Ammon killed "a certain number" of people with his sling.</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="37"></a>17:37</b>   But behold, every man that lifted his club to smite Ammon, <span class="v">he 
smote off their arms with his sword; 
for he did withstand their blows by smiting their arms with the edge of his sword,</span> insomuch that they began to be 
astonished, and began to flee before him; yea, and they were not few in number; and he caused them to flee by the 
strength of his arm. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/cr1.gif" width="32" height="32"> (17:37-38)<br>
<i>"Ammon ... smote off their arms with his sword."</i></font>

<tr><td><b><a name="38"></a>17:38</b>   <span class="v">Now six of them had fallen by the sling, but he slew none save it were their leader with his sword; 
and he smote off as many of their arms as were lifted against him, and they were not a few. 
	</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="39"></a>17:39</b>   And when he had driven them afar off, he returned and they watered their flocks and returned them to 
the pasture of the king, <span class="v">and then went in unto the king, bearing the arms which had been smitten off by the sword 
of Ammon</span>, of those who sought to slay him; and they were carried in unto the king for a testimony of the things which 
they had done. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/cr1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1">Ammon carried the arms that he had cut off to show to the king.</font>
