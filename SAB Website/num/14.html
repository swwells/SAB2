<font size="-1">
<img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (14:1-4) When the people heard the spies' reports (see <a href="13.html">last chapter</a>), they believed the giant story and were a bit discouraged. So 
they decided to elect a leader and go back to Egypt.

<p>(14:1) <i>"All the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night."</i>

<p>(14:2) <i>"And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, 
Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!"</i>

<p>(14:3) <i>"Wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should 
be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?"</i>

<p>(14:4) <i>"And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt."</i>

    <p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (14:5-6) When Moses, Aaron, Joshua, and Caleb hear about this, they do what any Bible character would do: 
    they rent their clothes and fall on their faces.
    
    <p>(14:5) <i>"Moses and Aaron fell on their faces." 
    (<a href="../topics/FOF.html" title="And they fell on their faces (FOF)">FOF</a>)</i>
    
    <p>(14:6) <i>"Joshua ... and Caleb ... rent their clothes."</i>
    
    <p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (14:7-9) Then they get up and try to talk the people out of it.
    
    <p>(14:7) <i>"They spake ...saying, The land ... is an exceeding good land."</i>
    
    <p>(14:8) <i>"The LORD ... will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey."</i>
  
    <p>(14:9) <i>"Rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed 
    from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not."</i>
    
    <p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (14:10) 
    But the people weren't buying it. They'd had enough wandering around in the desert and they sure as hell didn't want to fight any damned 
    giants (see <a href="13.html#33">13:33</a>), so they decide to stone Joshua and his merry men (with stones). But before they get 
    started with the stoning, God shows up in all his glory.
    
    <p>(14:10a) <i>"All the congregation bade stone them with stones."</i><br>
    
    <p>(14:10b) <i>"The glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children  of Israel."</i>
    
<p><img src="../images/cr1.gif">
<img src="../images/inj1.gif">
<img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (14:11-12)<br>
God tells Moses that he is going to kill all of the Israelites -- every last whining one of the them, and then make a whole bunch of brand new 
Israelites.

<p>(14:11-12) <i>"The LORD said unto Moses ... I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater
    nation and mightier than they."</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif">
(14:13-16) But Moses talks him out of of it (like he did in <a href="../ex/32.html#11">Exodus 32:11-12</a>), saying that 
the Egyptians will hear about it and will say that he wasn't able to lead the Israelites to Israel, so he killed them all instead. 
How would <i>that</i> look to the neighbors?
    
<p>(14:13) <i>"And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it,"</i>

<p><img src="../images/contra1.gif"> (14:14) <i>"Thou LORD art seen face to face."</i><br>
<A href="../contra/seen.html">Can God be seen?</a>

<p>(14:15) <i>"If thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,"</i> 
    
<p>(14:16) <i>"Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain 
them in the wilderness."</i>
    
<p><img src="../images/inj1.gif">
<img src="../images/cr1.gif">
<img src="../images/fv.gif">
<img src="../images/contra1.gif"> (14:18)<br>
<i>"The LORD is longsuffering, and of great mercy ... visiting the iniquity of the 
fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation."</i><br>
How is punishing children for the sins of their great-great grandfathers merciful?</br>
<A href="../contra/iniquity.html">Are we punished for the sins of others?</a>    

<p><img src="../images/inj1.gif">
<img src="../images/cr1.gif">
<img src="../images/int.gif"> (14:20-35)<br>
So Moses talked God out of killing everyone. Instead, he'll just make sure that no one over 20 years old survives the trip to Israel. 
Their "carcases shall fall in the wilderness."

<p>(14:20) <i>"And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word."</i>

<p>(14:29) <i>"Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness ... from twenty years old and 
upward which have murmured against me."</i>

<p>(14:32) <i>"But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness."</i>
