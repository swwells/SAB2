"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",
"<span class='a'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges ... even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year....</span>--<a href='16.html#1'>Alma 16:1</a>",
"<span class='a'>Their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.</span>--<a href='16.html#11'>Alma 16:11</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",

"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",

"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",

"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",
"<span class='i'>These dissenters ... became ... more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='47.html#36'>Alma 47:36</a>",

"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",
"<span class='i'>The remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty.</span>--<a href='51.html#20'>Alma 51:20</a>",
"<span class='g'>And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye.</span>--<a href='54.html#21'>Alma 54:21</a>",

<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>9:1</b>   And again, I, Alma, having been commanded of God that I should take Amulek and go 
forth and preach again unto this people, or the people who were in the city of Ammonihah, <span class="a">it came to 
pass</span> as I began to preach unto them, they began to contend with me, saying: <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a> (9:1, 31, 33, 34)
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>9:2</b>   Who art thou?  Suppose ye that we shall believe the testimony of one man, although he 
should preach unto us that the earth should pass away? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>9:3</b>   Now they understood not the words which they spake; for they knew not that the earth 
should pass away. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>9:4</b>   And they said also: We will not believe thy words if thou shouldst prophesy that 
this great city should be destroyed in one day. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>9:5</b>   Now they knew not that God could do such marvelous works, for they were a hard-hearted 
and a stiffnecked people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>9:6</b>   And they said: Who is God, that sendeth no more authority than one man among this 
people, to declare unto them the truth of such great and marvelous things? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>9:7</b>   And they stood forth to lay their hands on me; but behold, they did not.  And I 
stood with boldness to declare unto them, yea, I did boldly testify unto them, saying: <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>9:8</b>   Behold, O ye wicked and perverse generation, how have ye forgotten the tradition 
of your fathers; yea, how soon ye have forgotten the commandments of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>9:9</b>   Do ye not remember that our father, Lehi, was brought out of Jerusalem by the 
hand of God?  Do ye not remember that they were all led by him through the wilderness? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>9:10</b>   And have ye forgotten so soon how many times he delivered our fathers out of the 
hands of their enemies, and preserved them from being destroyed, even by the hands of their own brethren? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>9:11</b>   Yea, and if it had not been for his matchless power, and his mercy, and his 
long-suffering towards us, we should unavoidably have been cut off from the face of the earth long before this 
period of time, and perhaps been consigned to a state of endless misery and woe. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>9:12</b>   Behold, now I say unto you that he commandeth you to repent; and except ye 
repent, ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God.  But behold, this is not all -- he has commanded you to <span class="i">repent, 
or he will utterly destroy you from off the face of the earth; yea, he will visit you in his anger, and in his 
fierce anger he will not turn away.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/inj1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<img src="../../images/cr1.gif" width="32" height="32">
God will destroy those who don't repent.
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>9:13</b>   Behold, do ye not remember the words which he spake unto Lehi, saying that: 
Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper in the land?  And again it is said that: Inasmuch as 
ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>9:14</b>   Now I would that ye should remember, that inasmuch as the Lamanites have not 
kept the commandments of God, they have been cut off from the presence of the Lord.  Now we see that the word of 
the Lord has been verified in this thing, and the Lamanites have been cut off from his presence, from the beginning 
of their transgressions in the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>9:15</b>   Nevertheless I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for them in the 
day of judgment than for you, if ye remain in your sins, yea, and even more tolerable for them in this life than 
for you, except ye repent. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>9:16</b>   For there are many promises which are extended to the Lamanites; for it is 
because of the traditions of their fathers that caused them to remain in their state of ignorance; therefore the 
Lord will be merciful unto them and prolong their existence in the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>9:17</b>   And at some period of time they will be brought to believe in his word, and to 
know of the incorrectness of the traditions of their fathers; and many of them will be saved, for the Lord will be 
merciful unto all who call on his name. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>9:18</b>   But behold, I say unto you that if ye persist in your wickedness that your 
days shall not be prolonged in the land, for <span class="i">the Lamanites shall be sent upon you; and if ye repent not they shall 
come in a time when you know not, and ye shall be visited with utter destruction; and it shall be according to the 
fierce anger of the Lord.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/inj1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1">If the Nephites don't repent, God will send the Lamanites to destroy them.</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>9:19</b>   For he will not suffer you that ye shall live in your iniquities, to destroy 
his people.  I say unto you, Nay; <span class="i">he would rather suffer that the Lamanites might destroy all his people</span> 
who are called the people of Nephi, if it were possible that they could fall into sins and transgressions, after having had 
so much light and so much knowledge given unto them of the Lord their God; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>9:20</b>   Yea, after having been <span class="i">such a highly favored people of the Lord; yea, after 
having been favored above</span><span class="plag"> every other nation, kindred, tongue, or people</span>; after having had all things made known 
unto them, according to their desires, and their faith, and prayers, of that which has been, and which is, and 
which is to come; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>9:21</b>   Having been visited by the Spirit of God; having conversed with angels, and 
having been spoken unto by the voice of the Lord; and having the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, 
and also many gifts, the gift of speaking with tongues, and the gift of preaching, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, 
and the gift of translation; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>9:22</b>   Yea, and after having been delivered of God out of the land of Jerusalem, by 
the hand of the Lord; having been saved from famine, and from sickness, and all manner of diseases of every kind; 
and they having waxed strong in battle, that they might not be destroyed; having been brought out of bondage time 
after time, and having been kept and preserved until now; and they have been prospered until they are rich in all 
manner of things --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>9:23</b>   And now behold I say unto you, that if this people, who have received so 
many blessings from the hand of the Lord, should transgress contrary to the light and knowledge which they do 
have, I say unto you that if this be the case, that if they should fall into transgression, it would be far more 
tolerable for the Lamanites than for them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>9:24</b>   For behold, the promises of the Lord are extended to the Lamanites, but they 
are not unto you if ye transgress; for has not the Lord expressly promised and firmly decreed, that if ye will rebel 
against him that ye shall utterly be destroyed from off the face of the earth? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>9:25</b>   And now for this cause, that ye may not be destroyed, the Lord has sent his angel to visit 
many of his people, declaring unto them that they must go forth and cry mightily unto this people, saying: <span class="plag">Repent ye, 
for the kingdom of heaven is nigh at hand;</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>9:28</b>   Therefore, prepare ye the way of the Lord, for the time is at hand that all 
men shall reap a reward of their works, according to that which they have been -- if they have been righteous they 
shall reap the salvation of their souls, according to the power and deliverance of Jesus Christ; and if they have 
been evil they shall reap the damnation of their souls, according to the power and captivation of the devil. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>9:29</b>   Now behold, this is the voice of the angel, crying unto the people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>9:30</b>   And now, my beloved brethren, for ye are my brethren, and ye ought to be 
beloved, and ye ought to <span class="plag">bring forth works which are meet for repentance</span>, seeing that your hearts have been grossly 
hardened against the word of God, and seeing that ye are a lost and a fallen people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

were wroth with me because I said unto them that they were a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="32"></a>9:32</b>   And also because I said unto them that they were a lost and a fallen people they 
were angry with me, and sought to lay their hands upon me, that they might cast me into prison. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
