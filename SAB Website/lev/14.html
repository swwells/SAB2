(14:2-52) God's law for lepers: Get two birds.
Kill one. Dip the live bird in the blood of the dead one. Sprinkle the blood on
the leper seven times, and then let the blood-soaked bird fly away. Next find a
lamb and kill it. Wipe some of its blood on the patient's right ear, thumb, and
big toe. Sprinkle seven times with oil and wipe some of the oil on his right
ear, thumb and big toe. Repeat. Finally find another pair of birds. Kill one and dip 
the live bird in the dead bird's blood. Wipe some blood on the patient's right ear, thumb, 
and big toe. Sprinkle the house with blood 7 times. That's all there is to it.

<p>(14:2) <i>"This shall be the law of the leper."</i>

<p>(14:4) <i>"Then shall the priest ... take ... two birds alive and clean."</i>

    pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose."</i>
