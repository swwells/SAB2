<p><li>If you do what other people want, you’re not a good Christian. <a href="1.html#10">1:10</a>

<p><li>Jesus was cursed by God. <a href="3.html#13">3:13</a>

<p><li>"Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am." Forget Jesus. Be like Paul. <a href="4.html#12">4:12</a>

 <p><li>"If ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing."<br> 
(You can’t be saved if you’re circumcised?) <a href="5.html#2">5:2</a>

<p><li>"I would they were even cut off which trouble you." Gosh, that doesn't sound very nice. But I wonder what Paul
meant by "cut off". The New Revised Standard Version translates this verse as: "I wish those who unsettle you would
castrate themselves!"  <a href="5.html#12">5:12</a>

<p><li>"See how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand."<br>
  Paul was proud of his large handwriting. <a href="6.html#11">6:11</a>    
 
<p><li>"Many ... desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh." Seems like a strange thing to glory in. But OK.
