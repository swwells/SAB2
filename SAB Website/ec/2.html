  I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine

    of their life.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of
    fruits:<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth

  I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I

  I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and
