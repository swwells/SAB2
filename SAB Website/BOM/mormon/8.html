which things I have been commanded by my father. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>8:2</b> <span class="a">And now it came to pass</span> that after the great and tremendous battle at Cumorah, behold, the Nephites

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>8:3</b>   And my father also was killed by them, and I even remain alone to write the sad tale of the 
destruction of my people.  But behold, they are gone, and I fulfil the commandment of my father. And whether they will slay me, 
I know not. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>8:4</b>   Therefore I will write and hide up the records in the earth; and whither I go it mattereth not. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>8:5</b>   Behold, my father hath made this record, and he hath written the intent thereof.  And behold, I 
would write it also if I had room upon the plates, but I have not; and ore I have none, for I am alone.  My father 
hath been slain in battle, and all my kinsfolk, and I have not friends nor whither to go; and how long the Lord 
will suffer that I may live I know not. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>8:6</b>   Behold, four hundred years have passed away since the coming of our Lord and Savior. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>8:7</b>   And behold, the Lamanites have hunted my people, the Nephites, down from city to city and from place 
to place, even until they are no more; and great has been their fall; yea, great and marvelous is the destruction 
of my people, the Nephites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>8:8</b>   And behold, it is the hand of the Lord which hath done it.   And behold also, the Lamanites are 
at war one with another; and the whole face of this land is one continual round of murder and bloodshed; and no 
one knoweth the end of the war. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>8:9</b>   And now, behold, I say no more concerning them, for there are none save it be the Lamanites and robbers 
that do exist upon the face of the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>8:10</b>   And there are none that do know the true God save it be the disciples of Jesus, who did tarry in the 
land until the wickedness of the people was so great that the Lord would not suffer them to remain with the people; and 
whether they be upon the face of the land no man knoweth. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>8:11</b>   But behold, my father and I have seen them, and they have ministered unto us. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>8:12</b>   And whoso receiveth this record, and shall not condemn it because of the imperfections which are in it, 
the same shall know of greater things than these.  Behold, I am Moroni; and were it possible, I would make all things known 
unto you. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>8:13</b>   Behold, I make an end of speaking concerning this people.  I am the son of Mormon, and my father was a 
descendant of Nephi. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>8:14</b>   And I am the same who hideth up this record unto the Lord; the plates thereof are of no worth, because of 
the commandment of the Lord.  For he truly saith that no one shall have them to get gain; but the record thereof is of great 
worth; and whoso shall bring it to light, him will the Lord bless. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>8:15</b>   For none can have power to bring it to light save it be given him of God; for God wills that it shall be 
done with an eye single to his glory, or the welfare of the ancient and long dispersed covenant people of the Lord. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
