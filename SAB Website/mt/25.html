The kingdom of heaven like ten virgins who went to 
meet their bridegroom. Five had oil for their lamps and five didn't. When the bridegroom was ready for them, only the five well-oiled virgins 
got to have sex with him on their wedding night. He shunned the other five, saying "Get lost, ladies. I don't even know you." The moral to the story is 
this: watch out, you never know when (or with whom) Jesus  will come.<br>

    The kingdom of heaven is like a rich man who distributed his wealth to his servants while he 
	traveled. He gave five <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_talents#Interpretations">talents</a> 
	(a talent was a unit of money, worth about 20 years of a worker's wages) to one servant, two to another, and one to a third. When he returned, 
	the servant with five talents had made five more, the servant with two made two more, but the 
	servant with one talent only had the talent his master entrusted to him. The master rewarded the servants that invested 
	his money (without his permission -- what would have happened if the stock market went down during their master's travels?) and 
	took the talent from the single-talent servant and gave it to the one with ten talents. "For unto every one that hath shall be given 	
	.. but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath." Then the cruel and unjust master cast the servant who 
	carefully protected his master's talent into the "outer darkness: [where] there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."

<p>(25:14) <i>"The kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling ... who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods."

<p>(25:15) <i>"Unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one."</i>

<p>(25:16-18) <i>"He that had received the five talents ... made ... five talents. 
He that had received two ... gained other two. But he that had received one ... hid his lord's money."</i>

<p>(25:19) <i>"After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them."</i>

<p>(25:20-21) <i>"He that had received five talents ... [said] I have gained ... five talents more. 
His lord said ... Well done ... enter thou into the joy of thy lord."</i>

<p>(25:22-23) <i>"He ... that had received two talents ... said ... I have gained two other talents. 
His lord said unto him, Well done ... enter thou into the joy of thy lord."</i>

<p>(25:24-25) <i>"Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord  ... 
there thou hast that is thine."</i>

<p>(25:26-28) <i>"His lord ... said  ... Thou wicked and slothful servant ... Take therefore the talent from him, 
and give it unto him which hath ten."</i>
