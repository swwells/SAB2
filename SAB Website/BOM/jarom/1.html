<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>1</b>   Now behold, I, Jarom, write a few words according to the commandment of my father, Enos, that our 
genealogy may be kept. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>2</b>   And as these plates are small, and as these things are written for the intent of the benefit of our 
brethren the Lamanites, wherefore, it must needs be that I write a little; but I shall not write the things of my 
prophesying, nor of my revelations.   For what could I write more than my fathers have written?  For have not they 
revealed the plan of salvation?  I say unto you, Yea; and this sufficeth me. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>3</b>   Behold, it is expedient that much should be done among this people, because of the hardness of their 
hearts, and the deafness of their ears, and the blindness of their minds, and the stiffness of their necks; 
nevertheless, God is <span class="a">exceedingly</span> merciful unto them, and has not as yet swept them off from the face of the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>4</b>   And there are many among us who have many revelations, for they are not all stiffnecked.  And as many as 
are not stiffnecked and have faith, have communion with the Holy Spirit, which maketh manifest unto the children of men, 
according to their faith. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>5</b>   And now, behold, two hundred years had passed away, and the people of Nephi had waxed strong in the 
land.  They observed to keep the law of Moses and the sabbath day holy unto the Lord.   And they profaned not; neither 
did they blaspheme.  And the laws of the land were <span class="a">exceedingly</span> strict. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>6</b>   And they were scattered upon much of the face of the land, and <span class="i">the Lamanites</span> also.  And they were 
<span class="a">exceedingly</span> more numerous than were they of the Nephites; and they <span class="i">loved murder and would drink the blood 
of beasts.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>7</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they came many times against us, <span class="sci">the Nephites</span>, to battle.  But our kings and 
our leaders were mighty men in the faith of the Lord; and they taught the people the ways of the Lord; wherefore, we 
withstood the Lamanites and swept them away out of our lands, and <span class="sci">began to fortify our cities</span>, or whatsoever place of 
our inheritance. <td bgcolor="eeeeee" rowspan="3">

The Nephites "multplied exceedingly" and "became exceedingly rich" in gold, silver, iron, copper, brass, 
and steel making tools and weapons "of every kind." This was before steel existed, of course, and no evidence for any of 
these Nephite weapons, tools, cities, or technologies have ever been found.

war -- yea, the sharp pointed arrow, and the quiver, and the dart, and the javelin, and all preparations for war.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>9</b>   And thus being prepared to meet the Lamanites, they did not prosper against us.  But the word of the Lord 
was verified, which he spake unto our fathers, saying that: Inasmuch as ye will keep my commandments ye shall prosper in 
the land. 

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>10</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the prophets of the Lord did threaten the people of Nephi, according to the 
word of God, that if they did not keep the commandments, but should fall into transgression, they should be destroyed 
from off the face of the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>11</b>   Wherefore, the prophets, and the priests, and the teachers, did labor diligently, exhorting with all 
long-suffering the people to diligence; teaching the law of Moses, and the intent for which it was given; persuading 
them to look forward unto the Messiah, and believe in him to come as though he already was.   And after this manner 
did they teach them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>12</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that by so doing they kept them from being destroyed upon the face of the land; 
for they did prick their hearts with the word, continually stirring them up unto repentance. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>13</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that two hundred and thirty and eight years had passed away -- after the manner of 
wars, and contentions, and dissensions, for the space of much of the time. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>14</b>   And I, Jarom, do not write more, for the plates are small.   But behold, my brethren, ye can go to the 
other plates of Nephi; for behold, upon them the records of our wars are engraven, according to the writings of the 
kings, or those which they caused to be written. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>15</b>   And I deliver these plates into the hands of my son Omni, that they may be kept according to the 
commandments of my fathers. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
