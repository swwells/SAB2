<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>9:1</b>   I, Zeniff, having been taught in all the language of the Nephites, and having had a knowledge of the 
land of Nephi, or of the land of our fathers' first inheritance, and having been sent as a spy among the Lamanites that 
I might spy out their forces, that our army might come upon them and destroy them -- but when I saw that which was good 
among them I was desirous that they should not be destroyed. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>9:2</b>   Therefore, I contended with my brethren in the wilderness for I would that our ruler should make a 
treaty with them; but he being an austere and a bloodthirsty man commanded that I should be slain; but I was rescued 
by the shedding of much blood; for father fought against father, and brother against brother, until the greater number 
of our army was destroyed in the wilderness; and we returned, those of us that were spared, to the land of Zarahemla, 
to relate that tale to their wives and their children. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>9:3</b>   And yet, I being over-zealous to inherit the land of our fathers, collected as many as were desirous to 
go up to possess the land, and started again on our journey into the wilderness to go up to the land; but we were smitten 
with famine and sore afflictions; for we were slow to remember the Lord our God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>9:4</b>   Nevertheless, after many days' wandering in the wilderness we pitched our tents in the place where our 
brethren were slain, which was near to the land of our fathers. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>9:5</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that I went again with four of my men into the city, in unto 
the king, that I might know of the disposition of the king, and that I might know if I might go in with my people and 
possess the land in peace. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a> (9:5, 11, 13, 15, 16)
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>9:6</b>   And I went in unto the king, and he covenanted with me that I might possess the land of Lehi-Nephi, and 
the land of Shilom. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>9:7</b>   And he also commanded that his people should depart out of the land, and I and my people went into the 
land that we might possess it. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>9:8</b>   And we began to build buildings, and to repair the walls of the city, yea, even the walls of the city 
of Lehi-Nephi, and the city of Shilom. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>9:9</b>   And <span class="sci">we began to till the ground, yea, even with all manner of 
seeds</span>, with seeds of corn, and <span class="sci">of wheat, 
and of barley</span>, and with neas, and with sheum, and with seeds of all manner of fruits; and we did begin to multiply and

<font size="-1">Zeniff and his people plant all kinds of crops, including wheat and barley, neither of which were present

</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>9:10</b>   Now it was the cunning and the craftiness of king Laman, to bring my people into bondage, that he 
yielded up the land that we might possess it. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>9:11</b>   Therefore <span class="a">it came to pass</span>, that after we had dwelt in the land for the space of twelve years that king 
Laman began to grow uneasy, lest by any means my people should wax strong in the land, and that they could not overpower 
them and bring them into bondage. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>9:12</b>   Now they were a lazy and an idolatrous people; therefore they were desirous to bring us into bondage, 
that they might glut themselves with the labors of our hands; yea, that they might feast themselves upon the flocks of 
our fields. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>9:13</b>   Therefore <span class="a">it came to pass</span> that king Laman began to stir up his people that they should contend with my 
people; therefore there began to be wars and contentions in the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>9:14</b>   For, in the thirteenth year of my reign in the land of Nephi, away on the south of the land of Shilom, 
when my people were watering and feeding their flocks, and tilling their lands, a numerous host of Lamanites came upon 
them and began to slay them, and to take off their flocks, and the corn of their fields. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>9:15</b>   Yea, <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they fled, all that were not overtaken, 
even into the city of Nephi, and did call upon me for protection. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>9:16</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that I did arm them with bows, and with 
arrows, with <span class="sci">swords, and with cimeters</span>, and with clubs, and with slings, and with all manner of weapons which we could invent, and I and my 
people did go forth against the Lamanites to battle. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">Zeniff arms his people with swords and cimeters. No evidence for these pre-Columbian weapons 
has ever been found. <br>
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>9:17</b>   Yea, in the strength of the Lord did we go forth to battle against the Lamanites; for I and my people 
did cry mightily to the Lord that he would deliver us out of the hands of our enemies, for we were awakened to a 
remembrance of the deliverance of our fathers. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>9:18</b>   And <span class="v">God did hear our cries and did answer our prayers; and we did go forth in his might; yea, we did 
go forth against the Lamanites, and in one day and a night we did slay three thousand and forty-three</span>; we did slay them 
even until we had driven them out of our land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
