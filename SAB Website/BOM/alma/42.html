"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",

which <span class="a">ye cannot understand -- which is concerning the justice of God in the punishment of the sinner; for ye do try to suppose 
that it is injustice that the sinner should be consigned to a state of misery. </span><td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">Alma tries (and fails) to explain how it is just for God to torment perople forever in hell.</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>42:2</b>   Now behold, my son, I will explain this thing unto thee.  For behold, after 
<span class="plag">the Lord God sent our first parents forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground, from whence 
they were taken -- yea, he drew out the man, and he placed at the east end of the garden of Eden, cherubim, and 
a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the tree of life</span> --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1"><img src="../../images/plag.gif" border="0" width="32" height="32">
Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned 
every way, to keep the way of the tree of life. -- <a href="../../gen/3.html#23">Genesis 3:23-24</a>
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>42:3</b>   Now, we see that the man had become as God, knowing good and evil; and lest he should put forth 
his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat and live forever, the Lord God placed cherubim and the 
flaming sword, that he should not partake of the fruit --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>42:4</b>   And thus we see, that there was a time granted unto man to repent, yea, a probationary time, a 
time to repent and serve God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>42:5</b>   For behold, if Adam had put forth his hand immediately, and partaken of the tree of life, he 
would have lived forever, according to the word of God, having no space for repentance; yea, and also the word 
of God would have been void, and the great plan of salvation would have been frustrated. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>42:6</b>   But behold, <span class="plag">it was appointed unto man to die</span> -- therefore, as they were cut off from the tree of 
life they should be cut off from the face of the earth -- and man became lost forever, yea, they became fallen man. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/plag.gif" border="0" width="32" height="32">
And as it is appointed unto men once to die -- <a href="../../heb/9.html#27">Hebrews 9:27</a>
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>42:7</b>   And now, ye see by this that our first parents were cut off both temporally and spiritually from the 
presence of the Lord; and thus we see they became subjects to follow after their own will. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>42:8</b>   Now behold, it was not expedient that man should be reclaimed from this temporal death, for that 
would destroy the great plan of happiness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>42:9</b>   Therefore, as the soul could never die, and the fall had brought upon all mankind a spiritual 
death as well as a temporal, that is, they were cut off from the presence of the Lord, it was expedient that 
mankind should be reclaimed from this spiritual death. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>42:10</b>   Therefore, as they had become carnal, sensual, and devilish, by nature, this probationary state 
became a state for them to prepare; it became a preparatory state. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>42:11</b>   And now remember, my son, if it were not for the plan of redemption, (laying it aside) as soon 
as they were dead their souls were miserable, being cut off from the presence of the Lord. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>42:12</b>   And now, there was no means to reclaim men from this fallen state, which man had brought upon 
himself because of his own disobedience; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>42:13</b>   Therefore, according to justice, the plan of redemption could not be brought about, only on 
conditions of repentance of men in this probationary state, yea, this preparatory state; for except it were for 
these conditions, mercy could not take effect except it should destroy the work of justice.  Now the work of 
justice could not be destroyed; if so, God would cease to be God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>42:14</b>   And thus we see that all mankind were fallen, and they were in the grasp of justice; yea, the 
justice of God, which consigned them forever to be cut off from his presence. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>42:15</b>   And now, the plan of mercy could not be brought about except an atonement should be made; 
therefore God himself atoneth for the sins of the world, to bring about the plan of mercy, to appease the 
demands of justice, that God might be a perfect, just God, and a merciful God also. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>42:16</b>   Now, repentance could not come unto men except there were a punishment, which also was eternal 
as the life of the soul should be, affixed opposite to the plan of happiness, which was as eternal also as the 
life of the soul. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>42:17</b>   Now, how could a man repent except he should sin?  How could he sin if there was no law?  How 
could there be a law save there was a punishment? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>42:18</b>   Now, there was a punishment affixed, and a just law given, which brought remorse of conscience 
unto man. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>42:19</b>   Now, if there was no law given -- if a man murdered he should die -- would he be 
afraid he would die if he should murder? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>42:20</b>   And also, if there was no law given against sin men would not be afraid to sin. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>42:21</b>   And if there was no law given, if men sinned what could justice do, or mercy either, for they 
would have no claim upon the creature? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>42:22</b>   But there is a law given, and a punishment affixed, and a repentance granted; which repentance 
mercy claimeth; otherwise, justice claimeth the creature and executeth the law, and the law inflicteth the 
punishment; if not so, the works of justice would be destroyed, and God would cease to be God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>42:23</b>   But God ceaseth not to be God, and mercy claimeth the penitent, and mercy cometh because of the 
atonement; and the atonement bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead; and the resurrection of the dead bringeth 
back men into the presence of God; and thus they are restored into his presence, to be judged according to their 
works, according to the law and justice. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>42:24</b>   For behold, justice exerciseth all his demands, and also mercy claimeth all which is her own; 
and thus, none but the truly penitent are saved. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>42:25</b>   What, do ye suppose that mercy can rob justice?  I say unto you, Nay; not one whit.  If so, God 
would cease to be God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>42:26</b>   And thus God bringeth about his great and eternal purposes, which were prepared from the 
foundation of the world.  And thus cometh about the salvation and the redemption of men, and also their 
destruction and misery. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>42:27</b>   Therefore, O my son, <span class="plag">whosoever will come may come and partake 
of the waters of life freely</span>; 
and whosoever will not come the same is not compelled to come; but in the last day it shall be restored unto 
him according to his deeds. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/plag.gif" border="0" width="32" height="32">
Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. -- <a href="../../rev/22.html#17">Revelation 22:17</a>
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>42:28</b>   If he has desired to do evil, and has not repented in his days, behold, evil shall be done 
unto him, according to the restoration of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>42:29</b>   And now, my son, I desire that ye should let these things trouble you no more, and only let your 
sins trouble you, with that trouble which shall bring you down unto repentance. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>42:30</b>   O my son, I desire that ye should deny the justice of God no more.  Do not endeavor to excuse 
yourself in the least point because of your sins, by denying the justice of God; but do you let the justice of 
God, and his mercy, and his long-suffering have full sway in your heart; and let it bring you down to the dust 
in humility. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>42:31</b>   And now, O my son, ye are called of God to preach the word unto this people.  And now, my 
son, go thy way, declare the word with truth and soberness, that thou mayest bring souls unto repentance, 
that the great plan of mercy may have claim upon them.  And may God grant unto you even according to my words.   
Amen. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
