<p><li> God "corrects" people by killing their children.  <a href="2.html#30">2:30</a>

<p><li> Circumcise the foreskin of your heart or God will burn you to death. <a href="4.html#4">4:4</a>

<p><li>God will bring evil to entire cities, destroying them and wipe out all of their 
inhabitants. <a href="4.html#6">4:6-7</a>

<p><li> God sends plagues and violence to correct people.  <a href="5.html#3">5:3</a>

<p><li> God will send lions and leopards to tear people into little bitty pieces.
<a href="5.html#6">5:6</a>

<p><li>God will kill those who believe and preach the wrong doctrines. <a href="5.html#12">5:12-13</a>

<p><li> &quot;I am full of the fury of the Lord; I am weary of holding it in.&quot; He's anxious 
to &quot;pour it out&quot; on children, young men, husbands, wives, and old people.  
<a href="6.html#11">6:11-12</a>

<p><li>God threatens to punish the men by taking away
all of their property, including their wives, and giving them to others. <a href="6.html#12">6:12</a>

<p><li> God will kill pretty much everyone: fathers and sons, 
family, friends, and neighbors. God plans to kill them all after laying a stumbling block before them.
 <a href="6.html#21">6:21</a>
 
<p><li>God will send soldiers from the north that will kill everyone and 
have no mercy. <a href="6.html#22">6:22-23</a>

<p><li> God will pour out his anger on both man and beast. Not even the trees will 
be spared from his wrath. And the ground itself will burn forever.  <a href="7.html#20">7:20</a>

<p><li> God will feed the people to the birds and the beasts, &quot;and none shall fray 
them away.&quot;&nbsp;  <a href="7.html#33">7:33</a>

<p><li> God will cover the earth with dead bodies that will not be buried. &quot;They shall be for dung 
upon the face of the earth.&quot;  <a href="8.html#2">8:2</a>

<p><li> People will choose to kill themselves, rather than be killed by their vicious 
God.  <a href="8.html#3">8:3</a>

<p><li> God will give the people bad food and water, and then kill them with a 
sword. <a href="9.html#15">9:15-16</a>

<p><li> God will kill children and young men, and the dead bodies "shall fall as dung .... and none shall 
gather them."  <a href="9.html#21">9:21-22</a>

<p><li> "Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all them which are circumcised with the 
uncircumcised."  I guess that'd include just about everyone -- well, all the men 
anyway.  <a href="9.html#25">9:25-26</a>

<p><li> Jeremiah prays for the destruction of people and families that don't call on God's name. 
<a href="10.html#25">10:25</a>

<p><li> God &quot;will bring evil upon&quot; people from which they will not be able to escape. And if they 
cry out to him for help, he will not help them.  <a href="11.html#11">11:11</a>

<p><li> God forbids others from praying for his victims. Such prayers would go unanswered anyway, he says,

<a href="12.html#3">12:3</a>

<p><li>God delivered his people "into the hand of her enemies." He "hates" his "dearly 
beloved" people and plans to feed them to the birds. <a href="12.html#7">12:7-9</a>

<p><li> God's sword will &quot;devour&quot; everyone until &quot;no flesh shall have 
peace.&quot;  <a href="12.html#12">12:12</a>

nation." <a href="12.html#17">12:17</a>

<p><li> God plans to make everyone in the kingdom drunk and then &quot;dash the fathers and the sons 
together.&quot; The merciful God of Peace vows to &quot;not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy 
them.&quot;  <a href="13.html#13">13:13-14</a>

themselves.  <a href="14.html#15">14:15-16</a>

<p><li> God plans to do four things to his people: 1) kill them with swords, 2) tear their flesh with dogs, 3) have the birds, and 4) the beasts eat their bodies. Why will he do these terrible things? Because of
something some former king did.  <a href="15.html#2">15:2-4</a>

<p><li> God again threatens Jerusalem with mass destruction.  Here are some of the highlights: 
He will kill children, make more widows than there are grains of 
sand, terrorize cities, and then kill the survivors. <a href="15.html#7">15:7-9</a>

<p><li> God will have you enslaved and, if you make him mad enough, he will burn you to 
death. <a href="15.html#14">15:14</a>

<p><li> God tells Jeremiah not to get married or have children, because he's 
going to kill everyone (mothers and daughters, fathers and sons). They all &quot;shall die of grievous 
deaths,&quot; and that shall neither &quot;be lamented&quot; nor buried, but &quot;shall 
be as dung upon the face of the earth.&quot;  For he has removed peace, "lovingkindness," and mercy 
from the people.  <a href="16.html#1">16:1-7</a>

<p><li> God will kill children if their parents worship other gods. <a href="16.html#10">16:10-11</a>

friend." <a href="19.html#7">19:7-9</a>

<p><li>God will break those who worship other gods as though they were made of clay, killing 
so many that there will not be enough room to bury them all. <a href="19.html#11">19:11-13</a>

<p><li>"For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and
    to all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and
    thine eyes shall behold it." <a href="20.html#4">20:4</a>
    
<p><li> God himself will fight and kill everyone in fury "with an outstretched hand and 
with a strong arm."  <a href="21.html#5">21:5</a>

<p><li>"I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great
    pestilence." <a href="21.html#6">21:6</a>
    
<p><li> God will deliver Zedekiah and those that survive the famine, disease, and war into Nebuchadrezzar's hand, and &quot;he shall smite them 
with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy.  <a href="21.html#7">21:7</a>

<p><li> God promises to kill everyone by war, starvation, and disease.  <a href="24.html#10">24:10</a>

drunken&quot;. Then he'll kill "all the inhabitants of the earth" with a sword.  
<a href="25.html#26">25:26-29</a>

<p><li> God will kill so many people that the entire earth will be covered with their dead bodies. No one is to 
mourn them or even bury them; &quot;they shall be dung upon the ground.&quot;  <a href="25.html#31">25:31-33</a>

<p><li>God will destroy "the peaceable habitations" and make the land desolate "because of his fierce anger." 
<a href="25.html#37">25:37-38</a>

with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand."  <a href="27.html#8">27:8</a>

<p><li>God kills Hananiah for prophesying falsely. <a href="28.html#15">28:15-17</a>

<p><li> God will send his usual blessings upon his people: &quot;the sword, the famine, and the 
pestilence.&quot; He &quot;will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so 
evil.&quot;  <a href="29.html#17">29:17-18</a>

<p><li>God will kill those who refuse listen to his prophets. <a href="29.html#19">29:19</a>

<p><li> God will deliver Ahab and Zedekiah into the hands of Nebuchadrezzar &quot;and he shall slay them 
before your eyes&quot; and Ahab will be "roasted 
in the fire."  <a href="29.html#21">29:21-22</a>

<p><li> When God pours forth his fury and his anger, entire cities are destroyed. <a href="44.html#6">44:6</a>

<p><li> "I will watch over them for evil, and not for good."  <a href="44.html#27">44:27</a>
