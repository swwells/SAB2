<p><li>"I beheld a virgin, and whe was exceedingly fair and white."<br>
Nephi sees an exceedingly white virgin. But how the hell would Nephi know that the exceedingly white woman was 
a virgin? I guess Nephi could spot a virgin from 400 kilometers away. <a href="11.html#13">11:13</a>
 
<p><li>Nephi, his brothers, and Zoram (Laban's servant) all got married to Ishmael's nameless daughters. It was a group wedding 
   with Lehi serving as the Reverend Moon, saying stuff like, "Do you [Nephi, Laman, Lemuel, Sam, Zoram] take what's her name here 
   to be your lawfully wedded wife?" <a href="16.html#7">16:7</a>

<p><li>They waded through much affliction and their nameless women bore children in the wilderness. <a href="17.html#1">17:1b</a>
