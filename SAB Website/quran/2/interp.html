<p><li><a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/004.smt.html#004.1707">Muhammad said</a> that Satan runs away 
from any house in which this surah is recited. <a href="index.htm">2</a>

<p><li>"Alif. Lam. Mim."<br>

<p><li>"Beautified is the life of the world for those who disbelieve; 
they make a jest of the believers."<br>
Yes life is beautiful to us unbelievers and we like to laugh at believers! <a href="index.htm#212">2:212</a>
