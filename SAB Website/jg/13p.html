    It starts out in the usual way, with the children of Israel doing evil in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord 
    doing what he always does in such cases: he sells them. (Except that in this case he "delivered" them to the 
    Philistines for forty years, so maybe the Israelites were a gift and he didn't get paid for them.)
    
    <p>(13:1) <i>"The children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years."</i>
    
    <p><IMG src="../images/wom1.gif">
    <IMG src="../images/abs1.gif"> (13:3) After giving, selling, or renting the Israelites to the Philistines, God needed to find someone to help 
    kill the Israelites' new owners. And that's where Sampson comes in.
    
    <p>Sampson's birth was a lot like Jesus'. An angel visited his mom to announce that she was going to have a son.
    
    <p> (13:3) <i>"The angel of the LORD appeared ... and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son."</i>
      Manoah's nameless wife, like so many biblical women, is barren. But an angel (or "a man of God") fixes that, and Samson is born.
    
     <p><img src="../images/interp.gif"> (13:4, 7) <i>"Drink not wine nor strong drink."</i><br>
    <a href="../contra/alcohol.html">Is it OK to drink alcohol?</a>
    
    <p><IMG src="../images/contra1.gif"> (13:5a) <i>"No razor shall come on his head."</i><br>
    <a href="../contra/hair.html">Is it OK for men to have long hair?</a>
    
    <p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (13:5b) <i>"The child shall be a Nazarite from the womb."</i><br>
    According to <a href="../num/6.html#6">Numbers 6:6</a>, Nazarites are not to touch any dead bodies. But Samson was a mass murderer. 
    He must have touched hundreds of dead bodies. (Or did he just kill his victims, being careful not to touch them after they were dead?)
    
    <p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif">
    <IMG src="../images/sex1.gif">
    <IMG src="../images/wom1.gif"> (13:6-10) The angel visited Samson's mom and impregnated her while her husband wasn't around. She didn't ask him where he came from and he refused to tell her his name. 
    <p>(13:6) <i>" A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name."</i>    
     
     <p>(13:9) <b> <i>"The angel of God came again unto the woman 
     as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her." </i>
     
     </b>
     
     <p>(13:10) <i>"The woman ... said ... the man... came unto me the other day."</i>
     
     <p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (13:18) <i>"Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret?"</i> 
    The impregnating angel had a secret name. (Clarence?, 007?, agent 99?)
    
    <p><img src="../images/cr1.gif"> (13:19) <i>"Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it upon a rock unto the Lord."</i>
    
    <p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (13:20)  <i>"The angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And
    Manoah and his wife ... fell on their faces."</i> 
    (<a href="../topics/FOF.html" title="And they fell on their faces (FOF)">FOF</a>)
    
    <p> <img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (13:21) <i>"But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife.
    Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD."</i> Manoah and his wife knew the angel was from God because they never saw him again.
    
    <p><img src="../images/contra1.gif" > (13:22) <i>"We shall surely die, because we have seen God."</i><br>
  <a href="../contra/seen.html">Can God be seen?</a>
  
  <p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif"> (13:24-25) Samson was one of the vilest 
     of all the vile Bible heroes; yet he was especially blessed by God.
     
     <p>(13:24) <i>"And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and ... t<b>he LORD blessed him.</b>"</i>
  
  <p>(13:25) <i>"The child grew, and the Lord blessed him. And <b>the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times.</b>"</i><br>

  And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose

  <tr><td><B><A name="3">13:3</A></B>

    to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.    

  <tr><td><B><A name="6">13:6</A></B>
  Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, <span class="s">A man of God came unto me,</span>
    <span class="a">and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God, very
    terrible: but I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name:</span>

  Then Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God
    which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto
    the child that shall be born.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="9">13:9</A></B>
  And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and <b> <span class="s">the angel of God came again unto the woman

  <tr><td><B><A name="11">13:11</A></B>
  And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said
    unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I am.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="12">13:12</A></B>
  And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the
    child, and how shall we do unto him?

  And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the
    woman let her beware.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="14">13:14</A></B>
  She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither let her

  And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will
    not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must
    offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the
    LORD.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="17">13:17</A></B>

  So <span class="v">Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it upon a rock unto

  For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the
