<img src="../../images/abs1.gif"><i>"I, Abraham, had the Urim and Thummim."</i><br>
Abraham had the Urim and Thummim just like Joseph Smith! Maybe it was the very same pair! (How cool is that?)

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif">
<img src="../../images/sci1.gif"> (3:2-3)<br>
<i>"The name of the great on is Kolob ... for it is near to me."</i><br>
God lives on or near the planet (or star) named Kolob.

	<span class="a">one of them was nearest unto the throne of God</span>; and there 
were many great ones which were near unto it;

<tr><td><a name="3"></a><b>3:3</b> And the Lord said unto me: These are the governing ones; and <span class="sci">the name of the great one is Kolob, because it is

its times and seasons in the revolutions thereof; that one revolution was a day unto the Lord, after his manner of reckoning, it being one 
thousand years according to the time appointed unto that whereon thou standest. 
	<span class="a">This is the reckoning of the Lord's time, according to the reckoning

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif">
<img src="../../images/sci1.gif">(3:4) <i>"By the Urim and Thummim, that Kolob was after the manner of the Lord...."</i><br>
I guess God created his home planet, Kolob, using a Urim and Thummim or something. (I wish Abraham wouldn't get so technical!)

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif">
<img src="../../images/sci1.gif">(3:4)<i>"This is the reckoning of the Lord's time, according to the reckoning of Kolob."</i>

I think you'd have to be from Kolob to understand any of this.

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif">
<img src="../../images/sci1.gif">(3:6)
<i>"And the Lord said unto me: Now, Abraham, these two facts exist, behold thine eyes see it; it is given unto thee 
to know the times of reckoning, and the set time, yea, the set time of the earth upon which thou standest...."</i><br>
(If you don't understand this, that's okay. It didn't make any sense to Joseph Smith either.)

</font>

<tr><td><a name="5"></a><b>3:5</b> <span class="a">And the Lord said unto me: The planet which is the lesser light, lesser than that which is to rule the day, even 
the night, is above or greater than that upon which thou standest in point of reckoning</span>, for it moveth in order more slow; this is in order because 
it standeth above the earth upon which thou standest, therefore the reckoning of its time is not so many as to its number of days, and of months, 
and of years.

<tr><td><a name="6"></a><b>3:6</b> <span class="a">And the Lord said unto me: Now, Abraham, these two facts exist, behold thine eyes see it; it is given unto thee

<tr><td><a name="7"></a><b>3:7</b> Now the set time of the lesser light is a longer time as to its reckoning than the reckoning of the time of 
the earth upon which thou standest.

 <font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif">
<img src="../../images/sci1.gif"> <i>"And it is given unto thee to know the set time of all the stars that are set to give light."</i><br>
God told Abraham the "set times" of all the stars in the universe. (There are about 100 billion galaxies with 100 billion or so stars in each. But 
God gave the 10<sup>22</sup> "set times" to Abraham.)
</font>

<tr><td><a name="11"></a><b>3:11</b> Thus I, Abraham, talked with the Lord, face to face, as one man talketh with another; and he told me of the 
works which his hands had made;

<tr><td><a name="12"></a><b>3:12</b> And he said unto me: My son, my son (and his hand was stretched out), behold I will show you all these. 
And he put his hand upon mine eyes, and I saw those things which his hands had made, which were many; and they multiplied before mine eyes, 
and I could not see the end thereof.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><a name="13"></a><b>3:13</b> And he said unto me: This is 
	<span class="sci">Shinehah</span>, which is <span class="sci">the sun</span>. And he said unto me:
	<span class="sci">Kokob</span>, which is <span class="sci">star</span>. And he 
said unto me: <span class="sci">Olea</span>, which is the <span class="sci">moon</span>. And he said unto me:<span class="sci"> Kokaubeam</span>, which signifies 
	<span class="sci">stars</span>, or all the great lights, which were in the 
firmament of heaven.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

 <font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/sci1.gif">
The correct name (the names that God uses) for the sun, moon, star, and stars are Shinehah, Olea, Kokob, and Koaubeam, respectively.
</font>

<tr><td><a name="14"></a><b>3:14</b> And it was in the night time when the Lord spake these words unto me: I will multiply thee, and thy seed 
after thee, like unto these; and if thou canst count the number of sands, so shall be the number of thy seeds.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><a name="15"></a><b>3:15</b> And the Lord said unto me: Abraham, I show these things unto thee before ye go into Egypt, that ye may 
declare all these words.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><a name="16"></a><b>3:16</b> <span class="a">If two things exist, and there be one above the other, there shall be greater things above them; 
therefore Kolob is the greatest of all the Kokaubeam that thou hast seen, because it is nearest unto me.</span><td bgcolor="eeeeee" rowspan="5">

 <img src="../../images/abs1.gif">
<img src="../../images/sci1.gif">(3:16)<br>
<i>"Kolob is the greatest of all the Kokaubeam ... because it is nearest unto me."</i><br>
Kolob is the star nearest God. 

 <p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif">
<img src="../../images/sci1.gif">(3:17)<br>
"<i>If there be two things, one above the other, and the moon be above the earth, then it may be that 
a planet or a star may exist above it."</i><br>
Since the moon is above the earth, then a planet or a star may also be above the earth. (The mind of God is a frightening thing.)

 <p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (3:18) <i>"They are gnolaum."</i><br>
 There are two spirits, one more intelligent than the other, yet both are gnolaum. 
 
 <p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (3:19) <i>"I am more intelligent than they all."</i><br>
 God is even more intelligent they those other two spirits. (Whoever they might be.)

</font>

<tr><td><a name="17"></a><b>3:17</b> Now, <span class="sci">if there be two things, one above the other, and the moon be above the earth, then it may be that 
a planet or a star may exist above it;</span> and there is nothing that the Lord thy God shall take in his heart to do but what he will do it.

<tr><td><a name="18"></a><b>3:18</b> Howbeit that he made the greater star; as, also, if there be two spirits, and one shall be more intelligent 
than the other, yet these two spirits, notwithstanding one is more intelligent than the other, have no beginning; they existed before, they 
shall have no end, they shall exist after, for <span class="a">they are gnolaum</a>, or eternal.

<tr><td><a name="19"></a><b>3:19</b> And the Lord said unto me: These two facts do exist, that there are two spirits, one being more intelligent 
than the other; there shall be another more intelligent than they; I am the Lord thy God, <span class="a">I am more intelligent than they all.</span>

<tr><td><a name="20"></a><b>3:20</b> The Lord thy God sent his angel to deliver thee from the hands of the priest of Elkenah.

<tr><td><a name="21"></a><b>3:21</b> I dwell in the midst of them all; I now, therefore, have come down unto thee to declare unto thee the 
works which my hands have made, wherein my wisdom excelleth them all, for I rule in the heavens above, and in the earth beneath, in all wisdom 
and prudence, over all the intelligences thine eyes have seen from the beginning; I came down in the beginning in the midst of all the 
intelligences thou hast seen.<td bgcolor="eeeeee" rowspan="8">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (3:22-23) <i>"Thou  art one of them."</i><br>
Many "noble and great" intelligences existed before the earth was created, and Abraham was among them.

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (3:24)
<i>"We will go down ... and make an earth."</i><br>
Someone who looked a lot like God decided to go down and make an earth (since there was plenty of space and material, and nothing much else to do).

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (3:26) <i>"They who keep their first estate shall be added upon ... and they who keep their second estate 
shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"><i> (3:27-28) "The Lord said: I will send the first."</i><br>
There were two guys, one of which was "like unto the Son of Man" (that'd be Jesus). They both wanted to be sent (somewhere). God chose the 
Jesus look-alike. The other guy was angry and didn't keep his first estate and many others followed him. 

<p>Since none of this makes any sense, I'll let <a href="http://www.lds.org/library/display/0,4945,11-1-13-6,00.html">the LDS church</a> explain 
it all for you.
<blockquote>Our Father said, "Whom shall I send?" (Abraham 3:27). Two of our brothers offered to help. Our oldest brother, 
Jesus Christ, who was then called Jehovah, said, "Here am I, send me" (Abraham 3:27). <br>
...<br>
Satan, who was called Lucifer, also came, saying, "Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul 
shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor" (Moses 4:1).  <br>
...<br>
After hearing both sons speak, Heavenly Father said, "I will send the first" (Abraham 3:27).

<tr><td><a name="22"></a><b>3:22</b> Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the <span class="a">intelligences that were organized before the 
world was</span>; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones;


 <tr><td><a name="23"></a><b>3:23</b> And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will 
 make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, <span class="a">thou 
 art one of them</span>;  thou wast chosen before thou wast born.
 
<tr><td><a name="24"></a><b>3:24</b> And there stood <span class="a">one among them that was like unto God, and he said</span> unto those who 
were with him: <span class="a">We will go down</span>, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will 
<span class="a">make an earth whereon these may dwell</a>;

<tr><td><a name="25"></a><b>3:25</b> And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall 
command them;

<tr><td><a name="26"></a><b>3:26</b> And <span class="a">they who keep their first estate shall be added upon</span>; and they who keep not their first estate 
shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate; <span class="a">and they who keep their second estate shall have glory 
added upon their heads for ever and ever.</span>

<tr><td><a name="27"></a><b>3:27</b> And the Lord said: Whom shall I send? And one answered like unto the Son of Man: Here am I, send me. 
And another answered and said: Here am I, send me. And the Lord said: I will send the first.

<tr><td><a name="28"></a><b>3:28</b> And the second was angry, and kept not his first estate; and, at that day, many followed after him.
