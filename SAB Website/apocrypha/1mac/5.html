	"people without number" preparing to attack. So they sounded their trumpets and cried out in prayer, which scared the hell out of Timotheus' 
	army, who fled away in terror as Judas' men killed "almost eight thousand." Then Judas did unto the city of Maspha as he did to Bosor -- 
	burning it to the ground after kiling every male "with the edge of the sword." And then he did likewise to "Casbon, and Mageth, and Bosor, 
	and the rest of the cities of Galaad." (I guess he slaughtered Bosor again just for the heck of it.)
