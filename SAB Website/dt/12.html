After God kills those of other faiths, be sure to reject their beliefs and do not 
learn about them. Otherwise God will have to kill you too.

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif" > (12:32) <b><i>"What thing soever I command you,

You must follow all of the Old Testament's laws.
Don't add or take away from it. Why then don't modern Bible-believers
stone to death blasphemers, sabbath breakers, and disobedient sons?
