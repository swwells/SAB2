Christs that will deceive many (6), 
    wars and rumors of wars (7), earthquakes, famines, and "troubles." And that's just "the beginning of sorrows" (8). 
    
   <p>Believers will be beaten (9), the gospel will be published in every nation (10), family members will betray each other (12), 
  and believers will be hated by everyone. But don't worry. If you make through all that, you will be saved (13).
    
    <p>When you see "the abomination of desolations," go to the mountains (14). 
	Don't' bother with clothes. (15-16) 
    And God help you if you're pregnant or nursing (17) or if the abomination shows up in winter (18).  Trust me, it's going to 
    be hell out there (19).
    
    <p>There will be false Christs with signs and wonders trying to seduce you (22). But just remember, Jesus told you so (23). The sun and moon 
    will be darkened (24) and the stars will fall to the ground (25). Then Jesus in all his glory will come down from the clouds (26).
    
    <p>Oh, and all these things will happen within the lifespan of Jesus' contemporaries (30).

    and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded
    the porter to watch.
