"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",
"<span class='i'>Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever.</span>--<a href='3.html#14'>Alma 3:14</a>",
"<span class='i'>I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</span>--<a href='3.html#15'>Alma 3:15</a>",
"<span class='I'>If ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd ... the devil is your shepherd.</span>--<a href='5.html#39'>Alma 5:39</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",
"<span class='a'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges ... even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year....</span>--<a href='16.html#1'>Alma 16:1</a>",
"<span class='a'>Their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.</span>--<a href='16.html#11'>Alma 16:11</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",
"<span class='v'>He [Ammon] smote off their arms with his sword; for he did withstand their blows by smiting their arms with the edge of his sword.</span>--<a href='17.html#37'>Alma 17:37</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.   Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</span>--<a href='30.html#22'>Alma 30:22</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",
"<span class='i'>God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.</span>--<a href='30.html#47'>Alma 30:47</a>",
"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Amalekites were of a more wicked and murderous disposition than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='43.html#6'>Alma 43:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lord is with us; and ye behold that he has delivered you into our hands.</span>--<a href='44.html#3'>Alma 44:3</a>",
"<span class='i'>God ... has strengthened  our arms that we have gained power over you, by  our faith, by our religion, and by our rites of worship, and by  our church.</span>--<a href='44.html#5'>Alma 44:5</a>",
"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",
"<span class='i'>These dissenters ... became ... more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='47.html#36'>Alma 47:36</a>",
"<span class='a'>God would prosper them in the land, or in other words ... God ... would prosper them in the land.</span>--<a href='48.html#15'>Alma 48:15</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='50.html#22'>Alma 50:22</a>",
"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",
"<span class='i'>The remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty.</span>--<a href='51.html#20'>Alma 51:20</a>",
"<span class='g'>And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye.</span>--<a href='54.html#21'>Alma 54:21</a>",
"<span class='v'>We did slay upwards of two thousand of them after they had surrendered themselves prisoners of war.</span>--<a href='57.html#14'>Alma 57:14</a>",

but behold, there was no way that we could lead them out of the city by our small bands.  For behold, 
they remembered that which we had hitherto done; therefore we could not decoy them away from their 
strongholds. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

[58:1, 4(2), 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23(2), 26, 28, 29, 30]
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>58:2</b>   And they were so much more numerous than was our army that we durst not go forth and 
attack them in their strongholds. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>58:3</b>   Yea, and it became expedient that we should employ our men to the maintaining those parts of 
the land which we had regained of our possessions; therefore it became expedient that we should wait, that 
we might receive more strength from the land of Zarahemla and also a new supply of provisions. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>58:4</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that I thus did send an embassy to the governor 
of our land, to acquaint him concerning the affairs of our people.  <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> 
that we did wait to receive provisions and strength from the land of Zarahemla. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>58:5</b>   But behold, this did profit us but little; for the Lamanites were also receiving great 
strength from day to day, and also many provisions; and thus were our circumstances at this period of 
time. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>58:6</b>   And the Lamanites were sallying forth against us from time to time, resolving by 
stratagem to destroy us; nevertheless we could not come to battle with them, because of their retreats 
and their strongholds. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>58:7</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that we did wait in these difficult circumstances 
for the space of many months, even until we were about to perish for the want of food. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>58:8</b>   <span class="a">But it came to pass </span>that we did receive food, which was guarded to us by an army of two 
thousand men to our assistance; and this is all the assistance which we did receive, to defend ourselves 
and our country from falling into the hands of our enemies, yea, to contend with an enemy which was 
innumerable. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>58:9</b>   And now the cause of these our embarrassments, or the cause why they did not send more strength 
unto us, we knew not; therefore we were grieved and also filled with fear, lest by any means the judgments of 
God should come upon our land, to our overthrow and utter destruction. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>58:10</b>   Therefore we did pour out our souls in prayer to God, that he would strengthen us and 
deliver us out of the hands of our enemies, yea, and also give us strength that we might retain our 
cities, and our lands, and our possessions, for the support of our people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>58:11</b>   Yea, <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Lord our God did visit us with 
assurances that he would deliver us; yea, insomuch that he did speak peace to our souls, and did grant 
unto us great faith, and did cause us that we should hope for our deliverance in him. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>58:12</b>   And we did take courage with our small force which we had received, and were fixed with a 
determination to conquer our enemies, and to maintain our lands, and our possessions, and our wives, and 
our children, and the cause of our liberty. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>58:13</b>   And thus we did go forth with all our might against the Lamanites, who were in the 
city of Manti; and we did pitch our tents by the wilderness side, which was near to the city. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>58:14</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that on the morrow, that when the 
Lamanites saw that we were in the borders by the wilderness which was near the city, that they sent 
out their spies round about us that they might discover the number and the strength of our army. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>58:15</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when they saw that we were not strong, 
according to our numbers, and fearing that we should cut them off from their support except they should 
come out to battle against us and kill us, and also supposing that they could easily destroy us with their 
numerous hosts, therefore they began to make preparations to come out against us to battle. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>58:16</b>   And when we saw that they were making preparations to come out against us, behold, I caused 
that Gid, with a small number of men, should secrete himself in the wilderness, and also that Teomner and a 
small number of men should secrete themselves also in the wilderness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>58:17</b>   Now Gid and his men were on the right and the others on the left; and when they had thus 
secreted themselves, behold, I remained, with the remainder of my army, in that same place where we had 
first pitched our tents against the time that the Lamanites should come out to battle. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>58:18</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Lamanites did come out with their 
numerous army against us.  And when they had come and were about to fall upon us with the sword, I 
caused that my men, those who were with me, should retreat into the wilderness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>58:19</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Lamanites did follow after us with 
great speed, for they were <span class="a">exceedingly</span> desirous to overtake us that they might 
slay us; therefore they did follow us into the wilderness; and we did pass by in the midst of Gid and Teomner, 
insomuch that they were not discovered by the Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1"><a href="exceed_list.html">Exceedingly</a> (58:19, 24, 29)
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>58:20</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when the Lamanites had passed by, or when 
the army had passed by, Gid and Teomner did rise up from their secret places, and did cut off the spies of 
the Lamanites that they should not return to the city. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>58:21</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when they had cut them off, they ran to 
the city and fell upon the guards who were left to guard the city, insomuch that they did destroy them 
and did take possession of the city. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>58:22</b>   Now this was done because the Lamanites did suffer their whole army, save a few guards 
only, to be led away into the wilderness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>58:23</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Gid and Teomner by this means had 
obtained possession of their strongholds.  <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that we took our 
course, after having traveled much in the wilderness towards the land of Zarahemla. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>58:24</b>   And when the Lamanites saw that they were marching towards the land of Zarahemla, 
they were <span class="a">exceedingly</span> afraid, lest there was a plan laid to lead them on to 
destruction; therefore they began to retreat into the wilderness again, yea, even back by the same 
way which they had come. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>58:25</b>   And behold, it was night and they did pitch their tents, for the chief captains of the 
Lamanites had supposed that the Nephites were weary because of their march; and supposing that they had 
driven their whole army therefore they took no thought concerning the city of Manti. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>58:26</b>   <span class="a">Now it came to pass</span> that when it was night, I caused that my men should not sleep, but that 
they should march forward by another way towards the land of Manti. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>58:27</b>   And because of this our march in the night-time, behold, on the morrow we were beyond the 
Lamanites, insomuch that we did arrive before them at the city of Manti. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>58:28</b>   <span class="a">And thus it came to pass</span>, that by this stratagem we did take possession of the city of 
Manti without the shedding of blood. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">


<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>58:29</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when the armies of the Lamanites did 
arrive near the city, and saw that we were prepared to meet them, they were 
astonished <span class="a">exceedingly</span> and struck with great fear, insomuch that they did flee into 
the wilderness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>58:30</b>   Yea, <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the armies of the Lamanites did flee 
out of all this quarter of the land.  But behold, they have carried with them many women and children out 
of the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>58:31</b>   And those cities which had been taken by the Lamanites, all of them are at this period 
of time in our possession; and our fathers and our women and our children are returning to their homes, 
all save it be those who have been taken prisoners and carried off by the Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="32"></a>58:32</b>   But behold, our armies are small to maintain so great a number of cities and so great 
possessions. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="33"></a>58:33</b>   But behold, we trust in our God who has given us victory over those lands, insomuch that 
we have obtained those cities and those lands, which were our own. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="34"></a>58:34</b>   Now we do not know the cause that the government does not grant us more strength; neither 
do those men who came up unto us know why we have not received greater strength. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="35"></a>58:35</b>   Behold, we do not know but what ye are unsuccessful, and ye have drawn away the forces 
into that quarter of the land; if so, we do not desire to murmur. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="36"></a>58:36</b>   And if it is not so, behold, we fear that there is some faction in the government, that 
they do not send more men to our assistance; for we know that they are more numerous than that which they 
have sent. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="37"></a>58:37</b>   But, behold, it mattereth not -- we trust God will deliver us, notwithstanding the 
weakness of our armies, yea, and deliver us out of the hands of our enemies. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="38"></a>58:38</b>   Behold, this is the twenty and ninth year, in the latter end, and we are in the possession 
of our lands; and the Lamanites have fled to the land of Nephi. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="39"></a>58:39</b>   And those sons of the people of Ammon, of whom I have so highly spoken, are with me in the 
city of Manti; and the Lord had supported them, yea, and kept them from falling by the sword, insomuch that 
even one soul has not been slain. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="40"></a>58:40</b>   But behold, they have received many wounds; nevertheless they 
<span class="c">stand fast in that liberty 
wherewith God has made them free</span>; and they are strict to remember the Lord their God from day to day; yea, 
they do observe to keep his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments continually; and their faith 
is strong in the prophecies concerning that which is to come. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/plag.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1">Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free... -- 
<a href="../../gal/5.html#1">Gal.5:1</a></font>

<tr><td><b><a name="41"></a>58:41</b>   And now, my beloved brother, Moroni, may the Lord our God, who has redeemed us and made 
us free, keep you continually in his presence; yea, and may he favor this people, even that ye may have 
success in obtaining the possession of all that which the Lamanites have taken from us, which was for 
our support.  And now, behold, I close mine epistle.  I am Helaman, the son of Alma. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
