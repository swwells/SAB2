God tells the Israelites to smear some blood on their doors. That way when he's 
going around killing Egyptian children, he'll remember not to kill their children too. He probably said to himself when he 
saw the blood, "Oh yeah, I remember now. I'm not supposed to kill the children in this house." (And be sure to sacrifice a male lamb. Only males
are good enough for God.)
