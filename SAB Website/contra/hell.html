    <dt><i><b>Yes, God tortures some people forever after they die.</b></i>    
     
      <p><dd>And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to
    everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. <a href="../dan/12.html#2">Daniel 12:2</a>
       
    
    <p><dd>The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things
    that offend, and them which do iniquity; And shall cast them
    into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. <a href="../mt/13.html#41">Matthew 13:41-42</a>
    
    <p><dd>If thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it
    is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two
    hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire. <a href="../mt/18.html#8">Matthew 18:8-9</a>
    
    <p><dd>Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him
    into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <a href="../mt/22.html#13">Matthew 22:13</a>
    
    <p><dd>Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting
    fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. ... And these shall go away into everlasting punishment. 
    <a href="../mt/25.html#41">Matthew 25:41, 46</a>
    
    <p><dd>... into hell, into the fire that never shall be  quenched Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. 
    <a href="../mk/9.html#43">Mark 9:43-48</a>
    
    <p><DD>And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels
    into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried; And in hell he lift up
    his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his
    bosom. And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip
    of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. <A href="../lk/16.html#22">Luke 16:22-24</A>
    
    <p><dd>The hour is coming, in the which all that are in
    the graves shall hear his voice, And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and 
    they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation. <a href="../jn/5.html#28">John 5:28-29</a>
    
    <p><dd>In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: 
    Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction. <a href="../2th/1.html#8">2 Thessalonians 1:8-9</a>
    
    <p><dd>The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture
    into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in
    the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever 
    and ever. <a href="../rev/14.html#10">Revelation 14:10-11</a>
    
    <p><dd>And the devil that
    deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast
    and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever
    and ever. <a href="../rev/20.html#10">Revelation 20:10</a>
    
    <p><dd>And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
        And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. 
        <a href="../rev/20.html#14">Revelation 20:14-15</a>
           
      <p><dt><b><i>No, those that don't go to heaven, just die.</i></b>
      
  <p><dd>The LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven. <a href="../dt/29.html#20">Deuteronomy 29:20</a>

    remembrance of them from the earth. <a href="../ps/34.html#16">Psalm 34:16</a>
    
    <p><dd>Fret not thyself because of evildoers.... For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green
    herb. <a href="../ps/37.html#1">Psalm 37:1-2</a>
    
    <p><dd>The wicked shall perish. <a href="../ps/37.html#20">Psalm 37:20</a>
    
    <p><dd>Let them be blotted out of the book of the living. <a href="../ps/69.html#28">Psalm 69:28</a>
    
    <p><dd>As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more. <a href="../pr/10.html#25">Proverbs 10:25</a>
    
    <p><dd>The candle of the wicked shall be put out. <a href="../pr/24.html#20">Proverbs 24:20</a>
    
    <p><dd>They shall be as though they had not been. <a href="../ob/1.html#16">Obadiah 16</a>

    <p><dd>For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life. <a href="../rom/6.html#23">Romans 6:23</a>
    
    <p><dd>If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy. <a href="../1cor/3.html#17">1 Corinthians 3:17</a>
       
    <p><dd>In them that are saved, and in them that perish. <a href="../2cor/2.html#15">2 Corinthians 2:15</a>
    
    <p><dd>For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption. <a href="../gal/6.html#8">Galatians 6:8</a>
    
    <p><dd>The enemies of the cross of Christ: Whose end is destruction. <a href="../phil/3.html#18">Philippians 3:18-19</a>
    
    <p><dd>Sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death. <a href="../jas/1.html#15">James 1:15</a>
