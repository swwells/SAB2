Verse 36 claims that this fulfilled a prophecy: &quot;Not a bone of him shall be

<p>It is sometimes said that the prophecy appears in <A href="../ex/12.html#46">Ex.12:46</A>, 
<A href="../num/9.html#12">Num.9:12</A> and <A
href="../ps/34.html#20">Ps.34:20</A>. But Exodus 12:46 and
Numbers 9:12 are not prophecies, they are commandments. The Israelites are told
not to break the bones of the Passover lamb, and this is all it is about. And
Psalm 34:20 seems to refer to righteous people in general (see verse 19, where a
plural is used), not to make a prophecy about a specific person.)

  The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should
