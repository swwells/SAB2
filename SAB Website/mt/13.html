    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0830815503/skepticsannotate">Some Christians</a> believe that the natural

Jesus is incorrect when he says that the
mustard seed is the smallest seed. (<a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/gwr5/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=47366">The epiphytic orchids have the 
smallest seeds.</a>) And since there are no trees 
in <a href="http://biodiversity.uno.edu/delta/angio/www/crucifer.htm">the mustard
family</a>, mustard seeds do not grow into trees large enough to support bird nests.

<p>(13:31-32) <i>"A ... mustard seed ...  is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, 
so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof."</i>
