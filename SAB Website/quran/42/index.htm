Almost might the heavens above be rent asunder while the angels hymn the  praise of their Lord and ask forgiveness for those on the earth. Lo! Allah, He is the  Forgiver, the Merciful. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="6"><b>42:6</a></b>

And as for those who choose protecting friends beside Him, Allah is Warden  over them, and thou art in no wise a guardian over them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><a NAME="7"><b>42:7</a></b>
And thus We have inspired in thee a Lecture in Arabic, that thou mayst warn  the

<tr><td><a NAME="12"><b>42:12</a></b>
His are the keys of the heavens and the earth. He enlargeth providence for  whom He will and 
straiteneth (it for whom He will). Lo! He is Knower of all things. 
<tr><td><a NAME="13"><b>42:13</a></b>
He hath ordained for you that religion which He commended unto Noah, and  that which We inspire in thee (Muhammad), and that which We commended unto  Abraham and Moses and Jesus, saying: Establish the religion, and be not divided  therein. Dreadful for the idolaters is that unto which thou callest them. Allah chooseth  for Himself whom He will, and guideth unto Himself him who turneth (toward Him). <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="14"><b>42:14</a></b>
And they were not divided until after the knowledge came unto them,  through rivalry among themselves; and had it not been for a Word that had already  gone forth from thy Lord for an appointed term, it surely had been judged between  them. And those who were made to inherit the Scripture after them are verily in  hopeless doubt concerning it. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="15"><b>42:15</a></b>

Unto this, then, summon (O Muhammad). And be thou upright as thou art  commanded, and follow not their lusts, but say: I believe in whatever scripture Allah  hath sent down, and I am commanded to be just among you. Allah is our Lord and  your Lord. Unto us our works and unto you your works; no argument between us and  you. Allah will bring us together, and unto Him is the journeying. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
