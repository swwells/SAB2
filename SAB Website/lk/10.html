  <img src="../images/contra1.gif"> (10:4-9) Jesus' instructions to his disciples: Take no money or shoes and don't say hello to 
  anyone that you pass by. Enter each house and eat whatever they feed you. Stay there; don't go from house to house. 
  Heal the sick and say the kingdom of heaven is here.
  
  <p> (10:4) <i>"Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes."</i><br>
  <a href="../contra/barefoot.html">Did Jesus tell his disciples to go barefoot?</a>
  
  <p>(10:7) <i>"In the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give ... Go not from house to house."</i><br>

<img src="../images/int.gif">(10:10-15) Entire cities will be
violently destroyed and the inhabitants "thrust down to hell" for not
"receiving" Jesus and his disciples.

<p>(10:10-12) <i>"Whatsoever city ... receive you not ... it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city."</i>

<p>(10:13) <i>"Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida!"</i>

<p>(10:15) <i>"And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell."</i>

    and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me."</i> If you don't like what Pat Robertson says (or any other Christian), then you 
    don't like Jesus, and if you don't like Jesus, you don't like God. 
    
  <p><img src="../images/abs1.gif">(10:17-23) The disciples return and report back to Jesus. They brag about having 
  power over devils. Jesus sees Satan fall from heaven and gives them complete power over him, along with the power over serpents and 
  scorpions, and tells them that nothing will ever hurt them in any way whatsoever. He thanked God that only the ignorant and foolish 
  will listen to him, and told his disciples how lucky they were to be able to see him.
   
  <p>(10:17)  <I>"The seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us."</I>

<p>(10:18) <i>"He </i>[Jesus] <i>said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven."</i>

<p>(10:19) <i>"I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: 
and nothing shall by any means hurt you."</i><br>
What the Bible says about <a href="../says_about/believers.html">believers</a> and 
<a href="../says_about/christians.html">Christians</a>

<p>(10:21) <i>"Jesus rejoiced ... and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the 
wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes."</i> <br>
    <a href="../contra/lord.html">Who is the Lord of the earth?</a>

<p>(10:23) <i>"He turned him unto his disciples, and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see."</i>

<p><img src="../images/contra1.gif">(10:25-28) Jesus tells the lawyer that those who
love God and their neighbor will be saved.<br> 
<A href="../contra/words.html">How are people judged by God?</a><br>
<A href="../contra/faithalone.html">Is Salvation by faith alone?</a><br>
<a href="../contra/saved.html">What must you do to be saved?</a>

<p>(10:25) <i>"A certain lawyer ... tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"</i>

<p>(10:26) <i>"He said unto him, What is written in the law?"</i>

<p>(10:27) <i>"He ... said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, 
and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself."</i>

<p>(20:28) <i>"He said ... Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live."</i>

<p>(20:29) <i>"He ... said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?"</i>

<p><img src="../images/good1.gif">(10:30-37) The story of the good Samaritan gets my
vote for the best bible story. We should all &quot;go and do likewise.&quot;

<p>(10:33) <i>"But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had
    compassion on him."</i>

    wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="31">10:31</A></B>
