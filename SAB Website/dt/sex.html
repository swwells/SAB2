<p><li>If you see a pretty woman among the captives and would like her for a wife, then just bring her home and "go in
unto her." Later, if you decide you don't like her, you can "let her go."  <a href="21.html#11">21:11-14</a>
<p><li> If a man marries, then decides that he hates his wife, he can claim she wasn't a virgin when they were married. If

<p><li>If a woman is raped in the country, then only the man shall die (since there was no one

uncleanness that chanceth him by night ..."  <a href="23.html#10">23:10</a>

<p><li>If a man dies without having a child, his brother shall "go in unto" his dead brother's wife -- whether she likes him or
