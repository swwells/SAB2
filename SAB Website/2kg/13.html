<img src="../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32"> (13:15-17) Elisha tells Joash to shoot an arrow out the window. Joash shoots the magic arrow out the window, which guarantees that he 
will "smite the Syrians" until he "consumes them."

<p>(13:15) <i>"Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took unto him bow
    and arrows."</i>

<P>(13:16) <i>"Put thine hand upon the bow. And he put
    his hand upon it: and Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands."</i>

<p>(13:17) <i>"Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then Elisha said,
    Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the LORD's deliverance, and
    the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for thou shalt smite the Syrians in
    Aphek, till thou have consumed them."</i>
    
    <p><img src="../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32"> (13:18-19)
Elisha tells Joash to hit the ground with his arrow. So he smacks the ground 
three times. Elisha then yells at him, saying he should have struck the ground five or six times. If he had, then he 
would have completely wiped out Syria, but now since he only struck the ground three times, he'll only get to smite Syria 
three times. Shucks!

<p>(13:18) <i>"Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said 
  unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote thrice."</i>

<p>(13:19) <i>"And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have
    smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst
    consumed it: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice."</i>

    because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not
    destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet.

  So Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in his stead.
  
  <tr><td><B><A name="25">13:25</A></B>
  And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the
    son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his
    father by war. Three times did Joash beat him, and recovered the cities of
    Israel.
