    not accepting deliverance; <span class="a">that they might obtain a better resurrection</span>:
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="36"  >11:36</A></B>
  And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of
    bonds and imprisonment:
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="37"  >11:37</A></B>
  They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with
    the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute,
    afflicted, tormented;
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="38"  >11:38</A></B>
  (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in
    mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="39"  >11:39</A></B>
  And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not
    the promise:
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="40"  >11:40</A></B>
  God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should
    not be made perfect.
