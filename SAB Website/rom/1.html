Paul explains that &quot;the natural use&quot;
of women is to act as sexual objects for the pleasure of men.

<p>Notice, though, that it is God who makes gay people gay, by giving "them up to vile affections." So according to the Bible, 
gay people don't choose to be gay; they are gay because God made them that way 
(to punish them for God knows what).<br>

will make you gay!?</a>

<p><img src="../images/lang1.gif" >(1:29-31) I'm not sure who Paul is talking about here, but they're all a bunch of proud, 
wicked, malicious, deceitful murderers, backbiters, and God-haters.

<i>"They which commit such things are worthy of death."</i><br>
Homosexuals (those "without natural affection") and their 
supporters (those "that have pleasure in them") are "worthy of death."

  Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous
    journey by the will of God to come unto you.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="11">1:11</A></B>
  For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to
    the end ye may be established;
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="12">1:12</A></B>
  That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith
    both of you and me.    

  <tr><td><B><A name="13">1:13</A></B>
  Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to
    come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among
    you also, even as among other Gentiles.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="14">1:14</A></B>
  I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise,
    and to the unwise.

  <tr><td><B><A name="15">1:15</A></B>
  So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are
    at Rome also.

  <tr><td><B><A name="16">1:16</A></B>
  For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto <span class="c">salvation to every
    one that believeth</span>; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.    
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="17">1:17</A></B>

    it is written, <span class="c">The just shall live by faith.</span>    

  <tr><td><B><A name="18">1:18</A></B>
