   <IMG src="../images/fv.gif" > (16:1) After Samson finished <a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2009/11/gods-52nd-killing-samson-kills-1000.html">killing 1000 men with the jawbone of an ass</a>, 
   he had sex with a prostitute.
   
   <p>(16:1) <b><i>"Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her."</i></b>
       
<p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (16:3) At midnight, he left the prostitute and ripped out the doors and gate posts of the city and carried them to the top of a hill.

<p>(16:3) <i>"Samson ... took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them."</i>
     
<p><IMG src="../images/sex1.gif" >
   <IMG src="../images/fv.gif" > (16:4) Then Samson saw and fell in love with Delilah.
   
   <p>(16:4) <i>"Afterward ... he loved a woman ... whose name was Delilah."</i>
   
   <p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (16:6) Delilah was paid by the Philistines to find the magical source of Samson's strength and to figure out how he could be restrained. 
   So she asked Samson three times about it, while some Philistines hid in another room.
   
   <p>(16:6) <i>"Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound."</i>

 <p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (16:7-9) The first time he said that he'd become as week as any other man if he were tied up with bowstrings. So she did that and 
    then shouted, "Hey Samson, the Philistines are coming!" But he broke the bowstrings as though they were burnt strings.   
   
   <p>(16:7) <i>"Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man."</i>
   
   <p>(16:8) <i>"The Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them."</i>
   
   <p>(16:9) <i>"And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire."</i>
   
   <p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (16:10-12) She asked again and he told her to use ropes. So she tied him with ropes 
   and then shouted, "Hey Samson, the Philistines are coming!" But he broke the ropes like they were threads.
   
   <p>(16:10) <i>"Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound."</i>
   
   <p>(16:11) <i>"And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man."</i>

   <p>(16:12) <i>"Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson ... And he brake them from off his arms like a thread."</i>
  
   <p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (16:13-14) She asked him a third time, and he told her to weave his seven braids into a cloth and fasten the whole mess to the wall. 
    So she did that and then shouted, "Hey Samson (you dumb shit), the Philistines are coming!" But he broke out of that one, too.
    
    <p>(16:13) <i>"Delilah said unto Samson ... tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web."</i>
    
    <p>(16:14) <i>"And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he ... went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web."</i>

    <p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (16:16-17) But Delilah didn't give up. She kept pestering him until finally Samson told her the true source of his strength. 
    It was his hair. If his hair was shaved off, he'd become as weak as any other man.
    
    <p>(16:16-17) <i>"When she pressed him daily ... he told her ... There hath not come a razor upon mine head ... if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me,
     and I shall become weak, and be like any other man."</i>
     
     <p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (16:19-20) <br>So when Samson fell asleep on her lap, she cut his hair. 
     
    <p>(16:19) <i>"She made him sleep upon her knees ... to shave off the seven locks of his head ... and his strength went from him."</i>
    
    <p>(16:20) <i>"And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him."</i>
 
<p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (16:21) Then the Philistines captured Samson, gouged out his eyes, 
    and put him in prison. 
    
    <p>(16:21) <i>"The Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house."</i>

     Later, at one of their big parties, the Philistines brought Samson out to entertain them. Then Samson, with God's help, killed himself
and 3000 Philistine men and women by causing a roof to collapse. This was the first suicide terrorist attack. God approved of of it and gave Samson the strength to do it. And although 
the Bible doesn't say so, there are unconfirmed reports that Samson shouted "God is great (Allahu Akbar)" as the walss came tumbling down.<br>

  And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they
    compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city,

  And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her,

  Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she
    said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withs,
    as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was
    not known.

  And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be

  And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart

  And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged
    him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="17">16:17</A></B>
  That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a

  <tr><td><B><A name="18">16:18</A></B>
  And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and
    called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he
    hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto
    her, and brought money in their hand.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="19">16:19</A></B>
  And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she
    caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to
    afflict him, and his strength went from him.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="20">16:20</A></B>
  And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of
    his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake
    myself. And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="21">16:21</A></B>
  But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down
    to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison
    house.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="22">16:22</A></B>
  Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.  

  <tr><td><B><A name="23">16:23</A></B>
  Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a
    great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god
    hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="24">16:24</A></B>
  And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our
    god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our
    country, which slew many of us.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="25">16:25</A></B>
  And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call
    for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the
    prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="26">16:26</A></B>
  And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I
    may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon
    them.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="27">16:27</A></B>
  <span class="v">Now the house was full of</span> men and women; and all the lords of the
    Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof <span class="v">about three thousand
    men and women</span>, that beheld while Samson made sport.

  <span class="v">And Samson called unto

  <tr><td><B><A name="29">16:29</A></B>
  And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood,
    and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the
    other with his left.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="30">16:30</A></B>
  And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself
    with all his might; <span class="v">and

    the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his

  Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him,
