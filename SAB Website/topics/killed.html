<H3>People Killed by God</H3>
<p>God drowns all humans, beasts, creeping things, fowls, and "all flesh wherein there is breath of life."

<blockquote>And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the 
  face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls 
  of the air. <a href="../gen/6.html#7">Gen.6:7</a></blockquote>
<blockquote>And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, 
  to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and 
  every thing that is in the earth shall die. <a href="../gen/6.html#17">Gen.6:17</a></blockquote>
<blockquote>For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty 
  days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I 
  destroy from off the face of the earth. 
    <a href="../gen/7.html#4">Gen.7:4</a></blockquote>
<blockquote>And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every
    creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man: All in whose 
  nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died. And 
  every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, 
  both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and 
  they were destroyed from the earth: 
    <a href="../gen/7.html#21">Gen.7:21-23</a></blockquote>
   
<p>God kills everyone (men, women, children, infants, newborns) in Sodom and Gomorrah by raining "fire and brimstone from the Lord out of heaven."
    Well, almost everyone -- he spares the "just and righteous" 
<a href="lot.html">Lot</a> and his family. 
<p><blockquote>Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire
    from the LORD out of heaven. <a href="../gen/19.html#24">Gen.19:24</a></blockquote>
<p>Lot's nameless wife looks back, and God turns her into a pillar of salt. 
<p><blockquote>But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt. 
<a href="../gen/19.html#26">Gen.19:26</a></blockquote>
<p>"And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord; and the Lord slew him." <a href="../gen/38.html#7">Gen.38:7</a>
<p>After God killed Er, Judah tells Onan to "go in unto they brother's wife." But "Onan knew that the seed should not 
be his; and ... when he went in unto his brother's wife ... he spilled it on the ground.... And the thing which he did 
displeased the Lord; wherefore he slew him also." <a href="../gen/38.html#8">Gen.38:8-10</a>
<p>After God has sufficiently <a href="harden.html">hardened</a> the Pharaoh's heart, he kills all the firstborn Egyptian children. When he was
finished "there was not a house where there was not one dead." Finally, he runs out of little babies to kill, so he slaughters the
firstborn cattle, too.
<p><blockquote>And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the
     firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that
     sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in
     the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle. 
     And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a
     great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead. 
     <a href="../ex/12.html#29">Ex.12:29-30</a></blockquote>
<p>God drowns the Egyptian army.
<p><blockquote>The LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. 
     And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh
     that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them. 
     <a href="../ex/14.html#27">Ex.14:17-28</a></blockquote>
<p>Joshua, with God's approval, kills the Amalekites "with the edge of the sword." 
<p><blockquote>And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. 
     And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the
     ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven. 
     <a href="../ex/17.html#13">Ex.17:13</a></blockquote>
<p>For dancing naked around Aaron's golden calf (it was Aaron's idea), God orders the people to kill each other. 
(3,000 died)<p><blockquote>Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every  man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate
     throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour. 
     And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three
     thousand men. ... And the LORD plagued
    the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.<a href="../ex/32.html#27">Ex.32:27-28, 35</a></blockquote> 

<p>God kills Aaron's sons for offering strange fire before the Lord <a href="../lev/10.html#1">Lev.10:1-3</a>, 
<a href="../num/3.html#4">Num.3:4</a>
<p>"And when the people complained, it displeased the Lord: and the Lord heard it." (He had his hearing
aid on.) He then burns the complainers alive. That'll teach them. <a href="../num/11.html#1">Num.11:1</a>
<p>Because of a dispute between Korah and Moses, God makes the ground open up and 
it swallows Korah and his family. And then, just for the hell of it, God has a fire burn 250 men to death. 
<a href="../num/16.html#20">Num.16:20-35</a>
<p>After God killed Korah, his family, and
250 innocent bystanders, the people complained saying, &quot;ye have killed the
people of the Lord.&quot; So God, who doesn't take kindly to criticism, sends a
plague that killed another 14,700. <a href="../num/16.html#41">Num.16:41-50</a>
<p>God killed 24,000 Israelites for "committing whoredom with the daughters of Moab." <a href="../num/25.html#9">Num.25:9</a>
<p>God killed Nadab and Abihu for offering strange fire before the Lord <a href="../num/26.html#62">Num.26:61</a>
