<p><b><a href="../mt/cr_list.html">Matthew</a></b>

<p><li>Those who bear bad fruit will be cut down and burned "with unquenchable fire."  <a href="../mt/3.html#10">3:10, 12</a>

<p><li>Jesus strongly approves of the law and the prophets. He hasn't the slightest objection to the cruelties of the Old
Testament.  <a href="../mt/5.html#17">5:17</a>

<p><li>Jesus recommends that to avoid sin we cut off our hands and pluck out our eyes. This advice 
is given immediately after he says that anyone who looks with lust at any women commits 
adultery.  <a href="../mt/5.html#29">5:29-30</a>

<p><li>Jesus says that most people will go to hell. <a href="../mt/7.html#13">7:13-14</a>

<p><li>Those who fail to bear "good fruit" will be "hewn down, and cast into the fire." <a href="../mt/7.html#19">7:19</a>

<p><li>"The children of the kingdom [the Jews] shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall 
be weeping and gnashing of teeth." <a href="../mt/8.html#12">8:12</a>

<p><li>Jesus tells a man who had just lost his father: "Let the dead bury the dead."  <a href="../mt/8.html#21">8:21</a>

<p><li>Jesus sends some devils into a herd of pigs, causing them to run off a cliff and drown in the waters 
below. <a href="../mt/8.html#32">8:32</a>

<p><li>Cities that neither &quot;receive&quot;
the disciples nor &quot;hear&quot; their words will be destroyed by God. It will
be worse for them than for Sodom and Gomorrah. And you know what God supposedly
did to those poor folks (see <A href="../gen/19.html#24">Gen 19:24</A>).
 <a href="../mt/10.html#14">10:14-15</a>
 
<p><li>Families will be torn apart because of Jesus (this is one of the few "prophecies" in 
the Bible that has actually come
true). "Brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the 
children shall rise up against their parents,
and cause them to be put to death."  <a href="../mt/10.html#21">10:21</a>

<p><li>Jesus says that we should fear God who is willing and "able to destroy both soul and body in hell." 
 <a href="../mt/10.html#28">10:28</a>
 
 <p><li>Jesus says that he has come to destroy families by making family members hate each other. He has "come not to
send peace, but a sword."  <a href="../mt/10.html#34">10:34-36</a>

<p><li>Jesus condemns entire cities to dreadful deaths and to the eternal torment of hell because they didn't care for his
preaching.  <a href="../mt/11.html#20">11:20-24</a>

<p><li>Jesus will send his angels to gather up "all that offend" and they "shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there
shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth."  <a href="../mt/13.html#41">13:41-42, 50</a>

<p><li>Jesus is criticized by the Pharisees for not
washing his hands before eating. He defends himself by attacking them for not
killing disobedient children according to the commandment: &quot;He that curseth
father or mother, let him die the death.&quot; (See <A href="../ex/21.html#15">Ex 21:15</A>,
<A href="../lev/20.html#9">Lev 20:9</A>, <A href="../dt/21.html#18">Dt 21:18-21</A>) 
So, does Jesus think that children who curse their parents should be killed? It 
sure sounds like it. <a href="../mt/15.html#4">15:4-7</a>

<p><li>Jesus advises his followers to mutilate themselves by cutting off their hands and plucking out their eyes. He says it's
better to be "maimed" than to suffer "everlasting fire." <a href="../mt/18.html#8">18:8-9</a>

<p><li>In the parable of the unforgiving servant, the king threatens to enslave a man and his entire family to pay for a debt. 
This practice, which was common at the time, seems not to have bothered Jesus very much.
The parable ends with this: "So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you." If you are cruel to others, 
God will be cruel to you. <a href="../mt/18.html#23">18:23-35</a>

<p><li>"And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors." <a href="../mt/18.html#34">18:34</a>

<p><li>God is like a rich man who owns a vineyard and rents it to poor farmers. When he sends servants to collect the rent, 
the tenants beat or kill them. So he sent his son to collect the rent, and they kill him too. Then the owner comes and kills 
the farmers and rents the vineyard to others. <a href="../mt/21.html#33">21:33-41</a>

<p><li>"Whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder." 
Whoever falls on "this stone" (Jesus) will be broken, and whomever the stone falls on will be ground into powder. 
<a href="../mt/21.html#44">21:44</a>

<p><li>In the parable of the marriage feast, the king sends his servants to gather everyone they can find, both bad and
good, to come to the wedding feast. One guest didn't have on his wedding garment, so the king tied him up and "cast him
into the outer darkness" where "there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth." 
<a href="../mt/22.html#1">22:1-14</a>

<p><li>The end of the world will be signaled by wars, famines, disease, and earthquakes (6-7). And that's just 
    "the beginning of sorrows" (8). Next believers will be hated and killed by unbelievers (9), believers will hate and betray each other (10), false 
    prophets will fool people (11), iniquity will abound and love wax cold (12). But hey, if you make through all that, you'll be saved (13).  
    
    <p>Only one more thing will happen before the end comes: the gospel will be preached throughout the world (14). Well, that and the abomination 
    of desolations will stand in the holy place (15), many false Christs and false prophets will show great signs and wonders (24), the sun and moon 
    will be darkened and the stars will fall (29), the sign of the son of Man will appear in the sky, everyone on earth will mourn, and then, 
    finally, the great and powerful son of Man will come in all his glory (30).
    
    <p>Oh, and all these things will happen within the lifespan of Jesus' contemporaries (34).
    
    <p>Or maybe not. Jesus was talking about things he knew nothing about (36). (See <a href="../mk/13.html#32">Mark 13:32</a>.)
  <a href="../mt/24.html#3">24:3-51</a>

<p><li>Jesus had no problem with the idea of drowning everyone on earth in the flood. It'll be just like that when he 
returns. <a href="../mt/24.html#37">24:37</a>

<p><li>God will come when people least expect him and then he'll "cut them asunder." And "there shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth."  <a href="../mt/24.html#50">24:50-51</a>

<p><li>The parable of the cruel and unjust master<br>
The kingdom of heaven is like a rich man who distributed his wealth to his servants while he traveled. He gave 
five talents (a talent was a unit of money, worth about 20 years of a worker's wages) to one servant, two to another, 
and one to a third. When he returned, the servant with five talents had made five more, the servant with two made two more,
 but the servant with one talent only had the talent his master entrusted to him. The master rewarded the servants that 
 invested his money (without his permission -- what would have happened if the stock market went down during their 
 master's travels?) and took the talent from the single-talent servant and gave it to the one with ten talents. "For 
 unto every one that hath shall be given .. but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath." 
 Then the cruel and unjust master cast the servant who carefully protected his master's talent into the "outer darkness: 
 [where] there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth." <a href="../mt/25.html#14">25:14-30</a>

<p><li>The servant who kept and returned his master's talent was cast into the "outer darkness" where there will be
"weeping and gnashing of teeth."  <a href="../mt/25.html#30">25:30</a>

<p><li>Jesus judges the nations. <a href="../mt/25.html#31">25:31-46</a>


<p><li>Jesus tells us what he has planned for those that he dislikes. They will be cast into an "everlasting fire." 
 <a href="../mt/25.html#41">25:41</a>
 
<p><li>Jesus says the damned will be tormented forever.  <a href="../mt/25.html#46">25:46</a>

<p><b><a href="../mk/cr_list.html">Mark</a></b>


<p><li>Jesus explains why he speaks in parables: to confuse people so they will go to hell. 
 <a href="../mk/4.html#11">4:11-12</a>
 
<p><li>Jesus sends devils into 2000 pigs, causing them to jump off a cliff and be drowned in the sea. When the people
hear about it, they beg Jesus to leave.  <a href="../mk/5.html#12">5:12-13</a>

<p><li>Any city that doesn't "receive" the followers of Jesus will be destroyed in a manner even more savage than that of
Sodom and Gomorrah.  <a href="../mk/6.html#11">6:11</a>

<p><li>Jesus criticizes the Jews for not killing their disobedient children as required by Old Testament 
law. (See <A href="../ex/21.html#15">Ex 21:15</A>, <A href="../lev/20.html#9">Lev 20:9</A>, <A
href="../dt/21.html#18">Dt 21:18-21</A>) <a href="../mk/7.html#9">7:9-10</a>

<p><li>Jesus tells us to cut off our hands and feet, and pluck out our eyes to avoid going to hell. 
 <a href="../mk/9.html#43">9:43-49</a>
 
<p><li>God is like a rich man who owns a 
	vineyard and rents it to poor farmers. When he sends servants to collect the rent, the tenants beat or kill them. So 
	he sent his son to collect the rent, and they kill him too. Then the owner comes and kills the farmers and gives the 
	vineyard to others. <a href="../mk/12.html#1">12:1-9</a>
	
<p><li>Jesus tells his disciples to eat his body and drink his blood.  <a href="../mk/14.html#22">14:22-24</a>

<p><li>Jesus says that those that believe and are baptized will be saved, while those who don't 
will be damned. <a href="../mk/16.html#16">16:16</a>

<p><b><a href="../lk/cr_list.html">Luke</a></b>


<p><li>Zechariah asks the angel Gabriel how his wife Elizabeth could become pregnant, since she is "stricken with years." 
Gabriel makes him "dumb" just for asking. <a href="../lk/1.html#20">1:20</a>

<p><li>Those who fail to bear "good fruit" will be "hewn down, and cast into the fire."  <a href="../lk/3.html#9">3:9</a>

<p><li>John the Baptist says that Christ will burn the damned "with fire unquenchable."  <a href="../lk/3.html#17">3:17</a>

<p><li>Jesus heals a naked man who was possessed by many devils by sending the devils into a herd of pigs, causing them to run off
a cliff and drown in the sea. This messy, cruel, and expensive (for the owners of the pigs) treatment did not favorably
impress the local residents, and Jesus was asked to leave.  <a href="../lk/8.html#27">8:27-37</a>

<p><li>Jesus says that entire cities will be violently destroyed and the inhabitants "thrust down to hell" for not
"receiving" his disciples.  <a href="../lk/10.html#10">10:10-15</a>

<p><li>Jesus says that we should fear God since he has the power to kill us and then torture us forever in hell. 
 <a href="../lk/12.html#5">12:5</a>
 
<p><li>Jesus says that God is like a slave-owner who beats his slaves "with many stripes."  
<a href="../lk/12.html#46">12:46-47</a>

<p><li>"Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish." <a href="../lk/13.html#3">13:3, 5</a>

<p><li>According to Jesus, only a few will be saved; the vast majority will suffer eternally in hell where "there shall be 
weeping and gnashing of teeth."  <a href="../lk/13.html#23">13:23-30</a>

<p><li>In the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, the rich man goes to hell, because as Abraham explains, he had a
good life on earth and so now he will be tormented. Whereas Lazarus, who was miserable on earth, is now in heaven.
This seems fair to Jesus.  <a href="../lk/16.html#19">16:19-31</a>

<p><li>  Jesus believed the story of Noah's ark. He thought it really happened and had no problem with 
  the idea of God drowning everything and everybody. <a href="../lk/17.html#26">17:26-27</a>
  
<p><li>Jesus also believes the story about Sodom's destruction. He says, "even thus shall it be in
the day the son of man is revealed ... Remember Lot's wife." This tells us about Jesus' knowledge of science and
history, and his sense of justice.  <a href="../lk/17.html#29">17:29-32</a>

<p><li>In the parable of the talents, Jesus says that God takes what is not rightly his, and reaps what he didn't sow.
The parable ends with the words: "bring them [those who preferred not to be ruled by him] hither, and slay
them before me."  <a href="../lk/19.html#22">19:22-27</a>

<p><li>Jesus tells his disciples to eat his body and drink his blood. <a href="../lk/22.html#19">22:19-20</a>

<p><b><a href="../jn/cr_list.html">John</a></b>


<p><li>Jesus believed the stupid and vicious story from <a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/num/21.html#4">Numbers 21</a>. 
(God sent snakes to bite the people for complaining about the lack of food and water. 
Then God told Moses to make a brass snake to cure them from the bites.)  <a href="../jn/3.html#14">3:14</a>

<p><li>"God so loved the world, that he gave his His only begotten Son."<br>
As an example to parents everywhere and to save the world (from himself), God had his own son tortured and killed. <a href="../jn/3.html#16">3:16</a>
 
<p><li>People are damned or saved depending only on what they believe. <a href="../jn/3.html#18">3:18</a>, 
<a href="../jn/3.html#36">36</a>

<p><li>The "wrath of God" is on all unbelievers.  <a href="../jn/3.html#36">3:36</a>

<p><li>Jesus believes people are crippled by God as a punishment for sin. He tells a crippled man, after healing him, to
