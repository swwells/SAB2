    Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, is
&quot;defiled&quot; by a man who seems to love her dearly. Her brothers trick
all of the men of the town and kill them (after first having them all
circumcised), and then take their wives and children captive.

<i>What did Dinah want?</i><br>
There is one voice that is entirely missing from this story: Dinah's. Did she love Shechem? 
Did she want to marry him? Or did she want him killed? Was this a Romeo/Juliet-type story, with two young lovers
willing to overlook their cultural and religious differences in order to be together? We'll ever know since it was of no 
interest to the biblical author. 

<p>By slaying Shechem, Dinah's brothers condemned her to a celibate life, since non-virgin women were 
not permitted to marry. (<a href="../dt/22.html#13">Dt.22:13-21</a>)

<i>"Lord, God of my forefather Simeon! You put a sword into his hand."</i> 
-- <a href="http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/judith/judith9.htm">Judith 9:2</a><br>
According to the Apocryphal/Deuterocanonical book of Judith, God not only approved of the violence 
in Genesis 34, he gave Simeon the sword that he used to kill all the males in the city.

  <tr><td><B><A name="20">34:20</A></B>

<p>(34:31) <i>"And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?"</i><br>
Dinah's brothers, to justify the massacre of a town for the rape of their sister, say: &quot;Should he deal with our sister
as with a harlot?&quot; To the author of Genesis, rape is a crime
against the honor of men rather than against a woman.
