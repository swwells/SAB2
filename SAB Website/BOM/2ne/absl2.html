'Joseph Smith got a little carried away with the fruit of various loins. In a single chapter (3) he mentions "fruit of my (his or thy) loins" 21 times. Verse 12 must set an all time record for fruits of loins: 5. <a href="index.html#3:4">3:4</a>, <a href="index.html#3:5">5</a>, <a href="index.html#3:6">6</a>, <a href="index.html#3:7">7</a>(3), <a href="index.html#3:11">11</a>(2), <a href="index.html#3:12">12</a>(5), <a href="index.html#3:14">14</a>, <a href="index.html#3:18">18</a>(4), <a href="index.html#3:19">19</a>(2), <a href="index.html#3:21">21</a>',
'Joseph Smith makes some modest prophecies about himself. He will be  a choice seer, esteemed highly, and shall do "a work of great worth." He will be great in God\'s eyes, like Moses, and will do God\'s work. He will bring forth God\'s word, confound false doctrines, establish peace, and bring knowledge in the latter days. All those who seek to destroy him will be confounded. He will be like God and will bring God\'s people to salvation. He will have exceeding faith, work mighty wonders, and do what is great in the sight of God. <a href="index.html#3:6">3:6-24</a>',
'Nephi brought along the brass plates and the magic ball (or compass) that God made with his own hands. This was about 1600 years before compasses were used in navigation. <a href="index.html#5:12">5:12</a>',
'Nephi teaches his followers to build buildings and work in iron, copper, brass, steel, gold, and silver. But evidence is lacking for such pre-Columbian metallurgy, and it would be well beyond the capabilities of a handful of immigrants from the ancient Near-East around 590 BCE. <a href="index.html#5:15">5:15</a>',
'The Nephites built a temple, like Solomon\'s but with not quite as many precious things. According to the bible (2 Chr.2:2), it took 150,000 men seven years to build the temple, but Nephites crew of a dozen or so men managed just fine. <a href="index.html#5:16">5:16</a>',
'And kings shall be thy nursing fathers. <a href="index.html#6:7">6:7</a>',
'The kings of the Gentiles shall be nursing fathers. <a href="index.html#10:9">10:9</a>',
'America was consecrated by God to the seed of Nephi (Mormons). God likes America better than any other country. All Americans will someday worship God. (And become Mormons?) <a href="index.html#10:19">10:19</a>',
'Nephi says he\'s going to include some more words of Isaiah, (He\'s already included about 5 chapters. See <a href="../1ne/index.html#17:39">1 Ne.17:39</a>, <a href="../1ne/index.html#20:1">20:1-22</a>, <a href="../1ne/index.html#21:1">21:1-21</a>; <a href="index.html#6:5">2 Ne.6:5-7</a>, <a href="index.html#6:16">6:16-18</a>, <a href="index.html#7:1">7:1-11</a>, <a href="index.html#8:1">8:1-25</a>, <a href="index.html#9:50">9:50-51</a>, <a href="index.html#10:9">10:9</a>) because his "soul delighteth in his words." So he throws in another 13 chapters or so. <a href="index.html#11:2">11:2</a>',
'God will make sweet smelling things stink and people with hair, bald. <a href="index.html#13:24">13:24</a>',
'"The Lord shall hiss for the fly ... and for the bee." <a href="index.html#17:18">17:18</a>',
'"The Lord [will] shave with a razor ... the head and hair of the feet," where "hair" and "feet" are biblical euphemisms for pubic hair and male sexual organs, respectively. <a href="index.html#17:20">17:20</a>',
'Isaiah has sex with a prophetess who conceives and bears a son. (You weren\'t expecting a daughter, were you?) God then tells Isaiah to call his name Mathershalalhashbaz. (It has a nice ring to it, doesn\'t it?) <a href="index.html#18:3">18:3</a>',
'God will "smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall slay the wicked." God must have some pretty bad breath! <a href="index.html#21:4">21:4</a>',
'"The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb...." I wonder what will become of the spiders. Will they be more friendly toward flies? And will the parasitic wasps find another way to feed their larvae? Or will they continue to feed off the living bodies of caterpillars? <a href="index.html#21:6">21:6</a>',
'"And  the weaned child shall put his hand in the cockatrice\' den." A cockatrice is a serpent, hatched from a cock\'s egg, that can kill with a glance. They are rare nowadays. <a href="index.html#21:8">21:8</a>',
'When God gets really angry, he causes earthquakes. <a href="index.html#23:13">23:13</a>',
'Dragons will live in Babylonian palaces and satyrs will dance there. <a href="index.html#23:21">23:21-22</a>',
'"Out of the serpent\'s root shall come forth a <i>cockatrice</i>, and his fruit shall be a <i>fiery flying serpent</i>." What ever happened to these fascinating biblical creatures? <a href="index.html#24:29">24:29</a>',
'Nephi\'s "soul delighteth in in the words of Isaiah." That\'s probably why he included 13 consecutive chapters from Isaiah. (2 Ne.12-24) <a href="index.html#25:5">25:5</a>',
'The Lord "will proceed to do a marvelous work and a wonder" (The Book of Mormon). <a href="index.html#25:17">25:17</a>',
'Joseph Smith (or Nephi) repeats the bible stories about the fiery serpents (<a href="../../num/21.html#6">Num. 21:6-9</a>) and the water-bearing rock (<a href="../../ex/17.html#6">Ex.17:6</a>, <a href="../../num/20.html#11">Num.20:11</a>). He figures that if you believe those stories, you\'ll believe his as well. <a href="index.html#25:20">25:20</a>',
'God will destroy (in varous ways) those who "dwindle in unbelief." <a href="index.html#26:15">26:15</a>',
'God won\'t give good stuff to those who "dwindle in unbelief." <a href="index.html#26:17">26:17</a>',
'God will get the Gentiles to kill all those who "dwindle in unbelief." <a href="index.html#26:19">26:19</a>',
'The devil is the founder of all those "secret combinations." <a href="index.html#26:22">26:22</a>',
'People should work for Zion (the Mormon church) not for money. <a href="index.html#26:31">26:31</a>'
