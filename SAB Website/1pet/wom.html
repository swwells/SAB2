<p><li>Peter orders all wives to be "in subjection" to their husbands. <a href="3.html#1">3:1</a>

<p><li>Wives are to use "chaste conversation, coupled with fear." They are not to braid their hair, wear gold, or put on
any "apparel." They are to do these things in imitation of the "holy" women of the Old testament who were "in
subjection to their won husbands: even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him Lord." <a href="3.html#2">3:2-6</a>

<p><li>In relation to her husband, the wife is "the weaker vessel." <a href="3.html#7">3:7</a>
