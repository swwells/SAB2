<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32"> (19:1) <br>
It's hard to keep track of all the plates in the Book of Mormon. 

<p>Remember the the plates of Lehi? The ones that 
<a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2010/06/1-nephi-3-oh-my-heck-we-forgot-brass.html" title="1 Nephi 3: O my heck! We forgot the brass plates!">Lehi 
forgot when he left Jerusalem</a>, so he had to send his sons back get them? Lehi's plates were so important to God 
that <a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2010/06/1-neph-4-better-for-one-man-to-die-than.html" title="1 Neph 4: Better for one man to die than a whole nation dwindle in unbelief">he 
sent an angel to force Nephi to decapitate an unconscious man</a> so he could steal his plates.

<p>Then came the plates of Nephi: two separate sets of plates, both 
confusingly <a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2010/07/1-nephi-9-nephi-names-his-plates.html" title="1 Nephi 9: Nephi names his plates">named 
by Nephi "the plates of Nephi."</a> One for "the more part of the ministry" and the other "for the more part of the reign of the kings 
and the wars and contentions."

<p>And now, God tells Nephi to make another set. I guess you just can't have too many plates.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that the Lord commanded me, wherefore I did make plates of ore."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32"> (19:2-5) On his third set of plates, Nephi only included the "more plain and 
precious parts," leaving out any unnecessary words, as you'd expect from someone engraving on plates of ore.

<p><i>"The more part of all our proceedings in the wilderness are engraven upon those 
first plates of which I have spoken; wherefore, the things which transpired before I made these plates are, of a truth, more particularly 
made mention upon the first plates. And after I had made these plates by way of commandment, I, Nephi, received a commandment that the 
ministry and the prophecies, <b>the more plain and precious parts</b> of them, <b>should be written upon these plates</b>; and that the 
things which were written should be kept for the instruction of my people ... and also for other wise purposes, 
which purposes are known unto the Lord. Wherefore, I, Nephi, did make a record upon the other plates ...  and that these plates should be 
handed down from one generation to another, or from one prophet to 
another, until further commandments of the Lord. And an account of my making these plates shall be given hereafter."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" border="0" width="32" height="32"> (19:6a) <br>
Nephi didn't write anything on the plates unless it was sacred. 

<p><i>"I do not write anything upon plates save it be that I think it be sacred."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" border="0" width="32" height="32">
<img src="../../images/contra1.gif"> (19:6b) <br>
Nephi says that whatever he wrote on the plates was sacred. But he 
admits that he might make some mistakes, just like they (the guys who 
wrote the Bible) did. Not that he's making any excuses, of course. <br>
<a href="../contra/true.html">Is the Book of Mormon true?</a>

<p><i>"And now, if I do err, even did they err of old; not that I would excuse myself because of other men."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/pr1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32"> (19:8) Then Nephi starts in again with prophecy, repeating the same stuff 
he's already told us several times before. (<a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/BOM/1ne/10.html#4">1 Nephi 10:4</a>, 
<a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/BOM/1ne/11.html#18">11:18</a>, 
<a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/BOM/1ne/13.html#40">13:40</a>)

<p>Jesus will be born 600 years after Lehi and his family left Jerusalem (and 592 years after Nephi wrote the prophecy 
down in his little brass book.)

<p><i>"And behold he cometh, according to the words of the angel, in six hundred years from the time my father left Jerusalem."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/pr1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32"> (19:10) But at least he does throw in a few new names. Zenock, Neum, and Zenos -- 
Old Testament prophets whose writings were removed by <a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/BOM/1ne/13.html#6" 
title="1 Nephi 13:6">that great and abominable church founded by the devil</a>. (You know, the Catholics.) 

<p>Anyway, Zenock, Neum, and Zenos knew all about Jesus. He'd be crucified, buried in a sepulchre, and after his death, there'd be 
three days of darkness.

<p><i>"According to the words of Zenock, and to be crucified, according to the words of Neum, and to be buried 
in a sepulchre, according to the words of Zenos, which he spake concerning the three days of darkness, which should be a sign given of 
his death unto those who should inhabit the isles of the sea, more especially given unto those who are of the house of Israel."</i>

<p>Three days of darkness? Yeah, that's what Zenos prophesied. The entire earth would be completely dark for three days after Jesus' 
death (See <a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/BOM/3ne/8.html#20">3 Nephi 8:20-22</a> and 
<a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/BOM/hel/14.html#27">Helaman 14:27</a> for the exciting details), as a sign to 
Lehi's descendants in "the isles of the sea" (the Lamanites in America and Polynesia). 

<p>Of course that's not what the Bible says. <a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/mt/27.html#45" 
title="SAB: Matthew 27:45">Matthew</a>, <a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/mk/15.html#33" 
title="SAB: Mark 15:33">Mark</a>, and <a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/lk/23.html#44" 
title="SAB: Luke 23:44">Luke</a> say it was dark for three hours just before Jesus died. (It's one of the few things those three 
guys agree on.) But that's because <a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/BOM/1ne/13.html#26" title="1 Nephi 13:26">the 
evil Catholics changed the plain and precious parts of the Bible</a>.

<p><img src="../../images/pr1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32">  (19:11-12) Zenos prophesied further that mountains would be carried away 
after Jesus died, along with lots of other nutty stuff. (See <a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/BOM/3ne/8.html">3 Nephi 8</a> where 
cities sunk, mountains were moved and dumped upon cities, etc.)

<p><i>"For thus spake the prophet: The Lord God surely shall visit ... others with the thunderings and the lightnings of his power, 
by tempest, by fire, and by smoke, and vapor of darkness, and by the opening of the earth, and by mountains which shall be carried up ... 
saith the prophet Zenos. And the rocks of the earth must rend; and ... many of the kings of the isles of the sea shall be wrought upon 
by the Spirit of God."</i>

<img src="../../images/int.gif" width="32" height="32"> 
<img src="../../images/inj1.gif" width="32" height="32"> (19:13-14) Then Zenos explains how all kinds of bad stuff would happen to the 
Jews because they "crucify the God of Israel." They'd be hated by all nations, wander in the flesh, etc.

<p><i>"They shall be scourged by all people, because they crucify the God of 
Israel ... and have despised the Holy One of Israel, they shall wander in the flesh, and perish, and 
become a hiss and a byword, and be hated among all nations."</i>

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32"> (19:22-23) And finally, Nephi says he's going to swipe a couple of chapters from 
the book of Isaiah as a bit of filler for his plates of brass.

<p><i>"Now it came to pass that I, Nephi, did teach my brethren these things; And it came to pass that I did read many things to them, 
which were engraven upon the plates of brass ...  And ... I did read unto them that which was written by the prophet Isaiah."</i>

<tr><td><b><a name="2">19:2</b></a>   And I knew not at the time when I made them that I should be 
commanded of the Lord to make these plates; wherefore, the record of my father, and the 
genealogy of his fathers, and <span class="a">the more part of all our proceedings in the wilderness are 
engraven upon those first plates of which I have spoken; wherefore, the things which 
transpired before I made these plates are, of a truth, more particularly made mention upon 
the first plates. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="3">19:3</b></a>  <span class="a">And after I had made these plates by way of commandment, I, Nephi, 
received a commandment that the ministry and the prophecies, the more plain and precious 
parts of them, should be written upon these plates; and that the things which were written 
should be kept for the instruction of my people</span>, who should possess the land, <span class="a">and also for 
other wise purposes, which purposes are known unto the Lord. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="4">19:4</b></a>   <span class="a">Wherefore, I, Nephi, did make a record upon the other plates</span>, which 
gives an account, or which gives a greater account of the wars and contentions and 
destructions of my people.  And this have I done, and commanded my people what they should 
do after I was gone; <span class="a">and that these plates should be handed down from one generation to 
another, or from one prophet to another, until further commandments of the Lord.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="5">19:5</b></a>  <span class="a"> And an account of my making these plates shall be given hereafter</span>; and 
then, behold, I proceed according to that which I have spoken; and this I do that the more 
sacred things may be kept for the knowledge of my people. 

<tr><td><b><a name="6">19:6</b></a>   Nevertheless, <span class="a">I do not write anything 
upon plates save it be that I think it be sacred.  And now, if I do err, even did they err 
of old; not that I would excuse myself because of other men</span>, but because of the weakness 
which is in me, according to the flesh, I would excuse myself. 

<tr><td><b><a name="7">19:7</b></a>   For the things which some men esteem to be of great worth, both to the 
body and soul, others set at naught and trample under their feet.  Yea, even the very God 
of Israel do men trample under their feet; I say, trample under their feet but I would 
speak in other words -- they set him at naught, and hearken not to the voice of his 
counsels. 

<tr><td><b><a name="8">19:8</b></a>   <span class="a">And behold he cometh, according to the words of the angel, in six 
hundred years from the time my father left Jerusalem.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="9">19:9</b></a>   And the world, because of their iniquity, shall judge him to be a 
thing of naught; wherefore they scourge him, and he suffereth it; and they smite him, and 
he suffereth it.  Yea, they spit upon him, and he suffereth it, because of his loving 
kindness and his long-suffering towards the children of men. 

<tr><td><b><a name="10">19:10</b></a>   And the God of our fathers, who were led out of Egypt, out of bondage, 
and also were preserved in the wilderness by him, yea, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, 
and the God of Jacob, yieldeth himself, according to the words of the angel, as a man, 
into the hands of wicked men, to be lifted up, <span class="a">according to the words of 
Zenock, and to be crucified, according to the words of Neum, and to be buried in a sepulchre, according to 
the words of Zenos, which he spake concerning the three days of darkness, which should be 
a sign given of his death unto those who should inhabit the isles of the sea, more 
especially given unto those who are of the house of Israel.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="11">19:11</b></a>   <span class="a">For thus spake the prophet: The Lord God surely shall visit</span> all the 
house of Israel at that day, some with his voice, because of their righteousness, unto 
their great joy and salvation, and others <span class="a">with the thunderings and the lightnings of his 
power, by tempest, by fire, and by smoke, and vapor of darkness, and by the opening of 
the earth, and by mountains which shall be carried up. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="12">19:12</b></a>   And all these things must surely come, <span class="a">saith the prophet Zenos.  And 
the rocks of the earth must rend; and </span>because of the groanings of the earth,<span class="a"> many of the 
kings of the isles of the sea shall be wrought upon by the Spirit of God</span>, to exclaim: The 
God of nature suffers. 

<tr><td><b><a name="13">19:13</b></a>   And as for those who are at Jerusalem, 
saith the prophet, <span class="int">they shall be scourged by all people, because they crucify the God of 
Israel</span>, and turn their hearts aside, rejecting signs and wonders, and the power and glory 
of the God of Israel. 

<tr><td><b><a name="14">19:14</b></a>   And because they turn their hearts aside, 
saith the prophet, <span class="int">and have despised the Holy One of Israel, they shall wander in the 
flesh, and perish, and become a hiss and a byword, and be hated among all nations. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="15">19:15</b></a>   Nevertheless, when that day cometh, saith the prophet, that they no 
more turn aside their hearts against the Holy One of Israel, then will he remember the 
covenants which he made to their fathers. 

<tr><td><b><a name="16">19:16</b></a>   Yea, then will he remember the isles of the sea; yea, and all the 
people who are of the house of Israel, will I gather in, saith the Lord, according to the 
words of the prophet Zenos, from the four quarters of the earth. 

<tr><td><b><a name="17">19:17</b></a>   Yea, and all the earth shall see the salvation of the Lord, saith the 
prophet; <span class="plag">every nation, kindred, tongue and people</span> shall be blessed. 

<tr><td><b><a name="18">19:18</b></a>   And I, Nephi, have written these things unto my people, that perhaps 
I might persuade them that they would remember the Lord their Redeemer. 

<tr><td><b><a name="19">19:19</b></a>   Wherefore, I speak unto all the house of Israel, if it so be that 
they should obtain these things. 

<tr><td><b><a name="20">19:20</b></a>   For behold, I have workings in the spirit, which doth weary me even 
that all my joints are weak, for those who are at Jerusalem; for had not the Lord been 
merciful, to show unto me concerning them, even as he had prophets of old, I should have 
perished also. 

<tr><td><b><a name="21">19:21</b></a>   And he surely did show unto the prophets of old all things concerning 
them; and also he did show unto many concerning us; wherefore, it must needs be that we 
know concerning them for they are written upon the plates of brass. 

<tr><td><b><a name="22">19:22</b></a>   <span class="a">Now it came to pass that I, Nephi, did teach my 
brethren these things; And it came to pass that I did read many 
things to them, which were engraven upon the plates of brass</span>, that they might know 
concerning the doings of the Lord in other lands, among people of old. 

<tr><td><b><a name="23">19:23</b></a>   <span class="a">And</span> I did read many things unto them which were written in the books 
of Moses; but that I might more fully persuade them to believe in the Lord their Redeemer 
<span class="a">I did read unto them that which was written by the prophet Isaiah</span>; for I did liken all 
scriptures unto us, that it might be for our profit and learning. 

<tr><td><b><a name="24">19:24</b></a>   Wherefore I spake unto them, saying: Hear ye the words of the prophet, 
ye who are a remnant of the house of Israel, a branch who have been broken off; hear ye the 
words of the prophet, which were written unto all the house of Israel, and liken them unto 
yourselves, that ye may have hope as well as your brethren from whom ye have been broken 
off; for after this manner has the prophet written.
