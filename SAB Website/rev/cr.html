<p><li>Jesus "washed us ... with his own blood." <a href="1.html#5">1:5</a>

<p><li>Everyone on earth will wail because of Jesus. <a href="1.html#7">1:7</a>

<p><li>Jesus has "the keys of hell and death." <a href="1.html#18">1:18</a>

<p><li>Repent -- or else Jesus will fight you with the sword that sticks out of his mouth. (Like the limbless knight in
Monty Python's "Holy Grail.") <a href="2.html#16">2:16</a>

<p><li>"I [Jesus] will kill her children with death."  <a href="2.html#23">2:23</a>

<p><li>"Thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created." God created parasites, 
pathogens, and predators for his very own pleasure. One of his favorite species is 
<a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2006/06/gods-fiery-serpents.html">guinea worms</a>. <a href="4.html#11">4:11</a>

 <a href="6.html#4">6:4</a>

population with the sword, starvation, and "with the beasts of the earth." <a href="6.html#8">6:8</a>

<p><li>The martyrs just can't wait until everyone else is slaughtered. God gives them a white robe 
and tells them to wait until he's done with his killing spree. <a href="6.html#10">6:10-11</a>

<p><li>God tells his murderous angels to "hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants
of your God on their foreheads." This verse is one that Christians like to use to show God's loving concern for the
environment. But the previous verse (<a href="7.html#2">7:2</a>) makes it clear that it was their God-given job to "hurt the earth and the sea"
just as soon as they finished their forehead marking job. <a href="7.html#3">7:3</a>

but only those men which have not the seal of God on their foreheads." God tells his angels not to kill them, but rather
torment them with scorpions for five months. Those tormented will want to die, but God won't let them. 
<a href="9.html#4">9:4-6</a>

<p><li>God makes some horse-like locusts with human heads, women's hair, lion's teeth, and scorpion's tails. They

<p><li>Four angels, with an army of 200 million, killed a third of the earth's population. <a href="9.html#15">9:15-19</a>

<p><li> Anyone that messes with God's two olive trees and 
two candlesticks (God's witnesses) will be burned to death by fire that comes out of their mouths.
 <a href="11.html#3">11:3-5</a>
 
<p><li>God's witnesses have special powers. They can shut up heaven so that it cannot rain, turn rivers

and shall send gifts to one another." After another three and half days God brings his witnesses back to life and they ascend into heaven. 
<a href="11.html#8">11:8-12</a>
 
<p><li>When the witnesses ascend into heaven, an earthquake kills 7000 men. This was the second woe. "The 
third woe cometh quickly." <a href="11.html#13">11:13-14</a>

<p><li>"The Lamb slain from the foundation of the world"<br>
God planned to kill Jesus before he created the world. <a href="13.html#8">13:8</a>

<p><li>Those who receive the mark of the beast will "drink of the wine of the wrath of God ... and shall be
tormented with fire and brimstone ... and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever."
 <a href="14.html#10">14:10-11</a>

<p><li>The seven vials of wrath: 1) sores, 2) sea turned to blood, 3) rivers turned to blood, 4) people scorched with
fire, 5) people gnaw their tongues in pain, 6) Euphrates dries up, 7) thunder, lightning, earthquake, and hail.
 <a href="16.html#1">16:1</a>
 
 <p><li>"There fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast." <a href="16.html#2">16:2</a>

 <a href="16.html#3">16:3</a>
 
 <p><li>"The third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; 
and they became blood." <a href="16.html#4">16:4</a>
 
<p><li>God gave the saints and prophets blood to drink. <a href="16.html#6">16:6</a>

<p><li>Another angel tells God how righteous he is because he gives saints blood to drink. <a href="16.html#7">16:7</a>

<p><li>"Power was given unto him [the fourth angel] to scorch men with fire." <a href="16.html#8">16:8</a>

<p><li>Those who were being burned to death by God didn't repent "to give him glory." <a href="16.html#9">16:9</a>

<p><li>"The fifth angel poured out his vial ... and they gnawed their tongues for pain." <a href="16.html#10">16:10</a>

<p><li>Even after being burned alive, those nasty people wouldn't repent! <a href="16.html#11">16:11</a>

<p><li>Christians will fight in the war between Jesus and those allied with the beast. <a href="17.html#14">17:14</a>

<p><li>"They shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire." (Are they going to eat her first and then 
burn her?) <a href="17.html#16">17:16-17</a>

<p><li>To punish her God will send plagues and famine, and "she will be utterly burned with fire."

<p><li>Jesus makes war. <a href="19.html#11">19:11</a>

<a href="19.html#13">19:13</a>

<p><li>With eyes aflame, many crowns on his head, clothes dripping with blood, a sword sticking out of his mouth, and a secret name, 
Jesus leads the faithful in heaven into holy war on earth.  <a href="19.html#14">19:14-15</a>
 
<p><li>"Come ... unto the supper of the great God." An angel calls all the fowls to feast
upon the flesh of dead horses and human bodies, "both free and bond, both small and great." 
 <a href="19.html#17">19:17-18</a>
 
<p><li>The beast and the false prophet are cast alive into a lake of fire. The rest were killed with the sword of
Jesus. "And all the fowls were filled with their flesh." <a href="19.html#20">19:20-21</a>
