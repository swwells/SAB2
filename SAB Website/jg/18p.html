The story begins with the tribe of Dan (one of the 12 tribes of Israel) looking for a nice place to live. So they sent out five men to find some land.

<p>(18:1) <i>"The Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in."</i>

<p>(18:2) <i>"And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts ... to spy out the land, and to search it."</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (18:3-6) On their way, they stopped at a Micah's house and asked his priest to ask God where they should go to find some land. The priest 
told them to just go looking for it, and that God would be with them wherever they went.

<p>(18:3) <i>"When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither."</i>

<p>(18:4) <i>"He said unto them ... Micah ... hath hired me, and I am his priest."</i>

<p>(18:5) <i>"They said unto him, Ask counsel ... of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous."</i>

<p><img src="../images/interp.gif"> (18:6) <i>"The LORD is your way wherein ye go."</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (18:7) So they left there and came to a place called Laish, where the people lived peaceful, secure, carefree lives.
</b>

<p>(18:7) <i>"The five men ... came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt careless, ... 
quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing."</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (18:8-10) Then the five men returned and told the other Danites to attack Laish, saying that God had given it into their hands.

<p>(18:8) <i>"They came unto their brethren ... and their brethren said unto them, What say ye?"</i>

<p>(18:9) <i>"And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good ... go, and ... possess the land."</i>

<p><img src="../images/interp.gif"> (18:10) <i>"When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large land: for <b>God hath given 
it into your hands</b>; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth."</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (18:11) So the Danites round up 600 soldiers and march off toward Laish.

<p>(18:11) <i>"There went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war."</i>

  In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of
    the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day all
    their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="2">18:2</A></B>
  And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts,
    men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to
    search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came
    to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="3">18:3</A></B>
  When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man
    the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee
    hither? and what makest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="4">18:4</A></B>
  And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired
    me, and I am his priest.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="5">18:5</A></B>
  And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may
    know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.

  And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before <span class="interp">the LORD is your way

  Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that
    were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians,
    quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put
    them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no
    business with any man.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="8">18:8</A></B>
  And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren
    said unto them, What say ye?

  And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the
    land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go,
    and to enter to possess the land.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="10">18:10</A></B>
  When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large land: for

  And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and
    out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="12">18:12</A></B>
  And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah: wherefore they
    called that place Mahanehdan unto this day: behold, it is behind
    Kirjathjearim.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="13">18:13</A></B>
  And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the house of
    Micah.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="14">18:14</A></B>
  Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and
    said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod,
    and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider
    what ye have to do.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="15">18:15</A></B>
  And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the
    Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and saluted him.

  And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which were of
    the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate.

  And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in
    thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the
    molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six
    hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved image, the

    them, What do ye?<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="19">18:19</A></B>
  And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and
    go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for thee to be
    a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe
    and a family in Israel?<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
