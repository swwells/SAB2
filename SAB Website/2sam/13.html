(13:1-22) David's family values<br>
Ammon (David's son) says to his half-sister
Tamar, "Come lie with me, my sister." But she resists. So he rapes her
and then sends her away. Tamar, knowing that she now belongs to him (since she
was a virgin), expects him to marry her, but he refuses.

    I may see it, and eat it at her hand.

The <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/nrs/2-samuel/13-21.html">New Revised Standard Version adds</a>, <i>"but he would not punish 
his son Amnon, because he loved him, for he was his firstborn."</i><br>
David loved Ammon "because he was his firstborn" (good parents love their firstborn sons more than their other kids). As 
<a href="http://www.thebricktestament.com/king_david/davids_son_rapes_davids_daughter/2s13_21b.html">the Brick Testament suggests</a>, 
he probably said something like, "Oh well, I guess firstborns are entitled to one free incestuous rape."

    
<p>(13:22)<br><i>"Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar."</i>
