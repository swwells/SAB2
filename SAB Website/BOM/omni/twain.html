<p>The author of the Book of Mormon tried hard to make it sound like the King James Bible. Way too 
hard, in fact. Here's what Mark Twain said about it:
<blockquote>Wherever he found his speech growing too modern -- which was about every sentence or two -- he ladled in 
a few such Scriptural phrases as "exceeding sore," "and it came to pass," etc., and made things satisfactory again. 
'And it came to pass' was his pet. If he had left that out, his Bible would have been only a pamphlet.
