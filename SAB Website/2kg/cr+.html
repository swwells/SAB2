<p><li>Ahaziah was sick and sent messengers to Baalzebub to ask if he would recover. God was jealous of the
attention given to his competitor and tells Ahaziah that he will die for asking the wrong god. 
 <a href="1.html#4">1:4, 17</a>
 
<p><li>Elijah shows that he is "a man of God" by burning 102 men to death.  <a href="1.html#9">1:9-12</a>

<p><li>God sends two bears to rip up 42 little children for making fun of Elisha's bald head.  <a href="2.html#23">2:23-24</a>

<p><li>Elisha not only can cure leprosy, he can also dish it out. Here he makes his servant (Gehazi) and all his
descendants lepers forever. <a href="5.html#27">5:27</a>

<p><li>"So we boiled my son, and did eat him." Women killed, boiled and ate their own
children because of a plague that God sent, or as the Bible puts it: "Behold, this evil is of the 
Lord." <a href="6.html#28">6:28-29, 33</a>

<p><li>A man is trampled to death for disbelieving Elisha. <a href="7.html#17">7:17-20</a>

<p><li>God sends a famine on the people that lasts for seven years.  <a href="8.html#1">8:1</a>

<p><li>God says that the "whole house of Ahab shall perish," and that he "will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against
the wall."  <a href="9.html#8">9:8</a>

<p><li>"And the dogs shall eat Jezebel ... and there shall be none to bury her." <a href="9.html#10">9:10</a>

<p><li>God has Jezebel thrown off a wall. Her blood is sprinkled on the wall and on the horses, by which she is
trampled. Her body is eaten by dogs and all that remains of it is her hands, feet, and skull. God says that she "shall be
as dung upon the face of the field."  <a href="9.html#33">9:33-37</a>

<p><li>All seventy of king Ahab's sons are killed, their heads put in baskets, and sent to Jezreel. He says, "Lay ye
them in two heaps ..."  <a href="10.html#7">10:7-8</a>

<p><li>Jehu shows off his zeal for the Lord by murdering "all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had
destroyed him according to the word of the Lord."  <a href="10.html#16">10:16-17</a>

<p><li>God is greatly pleased with all of Jehu's killings, saying "because thou hast done well in executing that which
is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart [Jehu murdered
them all], thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel."  <a href="10.html#30">10:30</a>

<p><li>The "Lord's people" destroyed the "house of Baal" and killed "the priest of Baal 
before the altars." <a href="11.html#17">11:17-18</a>

<p><li>Amaziah "did that which was right in the sight of the Lord" and killed ten thousand Edomites. 
<a href="14.html#3">14:3, 7</a>

<p><li>God strikes king Azariah with leprosy "unto the day of his death" for not removing the high places. 
 <a href="15.html#5">15:5</a>
 
<p><li>God sent lions to devour the foreigners in Samaria because "they feared not the Lord," and even worse
"they knew not the manner of the God of the land." Well that'll teach them about God's manners.  
<a href="17.html#25">17:25-26</a>

<p><li>An "angel of the Lord" kills 185,000 men while they sleep. "And when they arose early in the morning, behold,
they were all dead corpses." I guess they all woke up and said, "Shucks, I'm dead."  <a href="19.html#35">19:35</a>

<p><li>Josiah, apparently with God's approval, kills "all the priests of the high places" and sacrifices them to God on
their altars. Note that this is a guy who "did what was right in the eyes of the Lord" 
(<a href="22.html#2">2 Kings 22:2</a>).  <a href="23.html#20">23:20</a>
