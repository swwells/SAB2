<p><li>Joshua's spies visit and "came unto" a prostitute in Jericho. They weren't very discreet about it either, since 
    the King of Jericho soon found out about it. The king's officials ask Rahab to "bring forth the men 
    that are come to thee."  <a href="2.html#1">2:1-4</a>
    
<p><li>"And the city shall be accursed ... and all that therein, to the Lord: only Rahab the harlot shall live." 
<a href="6.html#17">6:17</a>

<p><li>"And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass,
with the edge of the sword."  <a href="6.html#21">6:21</a>

<p><li>After killing everyone, "they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein." Only the valuables (silver, gold, brass,
and iron) did they keep to "put into the treasury of the house of the Lord." <a href="6.html#24">6:24</a>

<p><li>Joshua says that those who try to rebuild Jericho will be accursed by God, and will have to sacrifice both their oldest
and their youngest sons in its construction. But Jericho still exists today, and is often considered to be the world's oldest,
continuously occupied city.  <a href="6.html#26">6:26</a>

<p><li>If you happen to see &quot;the accursed thing,&quot; don't touch it. If you do, you, your family, and all of your animals must 
be burned. <A href="7.html#15"  >7:15</A>

<p><li>"And Joshua ... took Achan ... and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his sheep... And all of Israel
stoned them with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones." This is because Achan "took
of the accursed thing" -- whatever that means. But why would God require that Achan's sons and daughters (and even his
animals) be stoned to death along with him? The Bible doesn't say. But it does tell us that "the Lord turned from the
fierceness of his anger" when Achan, his children, and his animals were stoned to death and their dead bodies burned. 
 <a href="7.html#24">7:24-26</a>

<p><li>"When Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field ... all the Israelites returned unto Ai, 
and smote it with the edge of the sword." <a href="8.html#24">8:24</a>

<p><li>"All that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand." <a href="8.html#25">8:25</a>

<p><li> Joshua, at God's command, kills everyone and everything that he can find (including babies and little children)--
or, as the Bible puts it, he "utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the Lord commanded."  <a href="10.html#28">10:28-32</a>

<p><li>"Joshua passed unto Eglon ... and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed." 
<a href="10.html#34">10:34-35</a>

<p><li>"Joshua went ... unto Hebron ... and smote it with the edge of the sword ... and all the cities ... and all the souls that were therein; 
he left none remaining." <a href="10.html#36">10:36-37</a>

<p><li>"Joshua returned ... to Debir ... And he took it ... and all the cities ... and they smote them with the edge of the sword, 
and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining."<a href="10.html#38">10:38-39</a>

<p><li>"So Joshua ... left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded."  
<a href="10.html#40">10:40</a>

<p><li>God delivers the Hazorites into Joshua's hand, and he knows just what to do with them: he smites them all with
(you guessed it) the edge of the sword until "there was not any left to breathe."  <a href="11.html#6">11:6-17</a>

<p><li>"And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe." 
<a href="11.html#11">11:11</a>

<p><li>"And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he utterly destroyed them, 
as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded." <a href="11.html#12">11:12</a>

<p><li>"Every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe." 
<a href="11.html#14">11:14</a>

<p><li>"Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities." <a href="11.html#21">11:21</a>

<p><li>Caleb offers to <i>give</i> his daughter to whoever conquers the city of Debir. Caleb's nephew wins the contest 
and is given his cousin for a prize. <a href="15.html#16">15:16-17</a>
