<img src="../../images/boring.jpg"  > (8:1-25) Jacob continues reading Isaiah to us. (Chapters <a href="../../is/51.html">51</a> and <a href="../../is/52.html">52</a>)

<p>(8:1) Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the LORD:
    look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence ye
    are digged. 

<br>(8:2) Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you: for I called
    him alone, and blessed him, and increased him. 

<br>(8:3) For the LORD shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places; and
    he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the
    LORD; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice
    of melody.
    
<br>(8:4) Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a law
    shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of
    the people. 

<br>(8:5) My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine arms shall
    judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on mine arm shall they
    trust.

<br>(8:6) Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the
    heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a
    garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my
    salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished. -- <a href="../../is/51.html#1">Isaiah 51:1-6</a>
    
<p><img src="../../images/cr1.gif"  > (8:6) "The heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a
    garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner." (God plans to destroy the universe.)    

<p>(8:7) Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is
    my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their
    revilings. 

<br>(8:8) For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them
    like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from
    generation to generation. 

<br>(8:9) Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the ancient
    days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab, and
    wounded the dragon? -- <a href="../../is/51.html#7">Isaiah 51:7-9</a>
    
    <p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"  >
<img src="../../images/sci1.gif"  > (8:9-10) 
	God cut <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahab_%28demon%29">Rahab</a> (the sea 
monster) to pieces, wounded the dragon, and dried up the sea.    

<p>(8:10) Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep;
    that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over? 7
    
<br>(8:11) Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing
    unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head: they shall obtain
    gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away. 

<br>(8:12) I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou shouldest be
    afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as
    grass; 

<br>(8:13) And forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens,
    and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually every day
    because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and
    where is the fury of the oppressor? 

<br>(8:14) The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he should not
    die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail. 

<br>(8:15) But I am the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared: The
    LORD of hosts is his name. 

<br>(8:16) And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the
    shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations
    of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people. 

<br>(8:17) Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the
    LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of
    trembling, and wrung them out. 

<p>(8:18) There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth;
    neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she
    hath brought up. 

<p>(8:19) These two things are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for thee?
    desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword: by whom shall I
    comfort thee? 

<p>(8:20) Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as a wild
    bull in a net: they are full of the fury of the LORD, the rebuke of thy God. 

<p>(8:21) Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine: 

<p>(8:22) Thus saith thy Lord the LORD, and thy God that pleadeth the cause of his
    people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, even
    the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it 
    again: 

<p>(8:23) But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which have said
    to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as
    the ground, and as the street, to them that went over. 

<p>(8:24) Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city:
    for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the
    unclean. 
    
<p>(8:25) Shake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem: loose
    thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion. -- <a href="../../is/52.html#10">Isaiah 51:10 - 52:2</a>
