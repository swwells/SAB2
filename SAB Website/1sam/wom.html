<p><li>"He [Samuel's father] had two wives." <a href="1.html#2">1:2</a>

<p><li>"The Lord had shut up her [Hannah's] womb." <a href="1.html#5">1:5</a>

<p><li>"And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the Lord remembered her." (He probably said something 
like, "Oh yeah, she's the one whose womb I shut up.") And Hannah conceived and "bare a son [Oh boy, 
another boy!], and called his name Samuel."  <a href="1.html#19">1:19-20</a>

<p><li>David and Saul have a contest to see who can kill the most people for God, and the women act as
cheerleaders saying, "Saul has killed his thousands, and David his tens of thousands."  
<a href="18.html#6">18:6-7</a>, <a href="21.html#11">21:11</a>, <a href="29.html#5">29:5</a>

<p><li>David kills 200 Philistines and brings their foreskins to Saul to buy his first wife (Saul's daughter Michal).
Saul had only asked for 100 foreskins, but David was feeling generous.  <a href="18.html#25">18:25-27</a>

<p><li>The priest tells David that he and his men can eat the "hallowed" bread if "they have kept themselves at least
from women." David assures the priest that they have and that "the vessels of the young men are holy." So it'd be OK
for them to eat the holy bread.  <a href="21.html#4">21:4-5</a>

<p><li>"And it came to pass about ten days after, that the Lord smote Nabal, that he died." This was convenient for
David who then took his property and his wife, Abigail.  <a href="25.html#38">25:38</a>

<p><li>"When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD ... And David sent and communed with Abigail, 
to take her to him to wife." <a href="25.html#39">25:39</a>

<p><li>David takes his second wife (Abigail) after God killed her husband (Nabal). He also, at the same time,
took another wife (#3), Abinam. In the meantime, Saul gave Michal (his daughter and David's first wife) to another
man.  <a href="25.html#41">25:41-44</a>

<p><li>"David rescued his two wives."<br>
Oh, goodie! David got his wives back!  <a href="30.html#18">30:18</a>
