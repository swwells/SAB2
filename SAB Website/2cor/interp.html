<p><li>"For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in
    our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the
    face of Jesus Christ."<br>
    <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/us-military-weapons-inscribed-secret-jesus-bible-codes/story?id=9575794">This 
    verse <strike>is</strike> was inscribed on US military rifle sights.</a> <a href="4.html#6">4:6</a>

<p><li>To Jehovah's Witnesses, everything outside of the Watchtower Organization 
is controlled by Satan. The Governing Body uses theses verses to 
condemn all holidays, civic activities, and association with non-JWs. <a href="6.html#14">6:14-17</a>

<p><li>"For your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men ... Thanks be to God."<br>
God loves liberals! <a href="9.html#13">9:13-15</a>

<p><li>Jehovah's Witnesses use this verse 
(along with <a href="../dt/19.html#15">Dt 19:15</a>, <a href="../1tim/5.html#19">1 Tim 5:19</a>, 
 and <a href="../mt/18.html#16">Mt 18:16</a>) 
to justify their refusal to report or investigate incidents of child molestation unless two or three 
JWs have witnessed the event. If witnesses do not come forward (and they are 
discouraged from doing so since it would embarrass the organization), then the 
victim is told to be quiet about it -- or risk being disfellowshipped. <a href="13.html#1">13:1</a>
