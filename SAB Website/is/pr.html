<p><li>God told Isaiah to tell Ahaz, the King of Judah, not to be concerned about Rezin (the king of Syria) or Pekah (the king of
Israel). But according to <a href="../2chr/28.html#5">2 Chr 28:5-6</a> "God delivered him [Ahaz] into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and
carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the
king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter."  <a href="7.html#3">7:3-7</a>

<p><li>The King James Version mistranslates the Hebrew word "almah", which means "young woman" as "virgin". (The Hebrew
word, "bethulah", means "virgin".) In addition, the young woman referred to in this verse was living at the time of the prophecy.
And Jesus, of course, was called Jesus -- and is not called Emmanuel in any verse in the New Testament.  
<a href="7.html#14">7:14</a>

<p><li>As a sign that he's getting ready to destroy the world, God will destroy the whole universe. <a href="13.html#10">13:10-13</a>

<p><li>These verses falsely predict that Babylon will never again be inhabited.  <a href="13.html#19">13:19-20</a>

<p><li>Dragons will live in Babylonian palaces and satyrs will dance there.  <a href="13.html#21">13:21-22</a>

<p><li>Every head will be bald, every beard will be shaved, and everyone will howl and weep abundantly. <a href="15.html#2">15:2-3</a>

<p><li>"Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl." <a href="16.html#7">16:7</a>

<p><li>"Within three years ... the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant 
shall be very small and feeble." <a href="16.html#14">16:14</a>

<p><li>This verse prophesies that Damascus will be completely destroyed and no longer be inhabited. Yet Damascus has never
been completely destroyed and is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities.  <a href="17.html#1">17:1</a>

<p><li>God will ride in on a cloud and scare the hell out of the Egyptians. <a href="19.html#1">19:1</a>

<p><li>The river of Egypt (identified as the Nile in RSV) shall dry up. This has never occurred.  <a href="19.html#5">19:5</a>

<p><li>"The land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt." Judah never invaded Egypt and was never a 
military threat to Egypt. <a href="19.html#17">19:17</a>

<p><li>This verse predicts that there shall be five cities in Egypt that speak the Canaanite language. But that language was never
spoken in Egypt, and it is extinct now.  <a href="19.html#18">19:18</a>

<p><li>These verses predict that the Egyptians will worship the Lord (Yahweh) with sacrifices and offerings. But Judaism has
never been an important religion in Egypt.  <a href="19.html#18">19:18-21</a>

<p><li>These verses predict that there will be an alliance between Egypt, Israel, and Assyria. But there has never been any
such alliance, and it's unlikely that it ever will since Assyria no longer exists.  <a href="19.html#23">19:23-24</a>

<p><li>"They have ... changed the ordinance. There is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, the mirth
    of the land is gone."<br>
    Is this a prophecy about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition#Prohibition_in_the_United_States">prohibition in 
    the United States</a>? <a href="24.html#5">24:5-11</a>

<p><li>"The priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink." You can't even trust a drunken prophet anymore.  
<a href="28.html#7">28:7</a>

<p><li>"Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation
    a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that
    believeth shall not make haste."<br>
Misquoted in <a href="../rom/9.html#33">Romans 9:33</a> as: "As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of
    offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed." <a href="28.html#16">28:16</a>

<p><li>"The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be
     sevenfold." Well, this is one prophecy that will never come true. Since the moon has no light of its own, but only 
     reflects that of the sun, it could never shine like the sun. And the sun will not, at least not while there are humans to see 
     it, shine 7 times as bright as it does now.  <a href="30.html#26">30:26</a>
     
     <p><li>"The host of heaven shall be dissolved ... and ... shall fall down."<br>
The stars will dissolve and fall from the sky. <a href="34.html#4">34:4</a>
     
<p><li>"Henceforth there shall no more come into thee [Jerusalem] the uncircumcised and the unclean." But many
uncircumcised people have visited and occupied Jerusalem after this prophecy was made. 
 <a href="52.html#1">52:1</a>
 
<p><li> Isaiah 53 is probably the most often used "prophecy" that is claimed by Christian apologists to 
refer to Jesus. <a href="http://www.godlesshaven.com/articles/isaiah53.html">But the context indicates otherwise.</a> The 
"suffering servant" that is referred to here is Israel, not Jesus. <a href="53.html#1">53:1-12</a> 
 
<p><li>Nations that do not serve Israel will perish.  <a href="60.html#12">60:12</a>

<p><li>"The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me."<br>
    These words were spoken by Isaiah and referred to Isaiah. They were not a prophecy about a future prophet, as Jesus 
     claimed in <a href="../lk/4.html#16">Luke 4:16-19</a>, where he supposedly read these verses in the synagogue while applying 
     them to himself.  <a href="61.html#1">61:1-2</a>
