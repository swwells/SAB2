<p><li>The author of this psalm allegedly is David. If so, then it's 
not surprising that his "loins" would be "filled with a loathsome disease." After all, his promiscuity 
was legendary, and he probably didn't practice safe sex.  <a href="38.html#5">38:5, 7</a>

<p><li>They [the heathen] make a noise like a dog .... Behold, they belch out with their mouths." These are good
reasons for God to kill them.  <a href="59.html#6">59:6-7, 14</a>

<p><li>God divides the world into those countries that he likes and those that he doesn't. 
Those he doesn't like he calls names (like "washpot") and says that he will throw his shoe at them. <a href="60.html#7">60:7-8</a>

<p><li>God will "wound the head of his enemies" so that the righteous can wash their feet "in the blood 
of thine enemies, and the tongue of thy dogs in the same."  <a href="68.html#21">68:21, 23</a>

<p><li>The psalmist prays that his enemies be tormented and blinded by God. He asks God to "make their loins
continually to shake."  <a href="69.html#23">69:23-28</a>

<p><li>"They that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee." <a href="73.html#27">73:27</a>

<p><li>The psalmist asks God to " do unto them as unto the Midianites ... which became as dung for the earth." 
 <a href="83.html#9">83:9-18</a>

<p><li>"Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions." <a href="106.html#39">106:39</a>
