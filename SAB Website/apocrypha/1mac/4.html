(4:59) <i>"Judas, and his brethren, and all the church of Israel decreed, that the day of the dedication of the altar should be kept 
in its season from year to year for eight days, from the five and twentieth day of the month of Casleu."</i><br>
This is the origin of the eight-day Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, which celebrates the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem.

any time come, and tread it down as they did before.
