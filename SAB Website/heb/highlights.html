<a href="9.html#26">9:26</a>, <a href="10.html#25">10.25</a>, <a href="10.html#37">10:37</a>

 <p><LI>Every skeptic and nonbeliever has "an evil heart of unbelief." <A href="3.html#12">3:12</A>
 
 <p><li>It is impossible for fallen-away Christians to be saved. (Didn't the author know about confession or the finality of being saved?) 
 <a href="6.html#4">6:4-6</a>
 
  <p><li>Apostates will burn in hell with the other non-believers. <a href="6.html#8">6:8</a>

 <p><li>Melchisedec had no father or mother. He was never born (he just appeared ready-made by God) and he never died. He's still around somewhere. 
  <a href="7.html#3">7:3</a>
  
  <p><LI>God will not forgive us unless we shed the blood of some innocent creature. <A href="9.html#13">9:13-22</A>
  
    <p><li>Those who disobeyed the Old Testament law were killed without mercy. It will be much worse for those who displease
Jesus.  <a href="10.html#28">10:28-29</a>

<p><li>"It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God." <a href="10.html#31">10:31</a>

<p><li>Faith is believing without evidence things that you wish were true (but aren't). <a href="11.html#1">11:1</a>

   <p><li>If you're not a Christian, it's impossible to please God. <a href="11.html#6">11:6</a>
   
   <p><li>"By faith Noah ... condemned the world." <a href="11.html#7">11:7</a>
   
   <p><li>"Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed." <a href="11.html#11">11:11</a>
   
   <p><li>"Abraham ... offered up Isaac ... his only begotten son." (To the author of Hebrews this was a good thing.) <a href="11.html#17">11:17</a>
   
   <p><li>Moses "kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them." <a href="11.html#28">11:28</a>
   
   <p><li>"By faith the walls of Jericho fell down." <a href="11.html#30">11:30</a>
   
   <p><li>"By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not." <a href="11.html#31">11:31</a>
    
     <p><li>The heroes of faith: Samson, Jephthah, David, and Samuel. It would be hard to find a more monstrous group than these guys. <a href="11.html#32">11:32</a>
     
     <p><li>"Others were tortured ... that they might obtain a better resurrection." <a href="11.html#35">11:35</a>
     
    <p><li>God always hurts the ones he loves. If he doesn't hurt you, you're a bastard, not a son. <a href="12.html#6">12:6-8</a>

<p><li>God ordered animals to be "stoned, or thrust through with a dart" if they "so much as ... touch the mountain."
 <a href="12.html#20">12:20</a>
 
 <p><LI>Avoid &quot;strange doctrines.&quot; Those who do so
    will avoid nearly everything in the Bible. <A href="13.html#9">13:9</A>
    
    <p><li>"Our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you."<br>
    The author of Hebrews never claims to be (and wasn't) Paul, but he wants people to think that he was. And it worked. That's why Hebrews is in the Bible.  <a href="13.html#23">13:23</a>
