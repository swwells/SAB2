 <font size="-1">
<img src="../images/interp.gif" > (6:3a) <i>"Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary?"</i><br>
This is the only verse in the New Testament where Jesus is referred to as a carpenter. And in the earliest manuscript of Mark, 
the verse says, "Is not this the son of the carpenter?" Apparently it wasn't in any of the Gospels at the time of Origen, 
who said that "in none of the Gospels current in the Churches is Jesus himself ever described as being a carpenter."

<p><img src="../images/interp.gif"> (6:3b) <i>"The brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us?"</i> 
Jesus had at least six siblings, four brothers and at least two sisters. Yet it is a doctrine of the Catholic church that Mary was always a virgin. 

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif" >
<img src="../images/contra1.gif" > (6:3c-5) <i>"They were offended at him ... and he could do there no mighty work."</i><br>
Jesus is rejected by those who knew him the best, the people from his home town of Nazareth.<br>
<A href="../contra/power.html">How much power did Jesus have?</a><br>
<A href="../contra/cando.html">Can God do anything?</a>

<p><img src="../images/contra1.gif" >
<img src="../images/abs1.gif" > (6:7) <i>"He called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and
    two; and gave them power over unclean spirits."</i><br>
Jesus sends out his apostles, two by two, to cast out "unclean spirits."

<p><img src="../images/contra1.gif" > (6:8-9) <i>"And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, 
save a staff only. But be shod with sandals."</i><br>
<A href="../contra/barefoot.html">Did Jesus tell his apostles to go barefoot and without a staff?</a>

<img src="../images/int.gif" > (6:11)<br>
<i>"Whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you.... It shall be more tolerable
    for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city."</i> Any city that doesn't &quot;receive&quot; the
followers of Jesus will be destroyed in a manner even more savage than that of
Sodom and Gomorrah.

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif" >
<img src="../images/sci1.gif" > (6:13) <br><i>"They cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick,
    and healed them."</i>
    
<font size="-1">
    <p><img src="../images/abs1.gif" > (6:14-15) There was much disagreement and confusion
about Jesus' identity. Some thought he was Elijah or one of the prophets. And
some (like Herod in this verse) thought he was the risen John the Baptist, even
though John had just recently died and the people must have known what he looked
like.

<p>(6:14) <i>"King Herod heard of him [Jesus] ...  and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead."</i>

<p>(6:15) <i>"Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets."</i>

he is risen from the dead."</i><br>

  And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and
