  Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul,
    and besought him,<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="3">25:3</A></B>
  And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem,

  Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me,

  And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto
    Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be
    brought.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="7">25:7</A></B>
  And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round
    about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could
    not prove.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="8">25:8</A></B>
  While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews,
    neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any
    thing at all.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="9">25:9</A></B>
  But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said,
    Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="10">25:10</A></B>
  Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be
    judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="11">25:11</A></B>
  For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I
    refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse
    me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="12">25:12</A></B>
  Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou
    appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="13">25:13</A></B>
  And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to
    salute Festus.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="14">25:14</A></B>
  And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto
    the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="15">25:15</A></B>
  About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of
    the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="16">25:16</A></B>
  To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man
    to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and
    have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="17">25:17</A></B>
  Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I
    sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="18">25:18</A></B>
  Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of
    such things as I supposed:<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="19">25:19</A></B>
  But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of
    one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="20">25:20</A></B>
  And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he
    would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="21">25:21</A></B>
  But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I
    commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="22">25:22</A></B>
  Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To
    morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="23">25:23</A></B>
  And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp,
    and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and
    principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="24">25:24</A></B>
  And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us,
    ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with
    me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any
    longer.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="25">25:25</A></B>
  But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that
    he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="26">25:26</A></B>
  Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have
    brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa,
    that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="27">25:27</A></B>
  For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to
    signify the crimes laid against him.
