<p><li>The sin of Sodom (homosexuality?) is evil.  <a href="13.html#9">13:9</a>

<p><li>"Wo unto them that ... follow strong drink ... and wine inflame them!" The Mormon church interprets this  
to be a condemnation of drinking alcohol. <a href="15.html#11">15:11</a>
 
<p><li>"Wherefore murmur ye, because that ye shall receive more of my word?"<br>
LDS apologists use this verse to justify the plagiarism of the Bible in the Book of Mormon. Both were inspired by God, why 
shouldn't they use the same words? <a href="29.html#8">29:8</a>
