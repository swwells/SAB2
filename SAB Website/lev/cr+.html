<p><li>God gives detailed instructions for performing ritualistic animal sacrifices. such bloody rituals
must be important to God, judging from the number of times that he repeats their instructions.
Indeed the entire first nine chapters of Leviticus can be summarized as follows: Get an animal,
kill it, sprinkle the blood around, cut the dead animal into pieces, and burn it for a "sweet savor
unto the Lord."  <a href="1.html#1">Chapters 1 - 9</a>

<p><li>Two of the sons of Aaron "offered strange fire before the Lord" and "there went out fire
from the Lord, and devoured them, and they died before the Lord." <a href="10.html#1">10:1-3</a>
                
<p><li> If priests misbehave at the tabernacle by uncovering their heads, tearing their clothes, leaving 
with holy oil on them, or by drinking "wine or strong drink", then God will kill them and send his 
wrath on &quot;all the people.&quot;  <a href="10.html#6">10:6-9</a>

<p><li>God "put the plague of leprosy" into the houses of the Canaanites. <a href="14.html#34">14:34</a>

<p><li>"For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death." Couldn't
we try spanking first?  <a href="20.html#9">20:9</a>

<p><li>Both parties in adultery shall be executed.  <a href="20.html#10">20:10</a>

<p><li>If a man has sex with his father's wife, kill them both.  <a href="20.html#11">20:11</a>

<p><li>If a man "lies" with his daughter-in-law, then both must be killed. 
 <a href="20.html#12">20:12</a>
 
<p><li>If a man has sex with another man, kill them both. <a href="20.html#13">20:13</a>

<p><li>If you "lie" with your wife and your mother-in-law (now that sounds fun!), then all three
of you must be burned to death.  <a href="20.html#14">20:14</a>

<p><li>If a man or woman "lie with a beast" both the person and the poor animal are to be
killed.  <a href="20.html#15">20:15-16</a>

<p><li>People with &quot;familiar spirits&quot; (witches, fortune tellers, etc.) are to be 
stoned to death.&nbsp;  <a href="20.html#27">20:27</a>

 <p><li>A priest's daughter who "plays the whore" is to be burned to death. 
 <a href="21.html#9">21:9</a>
 
<p><li>Don't do any work on the day of atonement or God will destroy you.
 <a href="23.html#29">23:29-30</a>
 
 <p><li>A man curses and blasphemes while disputing with another man. Moses asks God what to 
do about it. God says that the whole community must stone him to death. "And the children of Israel did as the Lord 
and Moses commanded." <a href="24.html#10">24:10-23</a>

 <p><li>Anyone who blasphemes or curses shall be stoned to death by the entire community. 
 <a href="24.html#16">24:16</a>
 
 <p><li>God tells the Israelites to make slaves out of their neighbors and their families. The "heathens" and
"strangers" are to be their possessions forever.  <a href="25.html#44">25:44-46</a>
 
<p><li>God tells the Israelites to "chase" their enemies and make them "fall before you by the
sword." He figures five of the Israelites will be able to "chase" a hundred of their enemies, and a
hundred will be able to "put ten thousand to flight."  <a href="26.html#7">26:7-8</a>

<p><li>God describes the torments that he has planned for those who displease him. The usual
stuff: plagues, burning fevers that will consume the eyes, etc. but he reserves the worst for the
little children. He says "ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it," "I will send
wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children," and "ye shall eat the flesh of your
sons and daughters."  <a href="26.html#16">26:16-39</a>

<p><li>All "devoted" things (both man and beast) "shall surely be put to death." 
 <a href="27.html#28">27:28-29</a>
