<p><li>King Ahasuerus throws a party and encourages his guests to drink to excess. Then, when they are all drunk, he orders
Queen Vashti to show her stuff before him and his guests.  <a href="1.html#7">1:7-11</a>

<p><li>"All the fair young virgins" throughout the kingdom are brought before the king, and the one that "pleaseth" the
king the most will replace Vashti. <a href="2.html#2">2:2-4</a>

<p><li>When it was Esther turn to "go in unto the king," she pleases the king the most. So, having won the sex
contest, she is made queen in Vashti's place.  <a href="2.html#8">2:8-9, 12-17</a>

<p><li>Since women are inherently dirty, the woman that "pleased the king" the most must be "purified" for 
twelve months before she can be made queen. <a href="2.html#9">2:9-12</a>
