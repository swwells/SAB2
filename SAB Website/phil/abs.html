<p><li>"Beware of dogs ... beware of the concision." I'm not sure who Paul is calling 
"dogs" here, but it's probably the Jews -- those of "the 
circumcision," as opposed to Christians, who are of the "true circumcision." <a href="3.html#2">3:2</a>
 
<p><li>"Be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye
    have us for an ensample"<br>
    Forget Jesus. Paul says you should follow him, or follow the people that follow him. <a href="3.html#17">3:17</a> 

<p><li>Believe whatever Paul tells you to believe, think whatever he tells you to think, 
and do whatever he tells you to do.  <a href="4.html#9">4:9</a>

<p><li>"I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me."<br>
  Christians are superhuman and omnipotent. They can do whatever they want.

<p><li>"My God shall supply all your need." <a href="4.html#19">4:19</a>
