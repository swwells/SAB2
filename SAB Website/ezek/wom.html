<BODY>
<p><li> God sends a &quot;man clothed with linen&quot; to mark the foreheads of the men who will be 
saved. Apparently only men are considered good enough to keep, the others (unmarked 
men, &quot;maids&quot;, little children, and women) are to be slaughtered. God says 
he'll &quot;fill the courts with the slain&quot; and will have pity on no 
one. <a href="9.html#4">9:4-11</a>

<p><li>"Woe to the woman that sew pillows ... Behold, I am against your 
pillows." (God likes neither woman nor pillows.) <a href="13.html#18">13:18-21</a>

<p><li>God dresses up Jerusalem, 
cleans off the blood that  she was wallowing in, and compliments her on her nice hair 
and breasts.  <a href="16.html#6">16:6-7, 22</a>

<p><li>Jerusalem was a harlot who had sex with everyone that passed by. If no one was available, she "committed whoredom" with "images of men."
 <a href="16.html#15">16:15-17</a>

<p><li>"Thou ... hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by." <a href="16.html#25">16:25</a>

<p><li>"Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, great of flesh." (Jerusalem 
had sex with Egyptians with big penises.) <a href="16.html#26">16:26</a>

<p><li>Jerusalem still wasn't satisfied after having sex with the the well-endowed Egyptians (v.26), so she had sex with Assyrians, Canaanites, Chaldeans, 
and complete strangers, but still was not satisfied. So she hired men to "come in unto [her] on every side." <a href="16.html#28">16:28-29</a>

<p><li>God calls Jerusalem "an imperious whorish woman." <a href="16.html#30">16:30</a>

<p><li>God says that Jerusalem has sex with strangers, hiring them to "come in unto thee on every side."
<a href="16.html#32">16:32-33</a>

<p><li>Because she is such a filthy harlot, God will expose her nakedness 
before all of her lovers. <a href="16.html#35">16:35-37</a>

<p><li>After exposing her nakedness, God will give her "blood in fury and jealousy" and strip her naked once more. 
Then he'll have her stoned "with stones and thrust through with swords." <a href="16.html#38">16:38-41</a>

<p><li> A good man never gets near a menstruating
woman.  <a href="18.html#5">18:5-6</a>

<p><li>"They humbled her that was set apart for pollution."</i> <br>
    (They had sex with a menstruating woman.) <a href="22.html#10">22:10</a>

<p><li> Two sisters were guilty of &quot;committing whoredoms&quot; by pressing their breasts and 
bruising &quot;the teats of their virginity.&quot; As a punishment, one sister's nakedness was 
discovered, her children were taken from her, and she was killed by the sword. And the fate of the 
surviving sister was even worse: Her nose and ears were cut off, she was made to &quot;pluck off&quot; 
her own breasts, and then after being raped and mutilated, she is stoned to death. 
<a href="23.html#1">23:1-49</a>

<p><li>"Their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity." <a href="23.html#3">23:3</a>

<p><li>"Thus she committed her whoredoms with them ... with all their idols she defiled herself." <a href="23.html#7">23:7</a>

<p><li>"They bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her." <a href="23.html#8">23:8</a>

<p><li>"These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword." <a href="23.html#10">23:10</a>

<p><li>"Her sister ... was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and
    in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms." <a href="23.html#11">23:11</a>
    
<p><li>"And the Babylonians came
    to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom,
    and she was polluted with them." <a href="23.html#17">23:17</a>  
    
<p><li>"So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness ... she multiplied her whoredoms." <a href="23.html#18">23:18-19</a>

<p><li>Really Big Penises. One of the sister (Aholibah) had lovers
&quot;whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.&quot;
<a href="23.html#20">23:20</a>
 
<p><li>"The lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth." <a href="23.html#21">23:21</a>

<p><li>"They shall also strip
    thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels." <a href="23.html#26">23:26</a>
    
<p><li>"I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen ... Thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in 
derision ... thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow." <a href="23.html#30">23:30-33</a>  

<p><li>"Thou shalt ... pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD." <a href="23.html#34">23:34</a>  

<p><li>"They came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and
    deckedst thyself with ornaments, And satest upon a stately bed." <a href="23.html#40">23:40-41</a>
    
        <p><li>"They went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot." <a href="23.html#44">23:44</a>
        
     <p><LI>"And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; 
    because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands." <a href="23.html#45">23:45</a>       

<p><li>"Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught." <a href="23.html#48">23:48</a>

<p><li>God gets all excited about cooking with "scum" and human flesh, saying "kindle the fire, consume the
flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned. Her scum shall be in the fire." <a href="24.html#3">24:3-14</a>

<p><li> God kills Ezekiel's wife and then tells him not to mourn her.  <a href="24.html#15">24:16-18</a>

<p><li> God says he will destroy Tyrus. He plans to kill everyone, but he is especially looking 
 forward to killing all of the women. "And her daughters  which are in the field shall be slain by the sword; and 
they shall know that I am the LORD." <a href="26.html#1">26:1-21</a>

<p><li>The Israelites were like a menstruating women, so God poured his fury on them.  <a href="36.html#17">36:17-18</a>
