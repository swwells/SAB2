Sarah, who is about 90 years old and has gone through menopause, laughs at God when he tells her that she will have a
son. She asks God if she will "have pleasure" with her "lord" [Abraham], when both are so very old. God assures her that 
he will return and impregnate her at the appointed time.<br>

<p>(18:10) <i>"Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him."</i>

<a href="../contra/cando.html">Can God do anything?</a>

<p>(18:15) <i>"Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh."</i>

<img src="../images/contra1.gif" > (18:16-17)<br>
God, who is planning another mass murder, is
worried that Abraham might try to stop him. so he asks himself if he should hide
his intentions from Abraham.<br>
<a href="../contra/knows.html">Does God know everything?</a>

<p>(18:16) <i>"The men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way."</i>

<p>(18:17) <i>"Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?"</i>

<a href="../contra/knows.html">Does God know everything?</a>

<p><img src="../images/inj1.gif" > (18:22-25) Abraham begs God not to kill everyone in
Sodom and Gomorrah. [Which is odd, since later (<a href="../gen/22.html#2">Gen.22:2-10</a>) 
Abraham doesn't even question God's request that he kill his own son.] He asks God two good questions: "Wilt thou destroy the
righteous with the wicked?" and "Shall not the Judge of all the earth
do right?" (The answers are "yes" and "no", respectively.)

<p>(18:22) <i>"Abraham stood yet before the LORD."</i>

<p>(18:23) <i>"And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?"</i>

<p>(18:25) <i>"Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"</i>

    <img src="../images/fv.gif"> (18:32)<br>  <i>"I will not destroy it for ten's sake."</i><br>
    I guess God couldn't find even ten good Sodomites because he decides to kill them all in <a href="19.html">Genesis 19</a>. 
    Too bad Abraham didn't ask God about the children. Why not save them? If Abraham could find 10 good children, toddlers, infants, or babies, would 
    God spare the city? Apparently not. God doesn't give a damn about children.
