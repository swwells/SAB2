themselves together, and did place at their head a man whom they did call Jacob;

one of the chiefest who had given his voice against the prophets who testified of Jesus. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

the land, and there build up unto themselves a kingdom, until they were joined by dissenters, (for he flattered 
them that there would be many dissenters) and they become sufficiently strong to contend with the tribes of the 
people; and they did so. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

tribes, every man according to his family, kindred and friends; nevertheless they had come to an agreement that 
they would not go to war one with another; but they were not united as to their laws, and their manner of 
government, for they were established according to the minds of those who were their chiefs and their leaders.  
But they did establish very strict laws that one tribe should not trespass against another, insomuch that in some 
degree they had peace in the land; nevertheless, their hearts were turned from the Lord their God, and they did 
stone the prophets and did cast them out from among them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

from righteousness unto their wickedness and abominations; <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>7:16</b>   Therefore, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts and the blindness of their minds -- 
went forth among them in that same year, and began to testify, boldly, repentance and remission of sins through

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>7:17</b>   And he did minister many things unto them; and all of them cannot be written, and a part of

with great authority. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>7:18</b>   <span class="a">It came to pass</span> that they were angry with him, even because he had 
greater power than they, for it were not possible that they could disbelieve his words, for so great was his 
faith on the Lord Jesus Christ that angels did minister unto him daily. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

 who were not baptized with water. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>7:25</b>   Therefore, there were ordained of Nephi, men unto this ministry, that all such as should come 
 unto them should be baptized with water, and this as a witness and a testimony before God, and unto the people, 
 that they had repented and received a remission of their sins. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>7:26</b>   And there were many in the commencement of this year that were baptized unto repentance; and 
 thus the more part of the year did pass away. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>
