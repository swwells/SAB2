<p><li>Polygamy is condemned as "wicked" and "abominable." (Was it wicked for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith#Polygamy">Joseph Smith</a>, 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Brigham_Young's_wives">Brigham Young</a>, and 
<a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/americas/united-states/120131/mitt-romneys-great-grandfather-fled-mexico-pract">Mitt Romney's great grandfather</a>?)

<p><li>Those who hope in Christ will obtain riches. <a href="2.html#19">2:19</a>

<p><li>"I, the Lord God, delight in the chastity of women. And whoredoms are an abomination before me." <a href="2.html#28">2:28</a>

<p><li>"Unless ye shall repent of your sins that their skins will be whiter than yours." <a href="3.html#8">3:8</a>

<p><li>God made the Lamanites (Native Americans) filthy and dark skinned "because of their fathers."
 <a href="3.html#9">3:9</a>
 
 <p><li>Jacob continued his sermon to the Nephites, but he only has space for less than 1% of it (which began to be numerous) in the small plates. 
See the large plates for the details. <a href="3.html#12">3:12-13</a>

<p><li>Jacob's small plates are called the plates of Jacob, and they were made by the (dead?) hand of Nephi. 
And that's all Jacob has to say about that. <a href="3.html#14">3:14</a>
 
<p><li>If writing on metal plates was so tough, then why did Nephi bother copying 22 chapters from Isaiah?
 <a href="4.html#1">4:1</a>
 
 <p><li>"We ... engraven these words upon plates ... that they may know that we knew of Christ ... many hundred years before his coming." 
  <a href="4.html#3">4:3-4</a>
  
<p><li>All the prophets in the Hebrew scriptures (Moses, Isaiah, Jeremiah, etc.) believed in Jesus and worshipped God in his name -- 
hundreds of years before Jesus was born. <a href="4.html#4">4:4-5</a>
  
  <p><li>The Nephites could tell trees, mountains, and waves what to do "in the name of Jesus." <a href="4.html#6">4:6</a>
  
  <p><li>Jacob continues to tell us about Jesus, who will be born 500 or so years in the future. You must believe in him 
  (even centuries before he was born) or you'll burn in hell. This is the umpteenth time Book of Mormon has 
  told us about this. <a href="6.html#1">6:1-13</a>
  
<p><li>"O be wise; what can I say more?"  <a href="6.html#12">6:12</a>

<p><li>Jacob says goodbye, saying he won't see us again until we are beaten with "the pleasing rod of God." But then 
he shows back up again in the next chapter. You just can't get rid of that guy. <a href="6.html#12">6:12</a>

<p><li>After God killed Sherem, things got back to normal. The Nephites were righteous and the Lamanites were wicked. So the Nephites built up their military to fight the Lamanites. <a href="7.html#23">7:23-24</a>
 
<p><li>"Adieu" is a French word which did not exist at the time the book of Jacob was supposedly written (ca. 500 BCE).
