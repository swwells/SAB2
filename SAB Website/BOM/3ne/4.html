<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>4:5</b>   <span class="a">It came to pass</span> that in the nineteenth year Giddianhi found that it 
was expedient that he should go up to battle against the Nephites, for there was no way that they could subsist 
save it were to plunder and rob and murder. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>4:6</b>   And they durst not spread themselves upon the face of the land insomuch that they could raise 
grain, lest the Nephites should come upon them and slay them; therefore Giddianhi gave commandment unto his 
armies that in this year they should go up to battle against the Nephites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>4:7</b>   <span class="a">It came to pass</span> that they did come up to battle; and it was in the sixth 
month; and behold, great and terrible was the day that they did come up to battle; and they were girded about 
after the manner of robbers; and they had a lamb-skin about their loins, and they were dyed in blood, and their 
heads were shorn, and they had head-plates upon them; and great and terrible was the appearance of the armies of 
Giddianhi, because of their armor, and because of their being dyed in blood. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>4:8</b>   <span class="a">It came to pass</span> that the armies of the Nephites, when they saw the 
appearance of the army of Giddianhi, had all fallen to the earth, and did lift their cries to the Lord their 
God, that he would spare them and deliver them out of the hands of their enemies. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>4:9</b>   <span class="a">It came to pass</span> that when the armies of Giddianhi saw this they began to 
shout with a loud voice, because of their joy, for they had supposed that the Nephites had fallen with fear 
because of the terror of their armies. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>4:10</b>   But in this thing they were disappointed, for the Nephites did not fear them; but they did 
fear their God and did supplicate him for protection; therefore, when the armies of Giddianhi did rush upon them 
they were prepared to meet them; yea, in the strength of the Lord they did receive them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>4:11</b>   And the battle commenced in this the sixth month; and great and terrible was the battle thereof, 
yea, great and terrible was the slaughter thereof, insomuch that there never was known so great a slaughter among 
all the people of Lehi since he left Jerusalem. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>4:12</b>   And notwithstanding the threatenings and the oaths which Giddianhi had made, behold, the 
Nephites did beat them, insomuch that they did fall back from before them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>4:13</b>   <span class="a">It came to pass</span> that Gidgiddoni commanded that his armies should pursue 
them as far as the borders of the wilderness, and that they should not spare any that should fall into their hands 
by the way; and thus they did pursue them and did slay them, to the borders of the wilderness, even until they 
had fulfilled the commandment of Gidgiddoni. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>4:14</b>   <span class="a">It came to pass</span> that Giddianhi, who had stood and fought with boldness, 
was pursued as he fled; and being weary because of his much fighting he was overtaken and slain.  And thus was 
the end of Giddianhi the robber. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>4:15</b>   <span class="a">It came to pass</span> that the armies of the Nephites did return again to 
their place of security.  <span class="a">It came to pass</span> that this nineteenth year did pass away, and 
the robbers did not come again to battle; neither did they come again in the twentieth year. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>4:16</b>   And in the twenty and first year they did not come up to battle, but they came up on all sides 
to lay siege round about the people of Nephi; for they did suppose that if they should cut off the people of 
Nephi from their lands, and should hem them in on every side, and if they should cut them off from all their 
outward privileges, that they could cause them to yield themselves up according to their wishes. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>4:17</b>   Now they had appointed unto themselves another leader, whose name was 
Zemnarihah; therefore it 
was Zemnarihah that did cause that this siege should take place. 
<td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>4:18</b>   But behold, this was an advantage to the Nephites; for it was impossible for the robbers to 
lay siege sufficiently long to have any effect upon the Nephites, because of their much provision which they 
had laid up in store, <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>4:19</b>   And because of the scantiness of provisions among the robbers -- for behold, they had 
nothing save it were meat for their subsistence, which meat they did obtain in the wilderness; <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>4:20</b>   <span class="a">It came to pass</span> that the wild game became scarce in the wilderness -- 
insomuch that the robbers were about to perish with hunger. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>4:21</b>   And the Nephites were continually marching out by day and by night, and falling upon their 
armies, and cutting them off by thousands and by tens of thousands. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>4:22</b>   And thus it became the desire of the people of Zemnarihah to withdraw from their design, 
because of the great destruction which came upon them by night and by day. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>4:23</b>   <span class="a">It came to pass</span> that Zemnarihah did give command unto his people that 
they should withdraw themselves from the siege, and march into the furthermost parts of the land northward. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>4:24</b>   And now, Gidgiddoni being aware of their design, and knowing of their weakness because of the 
want of food, and the great slaughter which had been made among them, therefore he did send out his armies in 
the night-time, and did cut off the way of their retreat, and did place his armies in the way of their retreat. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>4:25</b>   And this did they do in the night-time, and got on their march beyond the robbers, so that on 
the morrow, when the robbers began their march, they were met by the armies of the Nephites both in their front 
and in their rear. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>4:26</b>   And the robbers who were on the south were also cut off in their places of retreat.  And all 
these things were done by command of Gidgiddoni. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>4:27</b>   And there were many thousands who did yield themselves up prisoners unto the Nephites, and the 
remainder of them were slain. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>4:28</b>   And their leader, Zemnarihah, was taken and hanged upon a tree, yea, even upon the top 
thereof until he was dead.  And when they had hanged him until he was dead they did fell the tree to the 
earth, and did cry with a loud voice, saying: <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>4:29</b>   May the Lord preserve his people in righteousness and in holiness of heart, that they may 
cause to be felled to the earth all who shall seek to slay them because of power and secret combinations, even 
as this man hath been felled to the earth. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>4:30</b>   And they did rejoice and cry again with one voice, saying: May the God of Abraham, and the 
God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, protect this people in righteousness, so long as they shall call on the 
name of their God for protection. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>4:31</b>   <span class="a">It came to pass</span> that they did break forth, all as one, in singing, 
and praising their God for the great thing which he had done for them, in preserving them from falling into 
the hands of their enemies. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="32"></a>4:32</b>   Yea, they did cry: Hosanna to the Most High God.  And they did cry: Blessed be the name 
of the Lord God Almighty, the Most High God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="33"></a>4:33</b>   And their hearts were swollen with joy, unto the gushing out of many tears, because of 
the great goodness of God in delivering them out of the hands of their enemies; and they knew it was because 
of their repentance and their humility that they had been delivered from an everlasting destruction. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>
