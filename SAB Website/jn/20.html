ascending into heaven. One wonders why he insisted that Thomas touch him (<A href="20.html#27">Jn.20:27</A>), and why he permitted his

  The first day of the week cometh <span class="c">Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark</span>, unto the
    sepulchre, and <span class="c">seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.</span>
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="2">20:2</A></B>
  Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple,
    whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the LORD out of
    the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="3">20:3</A></B>
  Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the
    sepulchre.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="4">20:4</A></B>
  So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and
    came first to the sepulchre.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="5">20:5</A></B>
  And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet
    went he not in.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="6">20:6</A></B>
  Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and
    seeth the linen clothes lie,
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="7">20:7</A></B>
  And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes,
    but wrapped together in a place by itself.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="8">20:8</A></B>
  Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre,
    and he saw, and believed.

  <span class="c">For as yet they knew

  Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.

  <tr><td><B><A name="11">20:11</A></B>
  But <span class="c">Mary</span> stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she
    stooped down, and <span class="c">looked
    into the sepulchre</span>,
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="12">20:12</A></B>
  And seeth <span class="c">two angels</span> in white <span class="c">sitting</span>, the one at the head, and the other at the

  <tr><td><B><A name="13">20:13</A></B>
  And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them,
    Because they have taken away my LORD, and I know not where they have laid
    him.

  <tr><td><B><A name="14">20:14</A></B>
  And when she had thus
    said, <span class="c">she</span> turned herself back, and <span class="c">saw Jesus standing, and knew not that
    it was Jesus.</span>
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="15">20:15</A></B>
  Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She,
    supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne
    him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="16">20:16</A></B>
  Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him,
    Rabboni; which is to say, Master

  <tr><td><B><A name="17">20:17</A></B>
  Jesus saith unto her,
    <span class="c">Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father</span>: but go to my
    brethren, and say unto them, <span class="c">I ascend unto my Father, and your Father</span>; and

  <tr><td><B><A name="18">20:18</A></B>
  Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the LORD, and
    that he had spoken these things unto her.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="19">20:19</A></B>
  <span class="c">Then the same day at

     where the disciples  were assembled <span class="i">for fear of the Jews</span>, 
     <span class="c">came Jesus and stood in the midst</span>, and saith

  <tr><td><B><A name="20">20:20</A></B>
  And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. <span class="c">Then were the

  <tr><td><B><A name="21">20:21</A></B>
  Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent
    me, even so send I you.

  <tr><td><B><A name="22">20:22</A></B>
  And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them,

  <tr><td><B><A name="23">20:23</A></B>
  Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever

  But <span class="c">Thomas</span>, one of the twelve, called Didymus, <span class="c">was not with them when

  <tr><td><B><A name="25">20:25</A></B>
  The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the LORD. But he
    said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands <span class="interp">the print of the nails</span>, and
    put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side,
    I will not believe.

  <tr><td><B><A name="26">20:26</A></B>
  And <span class="c">after eight days</span> again his disciples were within, and Thomas with
