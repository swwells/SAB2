Surely pure religion is for Allah only. And those who choose protecting  friends beside Him (say): We worship them only that they may bring us near unto  Allah. Lo!

He created you from one being, then from that (being) He made its mate; and  He hath provided for you of cattle eight kinds.

If ye are thankless, yet Allah is Independent of you, though He is not pleased  with thanklessness for His bondmen; and if ye are thankful He is pleased therewith  for you.

Him before, and setteth up rivals to Allah that he may beguile  (men) from his way.

Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Are those who  know equal with those who know not ? But only men of understanding will pay heed. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
