<p><li>When Antiochus attacked Jerusalem and desecrated the temple, "the beauty of the women was changed." <a href="1.html#27">1:27</a>

<p><li>"Mathathias and his sons rent their garments, and they covered themselves with haircloth." <a href="2.html#14">2:14</a>

<p><li>Matthathias and his friends gathered an army, slew the sinners, threw down altars, and valiantly circumcised all the uncircumcised 
children they could find. "And they yielded not the horn to the sinner." <a href="2.html#39">2:39-48</a>

<p><li>Before he dies, Mathathias praises some of the nastiest characters in the Bible: <a href="../../gen/22.html#1">Abraham</a>,

 <p><li>"He was renowned even to the utmost part of the earth."<br>
OK. That's a bit of an exaggeration. <a href="3.html#9">3:9</a>

<p><li>Seron, the captain of the Syrian army, heard about Judas (as had everyone on earth). He collected a large army of wicked 
men to fight Judas. When Judas' smaller army saw the Syrians, they were frightened. But Judas told them not to worry. Because 
success in war depends not on numbers, but on God. "The Lord himself will overthrow them." <a href="3.html#13">3:13</a>

 <p><li>"As soon as he had made an end of speaking, he rushed suddenly upon them: and Seron and his host were overthrown before him ... 
 and there fell of them eight hundred men." <a href="3.html#23">3:23-24</a>
 
 <p><li>The entire world was afraid of Judas! <a href="3.html#25">3:25-26</a>
 
 <p><li>Judas and the Israelites prepare for war by putting on haircloth, putting ashes on their 
heads, rending their garments, blowing a trumpet, and crying together with a loud, long, boring prayer to heaven. <a href="3.html#47">3:47-54</a>
 
 <p><li>Judas and his completely unarmed valiant men defeat 5000 well-armed soldiers. Judas told his men not to do anything; God would do 
 the killing for them. And he did. God killed 3000 Gentile soldiers, and Judas and his men enriched themselves with the booty. 
 <a href="4.html#1">4:1-24</a>
 
 <p><li> After God "discomfited" the Gentiles, Judas and his brethren went to clean up the Temple in Jerusalem. They found it 
 a bit of a mess. So they did the usual things that Jews do when they get upset: they rent their garments, put ashes 
 on their heads, and fell on their faces. <a href="4.html#36">4:36-40</a>
 
 <p><li>"And all the people fell upon their faces." <a href="4.html#55">4:55</a>
