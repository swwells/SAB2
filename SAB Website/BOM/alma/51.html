"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",
"<span class='i'>Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever.</span>--<a href='3.html#14'>Alma 3:14</a>",
"<span class='i'>I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</span>--<a href='3.html#15'>Alma 3:15</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",
"<span class='a'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges ... even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year....</span>--<a href='16.html#1'>Alma 16:1</a>",
"<span class='a'>Their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.</span>--<a href='16.html#11'>Alma 16:11</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.   Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</span>--<a href='30.html#22'>Alma 30:22</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",
"<span class='i'>God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.</span>--<a href='30.html#47'>Alma 30:47</a>",
"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",

"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",
"<span class='i'>These dissenters ... became ... more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='47.html#36'>Alma 47:36</a>",
"<span class='a'>God would prosper them in the land, or in other words ... God ... would prosper them in the land.</span>--<a href='48.html#15'>Alma 48:15</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='50.html#22'>Alma 50:22</a>",
"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",
"<span class='i'>The remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty.</span>--<a href='51.html#20'>Alma 51:20</a>",
"<span class='g'>And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye.</span>--<a href='54.html#21'>Alma 54:21</a>",

<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>51:1</b>   <span class="a">And now it came to pass</span> in the commencement of the twenty and fifth year of 
the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, they having established peace between the people of 
Lehi and the people of Morianton concerning their lands, and having commenced the 
twenty and fifth year in peace; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1"><a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a><br>
[51:1, 5, 7(2), 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 23(2), 25, 28, 29, 30, 32(2), 33, 34]
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>51:2</b>   Nevertheless, they did not long maintain an entire peace in the land, for there began to be a 
contention among the people concerning the chief judge Pahoran; for behold, there were a part of the people who 
desired that a few particular points of the law should be altered. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>51:3</b>   But behold, Pahoran would not alter nor suffer the law to be altered; therefore, he did not hearken 
to those who had sent in their voices with their petitions concerning the altering of the law. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>51:4</b>   Therefore, those who were desirous that the law should be altered were angry with him, and desired 
that he should no longer be chief judge over the land; therefore there arose a warm dispute concerning the matter, 
but not unto bloodshed. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>51:5</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that those who were desirous that Pahoran should be 
dethroned from the judgment-seat were called king-men, for they were desirous that the law should be altered in 
a manner to overthrow the free government and to establish a king over the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>51:6</b>   And those who were desirous that Pahoran should remain chief judge over the land took upon them the 
name of freemen; and thus was the division among them, for the freemen had sworn or covenanted to maintain their 
rights and the privileges of their religion by a free government. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>51:7</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that this matter of their contention was settled by the 
voice of the people.  <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the voice of the people came in favor of the 
freemen, and Pahoran retained the judgment-seat, which caused much rejoicing among the brethren of Pahoran and 
also many of the people of liberty, who also put the king-men to silence, that they durst not oppose but were 
obliged to maintain the cause of freedom. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>51:8</b>   Now those who were in favor of kings were those of high birth, and they sought to be kings; and 
they were supported by those who sought power and authority over the people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>51:9</b>   But behold, this was a critical time for such contentions to be among the people of Nephi; 
for behold, Amalickiah had again stirred up the hearts of the people of the Lamanites against the people of the 
Nephites, and he was gathering together soldiers from all parts of his land, and arming them, and preparing for 
war with all diligence; for he had sworn to drink the blood of Moroni. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>51:10</b>   But behold, we shall see that his promise which he made was rash; nevertheless, he did prepare 
himself and his armies to come to battle against the Nephites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>51:11</b>   Now his armies were not so great as they had hitherto been, because of the many thousands who 
had been slain by the hand of the Nephites; but notwithstanding their great loss, Amalickiah had gathered 
together a wonderfully great army, insomuch that he feared not to come down to the land of Zarahemla. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>51:12</b>   Yea, even Amalickiah did himself come down, at the head of the Lamanites.  And it was in the 
twenty and fifth year of the reign of the judges; and it was at the same time that they had begun to settle 
the affairs of their contentions concerning the chief judge, Pahoran. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>51:13</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when the men who were called king-men had 
heard that the Lamanites were coming down to battle against them, they were glad in their hearts; and they 
refused to take up arms, for they were so wroth with the chief judge, and also with the people of liberty, 
that they would not take up arms to defend their country. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>51:14</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when Moroni saw this, and also saw that the 
Lamanites were coming into the borders of the land, he was <span class="a">exceedingly</span> wroth because 
of the stubbornness of those people whom he had labored with so much diligence to preserve; yea, he 
was <span class="a">exceedingly</span> wroth; his soul was filled with anger against them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1"><a href="exceed_list.html">Exceedingly</a> 
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>51:15</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that 
	<span class="v">he sent a petition</span>, with the voice of the 
people, <span class="v">unto the governor of the land, desiring that he should read it, and give him (Moroni) power to compel 
those dissenters to defend their country or to put them to death. </span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Moroni writes a petition empowering him "to compel those dissenters to defend their country or 
to put them to death." 
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>51:16</b>   For it was his first care to put an end to such contentions and dissensions among the people; 
for behold, this had been hitherto a cause of all their destruction.  <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> 
that it was granted according to the voice of the people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>51:17</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Moroni commanded that his army should go 
against those king-men, to pull down their pride and their nobility and level them with the earth, or they 
should take up arms and support the cause of liberty. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>51:18</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the armies did march forth against them; and 
they did pull down their pride and their nobility, <span class="v">insomuch that as they did lift their weapons of war to 
fight against the men of Moroni they were hewn down </span>and leveled to the earth. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>51:19</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that <span class="v">there were four thousand of those dissenters 
who were hewn down by the sword;</span> and those of their leaders who were not slain in battle were taken and cast 
into prison, for there was no time for their trials at this period. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/inj1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<img src="../../images/cr1.gif" width="32" height="32"><br>
<font size="-1">Four thousand dissenters were "hewn down by the sword." 
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>51:20</b>   And <span class="i">the remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, 
yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty</span> upon their towers, and in 
their cities, and to take up arms in defence of their country. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/int.gif" width="32" height="32">
<img src="../../images/inj1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1"> The rest of the dissenters were forced to live in freedom (just like the Iraqis!).
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>51:21</b>   And thus Moroni put an end to those king-men, that there were not any known by the appellation 
of king-men; and thus he put an end to the stubbornness and the pride of those people who professed the blood 
of nobility; but they were brought down to humble themselves like unto their brethren, and to fight valiantly 
for their freedom from bondage. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>51:22</b>   <span class="a">Behold, it came to pass</span> that while Moroni was thus breaking down the wars and contentions 
among his own people, and subjecting them to peace and civilization, and making regulations to prepare for 
war against the Lamanites, behold, the Lamanites had come into the land of Moroni, which was in the borders 
by the seashore. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>51:23</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Nephites were not sufficiently strong in 
the city of Moroni; therefore Amalickiah did drive them, slaying many.  <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> 
that Amalickiah took possession of the city, yea, possession of all their fortifications. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>51:24</b>   And those who fled out of the city of Moroni came to the city of Nephihah; and also the people 
of the city of Lehi gathered themselves together, and made preparations and 
were ready to receive the Lamanites to battle. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>51:25</b>   <span class="a">But it came to pass</span> that Amalickiah would not suffer the Lamanites to go against the city of 
Nephihah to battle, but kept them down by the seashore, leaving men in every city to maintain and defend it. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>51:26</b>   And thus he went on, taking possession of many cities, the city of Nephihah, and the city 
of Lehi, and the city of Morianton, and the city of Omner, and the city of Gid, 
and the city of Mulek, all of which were on the east borders by the seashore. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>51:27</b>   And thus had the Lamanites obtained, by the cunning of Amalickiah, so many cities, by their 
numberless hosts, all of which were strongly fortified after the manner of the fortifications of Moroni; all 
of which afforded strongholds for the Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>51:28</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they marched to the borders of the land 
Bountiful, driving the Nephites before them and slaying many. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>51:29</b>   <span class="a">But it came to pass</span> that they were met by Teancum, who had slain Morianton and had headed 
his people in his flight. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>51:30</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that he headed Amalickiah also, as he was marching 
forth with his numerous army that he might take possession of the land Bountiful, and also the land northward. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>51:31</b>   But behold he met with a disappointment by being repulsed by Teancum and his men, for they were 
great warriors; for every man of Teancum did exceed the Lamanites in their strength and in their skill of war, 
insomuch that they did gain advantage over the Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="32"></a>51:32</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they did harass them, insomuch that they did 
slay them even until it was dark.  <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Teancum and his men did pitch 
their tents in the borders of the land Bountiful; and Amalickiah did pitch his tents in the borders on the beach 
by the seashore, and after this manner were they driven. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="33"></a>51:33</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when the night had come, Teancum and his 
servant stole forth and went out by night, and went into the camp of Amalickiah; and behold, sleep had 
overpowered them because of their much fatigue, which was caused by the labors and heat of the day. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="34"></a>51:34</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that <span class="v">Teancum stole privily into the tent of the 
king, and put a javelin to his heart</span>; and he did cause the death of the king immediately that he did not awake
 his servants. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/cr1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1"> Teancum snuck into the king's tent and stuck a javelin into his heart.
</font>
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="35"></a>51:35</b>   And he returned again privily to his own camp, and behold, his men were asleep, and he awoke 
 them and told them all the things that he had done. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="36"></a>51:36</b>   And he caused that his armies should stand in readiness, lest the Lamanites had awakened and 
 should come upon them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="37"></a>51:37</b>   And thus endeth the twenty and fifth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi; 
 and thus endeth the days of Amalickiah. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
