<p><li>Paul returns the runaway slave, Onesimus, to his "rightful owner", Philemon. This was, of course, a great opportunity for Paul 
(and God) to condemn slavery -- if he (and God) had anything against it, that is. But he doesn't. Instead he returns the slave to his 
owner without a word against the institution of slavery. <a href="1.html#12">1:12</a>
