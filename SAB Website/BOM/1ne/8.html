 (8:2-38) Lehii's Dream<br>
Nephi dreams about a tree with white, sweet-tasting fruit. He wants his family to eat the fruit. Nephi, Sam, and Sariah do; Laman and 
Lemuel don't. An iron rod leads people to the tree, but some are ashamed to eat its fruit after being taunted by well-dressed people 
in a building that floats in the sky. Those who don't eat the fruit or who leave after eating it are lost, drowned, or destroyed.<br>
(Lehi's dream was nearly identical to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life_vision">Joseph Smith, Sr.'s dream</a> 2400 years later, before Joseph Smith, Jr. "translated" the Book of 
Mormon.) 

<p>(8:2) <i>"Behold, I have dreamed a dream; or, in 
other words, I have seen a vision."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif">
<img src="../../images/inj1.gif"> (8:3-4) Lehi thinks his dream assures the salvation of Nephi, 
Sam, and "their seed" and the damnation of Laman and Lemuel. (Because the former ate the magic fruit and the latter didn't.)

<p><i>"I have reason to rejoice ... because of Nephi and ... Sam; for ... they, and also many 
of their seed, will be saved. But behold, Laman and Lemuel, I fear exceedingly."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> 
<a href="exceed_list.html">Exceedingly</a><br>
 (8:4, 12, 23, 27, 36)
 
<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (8:10-33) 

<p>(8:10) Lehi dreamed about tree with fruit that could make you 
happy if you ate it (or smoked it?).

<p><i>"I beheld a tree, whose fruit was desirable to make one happy."</i> 

<p>(8:11) Lehi partook of the fruit thereof, and it was 
the sweetest thing he'd ever tasted, and was whiter than anything he'd ever seen before. (Being white is the best thing a 
thing can be in the Book of Mormon.)

<p><i>"I did go forth and partake of the fruit thereof; and I beheld that it was most sweet, above all 
that I ever before tasted ... and ... white, to exceed all the whiteness that I had ever seen."</i>

<p>(8:12) And it made him exceedingly happy, happier than he'd 
ever been before. He was so darned happy he could hardly stand it. So he wanted his family to eat from the happy tree, too.

<p><i>"And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy; wherefore, I began to be desirous 
that my family should partake of it also."</i>

<p>(8:13) So Lehi cast his eyes round about until he discovered his family.

<p><i>"I cast my eyes round about, that perhaps I might discover my family."</i>

<p>(8:14-16) Lehi told his family to eat the happy fruit, 
and the good members of his family (Nephi, Sariah, and Sam) ate it.

<p><i>"I beheld ... Sariah, and Sam, and Nephi ... And it came to pass that I ... did say 
unto them with a loud voice that they should ... partake of the fruit ... And it came to pass that they did."</i>

<p>(8:17-18) After the good guys ate the good fruit, Lehi cast his 
eyes about again until he saw Laman and Lemuel. He told them to eat the fruit, but they wouldn't do it (because they were bad).

<p><i>"And it came to pass that I was desirous that Laman and Lemuel should come and partake of the fruit also; wherefore, 
I cast mine eyes ... that perhaps I might see them. And it came to pass that I saw them, but they would 
not come unto me and partake of the fruit."</i>

<p>(8:19) Lehi saw an iron rod along the side of the river that 
people clung to as they traveled towards the happy tree.

<p><i>"And I beheld a rod of iron, and it extended along the bank of the river, and led to the tree by which I stood."</i>

<p>(8:23) In the background there was a mist of darkness that lots of 
people got lost in.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that there arose a mist of darkness; yea, even an exceedingly great mist of darkness, insomuch that they 
who had commenced in the path did lose their way, that they wandered off and were lost."</i>

<p>(8:24) But some managed to find the happy-fruit tree by hanging 
on to the rod of iron.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that I beheld others ... clinging to the rod of iron, even until they did ... partake of the 
fruit of the tree."</i>

<p>(8:25) But after partaking of the happy fruit, the people cast 
their eyes about like they were ashamed or something.

<p><i>"And after they had partaken of the fruit of the tree they did cast their eyes about as if they were ashamed."</i>

<p>(8:26) Then Lehi cast his eyes about again and 
saw a big building floating in the air.

<p><i>"And I also cast my eyes round about, and beheld ... a great and spacious 
building ... in the air, high above the earth."</i>

<p>(8:27) The building was filled with people that 
were looking down and pointing and laughing at the people eating the happy fruit.

<p><i>"It was filled with people ... and their manner of dress was exceedingly fine; 
and they were ... mocking and pointing their fingers towards those who ... were partaking of the fruit."</i>

<p>(8:28) Then the people who were ashamed after eating the 
happy fruit crawled off into the darkness and got lost.

<p><i>"And after they had tasted of the fruit they were ashamed, because of those that were scoffing at them; and they fell away 
into forbidden paths and were lost."</i>

<p>(8:31-32) Some of the ashamed fruit-eaters made it to the 
big sky building, but others drowned.

<p><i>"He also saw other multitudes feeling their way towards that great and spacious building. And it came to pass that many were 
drowned in the depths of the fountain."</i>

<p>(8:33) Those that made it into the big building in the sky 
began pointing the finger of scorn at the happy fruit eaters below.

<p><i>"And great was the multitude that did enter into that strange building. And ... they 
did point the finger of scorn at me and those that were partaking of the fruit. "</i>

<tr><td><b><a name="7">8:7</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that as I followed 
him I beheld myself that I was in a dark and dreary waste. 

<tr><td><b><a name="8">8:8</b></a>   And after I had traveled for the space of many hours in 
darkness, I began to pray unto the Lord that he would have mercy on me, according to the 
multitude of his tender mercies. 

<tr><td><b><a name="9">8:9</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> after I had prayed 
unto the Lord I beheld a large and spacious field. 

<tr><td><b><a name="10">8:10</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that <span class="a">I beheld a 
tree, whose fruit was desirable to make one happy.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="11">8:11</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that <span class="a">I did go 
forth and partake of the fruit thereof; and I beheld that it was most sweet, above all 
that I ever before tasted.</span>  Yea, <span class="a">and</span> I beheld that the fruit thereof was <span class="a">white, to exceed 
all the whiteness that I had ever seen. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="12">8:12</b></a>   <span class="a">And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul 
with <span class="a">exceedingly</span> great joy; wherefore, I began to be desirous that 
my family should partake of it also;</span> for I knew that it was desirable above all other 
fruit. 

<tr><td><b><a name="13">8:13</b></a>   And <span class="a">as I cast my eyes round about, that perhaps I 
might discover my family</span> also, I beheld a river of water; and it ran along, and it was near 
the tree of which I was partaking the fruit. 

<tr><td><b><a name="14">8:14</b></a>   And I looked to behold from whence it came; and I saw the 
head thereof a little way off; and at the head thereof <span class="a">I beheld</span> your mother <span class="a">Sariah, and 
Sam, and Nephi</span>; and they stood as if they knew not whither they should go. 

<tr><td><b><a name="15">8:15</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that I beckoned 
unto them; <span class="a">and I also did say unto them with a loud voice that they should come unto me, 
and partake of the fruit</span>, which was desirable above all other fruit. 

<tr><td height="47"><b><a name="16">8:16</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that they did</span> come 
unto me and partake of the fruit also. 

<tr><td><b><a name="17">8:17</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that I was 
desirous that Laman and Lemuel should come and partake of the fruit also; wherefore, I cast 
mine eyes</span> towards the head of the river, </span>that perhaps I might see them.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="18">8:18</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that I saw them, 
but they would not come unto me and partake of the fruit. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="19">8:19</b></a>   <span class="a">And I beheld a rod of iron, and it extended along the bank of 
the river, and led to the tree by which I stood.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="20">8:20</b></a>   And I also beheld a strait and narrow path, which came along 
by the rod of iron, even to the tree by which I stood; and it also led by the head of the f
ountain, unto a large and spacious field, as if it had been a world. 

<tr><td><b><a name="21">8:21</b></a>   And I saw numberless concourses of people, many of whom were 
pressing forward, that they might obtain the path which led unto the tree by which I 
stood. 

<tr><td><b><a name="22">8:22</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they did 
come forth, and commence in the path which led to the tree. 

<tr><td><b><a name="23">8:23</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that there arose a 
mist of darkness; yea, even an <span class="a">exceedingly</span> great mist of darkness, 
insomuch that they who had commenced in the path did lose their way, that they wandered off 
and were lost.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="24">8:24</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that I beheld others </span>
pressing forward, and they came forth and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron; and 
they did press forward through the mist of darkness, <span class="a">clinging to the rod of iron, even 
until they did</span> come forth and <span class="a">partake of the fruit of the tree. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="25">8:25</b></a>   And <span class="a">after they had partaken of the fruit of the tree they did 
cast their eyes about as if they were ashamed.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="26">8:26</b></a>   <span class="a">And I also cast my eyes round about, and beheld</span>, on the other 
side of the river of water, <span class="a">a great and spacious building</span>; and it stood as it were <span class="a">in the 
air, high above the earth. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="27">8:27</b></a>   And <span class="a">it was filled with people</span>, both old and young, both male 
and female; <span class="a">and their manner of dress was exceedingly fine; and they 
were</span> in the attitude of <span class="a">mocking and pointing their fingers towards those who had come at 
and were partaking of the fruit.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="28">8:28</b></a>   And <span class="a">after they had tasted of the fruit they were ashamed, 
because of those that were scoffing at them; and they fell away into forbidden paths and 
were lost.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="29">8:29</b></a>   And now I, Nephi, do not speak all the words of my 
father. 

<tr><td><b><a name="30">8:30</b></a>   But, to be short in writing, behold, he saw other multitudes 
pressing forward; and they came and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron; and they did 
press their way forward, continually holding fast to the rod of iron, until they came forth 
and fell down and partook of the fruit of the tree. 

<tr><td><b><a name="31">8:31</b></a>   And <span class="a">he also saw other multitudes feeling their way towards 
that great and spacious building.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="32">8:32</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that many were 
drowned in the depths of the fountain;</span> and many were lost from his view, wandering in 
strange roads. 

<tr><td><b><a name="33">8:33</b></a>   <span class="a">And great was the multitude that did enter into that strange 
building.  And </span>after they did enter into that building <span class="a">they did point the finger of scorn 
at me and those that were partaking of the fruit</span> also; but we heeded them not. 


<tr><td><b><a name="34">8:34</b></a>   These are the words of my father: For as many as heeded them, 
had fallen away. 

<tr><td><b><a name="35">8:35</b></a>   And Laman and Lemuel partook not of the fruit, said my 
father. 

<tr><td><b><a name="36">8:36</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> after my father 
had spoken all the words of his dream or vision, which were many, he said unto us, because 
of these things which he saw in a vision, he <span class="a">exceedingly</span> feared for 
Laman and Lemuel; yea, he feared lest they should be cast off from the presence of the 
Lord. 

<tr><td><b><a name="37">8:37</b></a>   And he did exhort them then with all the feeling of a tender 
parent, that they would hearken to his words, that perhaps the Lord would be merciful to 
them, and not cast them off; yea, my father did preach unto them. 

<tr><td><b><a name="38">8:38</b></a>   And after he had preached unto them, and also prophesied unto 
them of many things, he bade them to keep the commandments of the Lord; and he did cease 
speaking unto them.
