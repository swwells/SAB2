(14:1, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18)

<p><img src="../../images/inj1.gif" >
<img src="../../images/int.gif" >
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (14:1-3)

<p>(14:1-2) Good news for "gentiles" in "the promised land." ("Gentiles" are 
non-Mormons and "the promised land" is the United States in Mormon-speak). All you have to do is become a Mormon and then you will be 
blessed by God (otherwise you're going to hell). 

<p><i>"If the Gentiles shall hearken unto the Lamb of God ... 
they shall be numbered among the seed of thy father; yea, ... and they shall be a blessed people upon the promised land forever."</i>

<p>(14:3) The Catholic church was founded by the devil to lead souls to hell.

<p><i>"That great and abominable church, which was founded 
by the devil and his children, that he might lead away the souls of men down to hell"</i> 

<p><img src="../../images/inj1.gif" >
<img src="../../images/int.gif" >
<img src="../../images/cr1.gif" > 
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (14:5-7)

<p>(14:5-6) If you're a gentile, you've only got two choices: become a 
Mormon or fall into the Catholic pit that leads to hell.

<p><i>"If the Gentiles repent it shall be well with them ... [but] whoso repenteth not must perish. Therefore, 
wo be unto the Gentiles if it so be that they harden their hearts against the Lamb of God."</i>

<p>(14:7) The angel tells Nephi that the lamb of God (Jesus) says that the time 
will come (2423 years later) when a 17 year old treasure 
digger from New York (Joseph Smith) will find some golden plates and translate them by staring into his hat at some magic rocks and 
thereby produce the "great and marvelous work" that we now know as the Book of Mormon. This book is, according to the angel, the best 
and most important book by far that you, me, or anyone else will ever read. And we'll be tortured forever after we die unless 
we believe it. 


<p><i>"For the time cometh, saith the Lamb of God, that I will work 
a great and a marvelous work ... a work which shall be everlasting ... either to ... life eternal, or  ... into destruction, 
both temporally and spiritually, according to the captivity of the devil."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/int.gif"  >
<img src="../../images/lang1.gif"  >
<img src="../../images/inj1.gif"  > (14:9) <ruby>The angel shows Nephi the Catholic church again.

<p><i>"Behold that great and abominable church, which is the mother of abominations, 
whose founder is the devil."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/int.gif"  >
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif"  >(14:10) There are only two churches: the church of the Lamb of God 
(The Mormons), and the church of the devil. You either 
belong to the good church or the bad church (the mother of abominations, the whore of all the earth, 
whose founder is the devil).

<p><i>"Behold there are save two 
churches only; the one is the church of the Lamb of God, and the other is the church of the devil; wherefore, whoso belongeth not 
to the church of the Lamb of God belongeth to that great church, which is the mother of abominations; and she is the whore of all 
the earth."</i> 

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif" > (14:11) <br>
the great whore that sitteth upon many waters. -- <a href="../../rev/17.html#1">Revelation 17:1</a><br>
every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people -- <a href="../../rev/14.html#6">Revelation 14:6</a>

<p><img src="../../images/int.gif"  >
<img src="../../images/lang1.gif"  >
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif"  > (14:12) The angel showed Nephi the Mormon church (the church of the 
Lamb of God). There weren't many Mormons, though, because 
of that fucking whore that sat on many waters (the Catholic Church).

<p><i>"I beheld the church of the Lamb of God, and its 
numbers were few, because of the wickedness and abominations of the whore who sat upon many waters."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif" > (14:15) wars and rumours of wars  -- <a href="../../mt/24.html#6">Mt.24:6</a>

<p><img src="../../images/int.gif"  >
<img src="../../images/lang1.gif"  >
<img src="../../images/inj1.gif"  > (14:15-17) God hated pretty much everyone on earth (they were 
all just a bunch of Catholics to him) until the Mormons showed up.

<p><i>"I beheld that the wrath of God was poured out 
upon that great and abominable church ... And as there began to be wars and rumors of wars among all the nations which belonged 
to the mother of abominations ... the mother of harlot ... whose founder is the devil."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif" > (14:16-17)<br>
...the Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth. -- <a href="../../rev/17.html#5">Rev.17:5</a>

<p><img src="../../images/pr1.gif"  >
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif"  > (14:18-22, 27) The angel told Nephi to look over there. You see 
that guy in the white robe? That's the apostle John who will write the 
Book of Revelation about 700 years from now. (Which doesn't make a lot of sense since the apostle John didn't write Revelation,
 but oh well.)

<p><i>"The angel spake unto me, saying: Look! 
And I looked and beheld a man, and he was dressed in a white robe. And the angel said unto me: 
Behold one of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. ... he shall also write concerning the end of the world. ... 
And I, Nephi, heard and bear record, that the name of the apostle of the Lamb was John."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif" > (14:20, 24, 25, 27)
...and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the
        Lamb.  -- <a href="../../rev/21.html#14">Rev.21:14</a>
        
<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"  >
<img src="../../images/pr1.gif"  > 
<img src="../../images/lang1.gif"  >(14:23) The white-robed guy will write things that are just 
and true just like everything else that is written in "the book that proceeded 
out of the mouth of the Jew." ("The book that prceeded out of the mouth of the Jew" is BoM-speak for the Bible.)

<p><i>"Wherefore, the things which he shall write are 
just and true; and behold they are written in the book which thou beheld proceeding out of the mouth of the Jew; and at the 
time they proceeded out of the mouth of the Jew, or, at the time the book proceeded out of the mouth of the Jew, the things which 
were written were plain and pure, and most precious and easy to the understanding of all men."</i>         

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (14:28-30)

<p>(14:28) That's all Nephi is going to say about that. The angel won't let 
him say any more. So don't ask. But the angel showed Nephi 
lots of other cool stuff that he can't tell you about right now.

<p><i>"And behold, I, Nephi, am forbidden that I should write 
the remainder of the things which I saw and heard; wherefore the things which I have written sufficeth me; and I have written but 
a small part of the things which I saw."</i>

<p>(14:30) Finally the angel stopped talking and Nephi quit writing down the 
things that he saw while he got all carried away. But it's all true.

<tr><td><b><a name="1">14:1</b></a>   And <span class="a">it shall come to pass</span>, that <span class="i">if the Gentiles shall 
hearken unto the Lamb of God</span> in that day that he shall manifest himself unto them in word, and also in power, 
in very deed, unto the taking away of their stumbling blocks --  

<tr><td><b><a name="2">14:2</b></a>   And harden not their hearts against the Lamb of God, <span class="i">they shall be 
numbered among the seed of thy father; yea</span>, they shall be numbered among the house of 
Israel; <span class="i">and they shall be a blessed people upon the promised land forever</span>; they shall be 
no more brought down into captivity; and the house of Israel shall no more be 
confounded. 

<tr><td><b><a name="3">14:3</b></a>   And that great pit, which hath been digged for them by 
<span class="i">that great and 
abominable church, which was founded by the devil and his children, that he might lead 
away the souls of men down to hell </span>-- yea, that great pit which hath been digged for the 
destruction of men shall be filled by those who digged it, unto their utter destruction, 
saith the Lamb of God; not the destruction of the soul, save it be the casting of it into 
that hell which hath no end. 

<tr><td><b><a name="4">14:4</b></a>   For behold, this is according to the captivity of the devil, and also 
according to the justice of God, upon all those who will work wickedness and abomination 
before him. 

<tr><td><b><a name="5">14:5</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the angel spake unto 
me, Nephi, saying: Thou hast beheld that <span class="i">if the Gentiles repent it shall be well with 
them</span>; <span class="i">and</span> thou also knowest concerning the covenants of the Lord unto the house of Israel; 
and thou also hast heard that <span class="i">whoso repenteth not must perish.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="6">14:6</b></a>   <span class="i">Therefore, wo be unto the Gentiles if it so be that they harden their 
hearts against the Lamb of God.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="7">14:7</b></a>   <span class="i">For the time cometh, saith the 
Lamb of God, that I will work a great and a marvelous work</span> among the children of men; <span class="i">a 
work which shall be everlasting</span>, either on the one hand or on the other -- <span class="i">either to</span> the 
convincing of them unto peace and <span class="i">life eternal, or</span> unto the deliverance of them to the 
hardness of their hearts and the blindness of their minds unto their being brought down 
into captivity, and also <span class="i">into destruction, both temporally and spiritually, according to 
the captivity of the devil</span>, of which I have spoken. 

<tr><td><b><a name="8">14:8</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when the angel had 
spoken these words, he said unto me: Rememberest thou the covenants of the Father unto the 
house of Israel?  I said unto him, Yea. 

<tr><td valign="top"><b><a name="9">14:9</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that he said 
unto me: Look, and <span class="i">behold that great and abominable church, which is the 
mother of abominations, whose founder is the devil.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="10">14:10</b></a>   And he said unto me: <span class="i">Behold there are 
save two churches only; the one is the church of the Lamb of God, and the other is the 
church of the devil; wherefore, 
whoso belongeth not to the church of the Lamb of God belongeth to that great church, which 
is </span><span class="plag">the mother of abominations</span>; <span class="i">and she is </span><span class="plag">the whore of all the earth</span>.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="11">14:11</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that I looked and beheld 
<span class="plag">the whore of all the earth, and she sat upon many waters</span>; and she had dominion over all 
the earth, among <span class="plag">all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people.
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="12">14:12</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that <span class="i">I 
beheld the church of the Lamb of God, and its numbers were few, because 
of the wickedness and abominations of</span> <span class="plag">the whore who sat upon many waters</span>; nevertheless, I beheld that the church of the Lamb, who 
were the saints of God, were also upon all the face of the earth; and their dominions upon 
the face of the earth were small, because of <span class="i">the wickedness of the great 
whore</span> whom I saw. 

<tr><td><b><a name="13">14:13</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that I 
beheld that <span class="i">the great mother of abominations did gather together 
multitudes upon the face of all the 
earth, among all the nations of the Gentiles, to fight against the Lamb of God.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="14">14:14</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that I, Nephi, beheld the 
power of the Lamb of God, that it descended upon the saints of the church of the Lamb, and 
upon the covenant people of the Lord, who were scattered upon all the face of the earth; 
and they were armed with righteousness and with the power of God in great glory. 

<tr><td><b><a name="15">14:15</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that <span class="i">I 
beheld that the wrath of God was poured out upon that great and abominable 
church</span>, insomuch that there 
were <span class="plag">wars and rumors of wars</span> among all the nations and kindreds of the 
earth. 

<tr><td><b><a name="16">14:16</b></a>   <span class="i">And as there began to be wars and rumors of wars among 
all the nations which belonged to </span><span class="i">the mother of abominations</span>, the 
angel spake unto me, saying: Behold, <span class="i">the wrath of God is upon the mother of 
harlots</span>; and behold, thou seest all these things --  

<tr><td><b><a name="17">14:17</b></a>   And when the day cometh that <span class="i">the wrath of God is poured out upon the 
mother of harlots, which is the great and abominable church of all the earth, whose 
founder is the devil</span>, then, at that day, the work of the Father shall commence, in 
preparing the way for the fulfilling of his covenants, which he hath made to his people 
who are of the house of Israel. 

<tr><td><b><a name="18">14:18</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that <span class="a">the angel spake unto 
me, saying: Look! </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="19">14:19</b></a>   <span class="a">And I looked and beheld a man, and he was dressed in a white 
robe. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="20">14:20</b></a>   <span class="a">And the angel said unto me: Behold one of </span><span class="plag">the twelve 
apostles of the Lamb</span>. 

<tr><td><b><a name="21">14:21</b></a>   Behold, he shall see and write the remainder of these things; yea, 
and also many things which have been. 

<tr><td><b><a name="22">14:22</b></a>   And <span class="a">he shall also write concerning the end of the world.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="23">14:23</b></a>   <span class="a">Wherefore, the things which he shall write are just and true; and 
behold they are written in the book which thou beheld proceeding out of the mouth of the 
Jew; and at the time they proceeded out of the mouth of the Jew, or, at the time the book 
proceeded out of the mouth of the Jew, the things which were written were plain and pure, 
and most precious and easy to the understanding of all men. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="24">14:24</b></a>   And behold, the things which this 
<span class="plag">apostle of the Lamb</span> shall write are 
many things which thou hast seen; and behold, the remainder shalt thou see. 

<tr><td><b><a name="25">14:25</b></a>   But the things which thou shalt see hereafter thou 
shalt not write; for the Lord God hath ordained <span class="plag">the apostle of the Lamb</span> of God that he should write 
them. 

<tr><td><b><a name="26">14:26</b></a>   And also others who have been, to them hath he shown all things, and 
they have written them; and they are sealed up to come forth in their purity, according 
to the truth which is in the Lamb, in the own due time of the Lord, unto the house of 
Israel. 

<tr><td><b><a name="27">14:27</b></a>   <span class="a">And I, Nephi, heard and bear record, that the name of </span>
<span class="plag">the apostle of the Lamb</span><span class="a"> was John</a>, according to the word of the angel. 

<tr><td><b><a name="28">14:28</b></a>   <span class="a">And behold, I, Nephi, am forbidden that I should write the remainder 
of the things which I saw and heard; wherefore the things which I have written sufficeth 
me; and I have written but a small part of the things which I saw. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="29">14:29</b></a>   And I bear record that I saw the things which my father saw, and the 
angel of the Lord did make them known unto me. 

<tr><td><b><a name="30">14:30</b></a>   <span class="a">And now I make an end of speaking concerning the things which I saw 
while I was carried away in the spirit; and if all the things which I saw are not 
written, <span class="c">the things which I have written are true.</span></span>  And thus it is.  Amen.
