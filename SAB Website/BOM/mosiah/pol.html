<p><li>"And even I, myself [me, myself, and I, i.e., Mosiah], have labored with mine own hands that I might serve you, and that ye should not 
be laden with taxes."<br>
(Mosiah was a card-carrying member of the Republican party.) <a href="2.html#14">2:14</a>

<p><li>"Administer of your substance unto him that standeth in need; and ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth
 up his petition to you in vain, and turn him out to perish." <a href="4.html#16">4:16</a>
 
 <p><li>"Ye ought to impart of the substance that ye have one to another." <a href="4.html#21">4:21</a>
 
 <p><li>"Impart of your substance to the poor, every man according to that which he hath, such as feeding the hungry, 
clothing the naked, visiting the sick and administering to their relief." <a href="4.html#26">4:26</a>

<p><li>"And he [Noah] laid a tax of one fifth part of all they possessed."<br>
Since Zeniff was a bad guy (who "did not keep the commandments of the Lord") and he taxed the people 20%, I guess God (or Joseph Smith) didn't 
approve of flat taxes -- or maybe taxes of any kind. <a href="11.html#3">11:3</a>

<p><li>"There should be an equality among all men." <a href="27.html#3">27:3</a>

<p><li>"I desire that this inequality should be no more in this land ... but I desire that this 
land be a land of liberty, and every man may enjoy his rights and privileges alike." <a href="29.html#32">29:32</a>
