<p><li>"And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass,
with the edge of the sword."  <a href="6.html#21">6:21</a>

<p><li>"And Joshua ... took Achan ... and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his sheep... And all of Israel
stoned them with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones." This is because Achan "took
of the accursed thing" -- whatever that means. But why would God require that Achan's sons and daughters (and even his
animals) be stoned to death along with him? The Bible doesn't say. But it does tell us that "the Lord turned from the
fierceness of his anger" when Achan, his children, and his animals were stoned to death and their dead bodies burned. 
 <a href="7.html#24">7:24-26</a>
 
<p><li>Joshua and his army, per God's instructions, slaughter "all the inhabitants of Ai."  <a href="8.html#22">8:22-26</a>

<p><li>Joshua hangs the king of Ai on a tree until evening.  <a href="8.html#29">8:29</a>

<p><li>God slaughters the Amorites and chases them "along the way" as they try to escape. Then he sends down
huge hailstones and kills even more of them. <a href="10.html#10">10:10-11</a>

<p><li>In a divine type of daylight savings time, God makes the sun stand still so that Joshua can get all his killing done
before dark.   <a href="10.html#12">10:12-13</a>

<p><li>Joshua tells his captains to "put your feet upon the necks of these kings." He says, "thus shall the Lord do to all of
your enemies." Then Joshua kills the kings and hangs them on trees.  <a href="10.html#24">10:24-26</a>

<p><li> Joshua, at God's command, kills everyone and everything that he can find (including babies and little children)--
or, as the Bible puts it, he "utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the Lord commanded."  <a href="10.html#28">10:28-32</a>

<p><li>God delivers the Hazorites into Joshua's hand, and he knows just what to do with them: he smites them all with
(you guessed it) the edge of the sword until "there was not any left to breathe."  <a href="11.html#6">11:6-17</a>

<p><li>"For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy
them utterly." Notice that God hardens their hearts so that he can have an excuse to kill them.  <a href="11.html#20">11:20</a>
