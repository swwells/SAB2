<td bgcolor="eeeeee" rowspan="21">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (1:1a) <i>"The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him ... sent ... by his angel
 unto his servant John."</i> The book of Revelation was revealed to Jesus by God and was delivered by an angel to a guy named John.

<p><img src="../images/pr1.gif"> (1:1b, 3) <i>"<b>Things which must shortly come to pass</b> ... <b>The time is at hand.</b>"</i><br>
John believed that the things that he wrote about would happen soon, within his own lifetime. 
After nearly 2000 years, believers still believe that "the time is at hand" and 
that the events described in Revelation will "shortly come to pass."<br>
    <a href="../says_about/end.html">What the Bible says about the end of the world</a>
    
    <p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (1:4) <i>"From the seven Spirits 
    which are before his throne."</i><br> The "seven Spirits" are the seven spirits of God (<a href="4.html#5">4:5</a>)

<img src="../images/interp.gif"> (1:7a) <i>"He cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him."</i> 
Millions have lived and died without ever seeing Jesus descend from the sky. Such an event, if it ever occurred, 
could only be seed by all on a flat earth.<br>
<a href="../contra/seejesus.html">Will Jesus' second coming be visible to all?</a><br>

<p><img src="../images/cr1.gif"> (1:7b) <i>"All kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him."</i><br>
Everyone on earth will wail because of Jesus. 

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (1:10-11) John's vision began when he was in the Spirit on the Lord's day. He heard a loud voice claiming to be 
Jesus, telling him to write a book and send it to seven Asian churches.

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif">
<img src="../images/cr1.gif">
<img src="../images/interp.gif"> (1:12-20) John's Jesus is surrounded by seven golden 
candlesticks. He has white hair, eyes of fire, and feet of brass. He holds seven stars in his hand and has a sword sticking out of his mouth. 
He has the keys of hell and death.

<p>(1:12-13) <i>"I saw seven golden candlesticks. And ...  the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the 
paps with a golden girdle."</i>

<p>(1:14-15) <b><i>"His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire. 
And his feet like unto fine brass."</i></b>

<p>(1:16) <b><i>"He had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword."</i></b>

<p>(1:17) <i>"I am the first and the last."</i><br>
<a href="../contra/Jesus_God.html">Is Jesus God?</a>

<p>(1:18) <b><i>"I ... have the keys of hell and of death."</i></b>

and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches."</i>
