<p><li>"These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing." But no such site is known in
history. Some translations (ASV, NAB, NIV, RSV, NRSV) rename Bethabara as Bethany, but Bethany is a suburb of
Jerusalem and, therefore, not "beyond the Jordan."  <a href="1.html#28">1:28</a>

<p><li> Jesus had remote viewing skills. <a href="1.html#48">1:48-50</a>

<p><li>"The wind bloeth where it listeth."<br>
    Jesus says that no one knows which way the wind is blowing. But, of course, he was wrong about that. The 
    direction and speed of the wind are easily measured. <a href="3.html#8">3:8</a>
    
<p><li>"If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye
    believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?"<br> Good question, Jesus!
    He was wrong about creation in <a href="../mk/10.html#6">Mk 10:6</a>, wrong about the flood in
     <a href="../lk/17.html#26">Lk 17:26-27</a>, and wrong about the smallest seed in <a href="../mt/13.html#31">Mt 13:31-32</a>. 
     So why would anyone believe him when he talks about heaven in <a href="3.html#16">Jn 3:16</a>? 
 <a href="3.html#12">3:12</a>
 
 <p><li>Jesus heals a nobleman's son. <a href="4.html#46">4:46-51</a>      
 
<p><li>Whoever enters a pool after it is stirred up by angels will be cured of "whatsoever disease he had." 
 <a href="5.html#4">5:4</a>
 
 <p><li>Jesus cures a paralytic man. <a href="5.html#5">5:5-9</a>    
 
 <p><li>Jesus believes people are crippled by God as a punishment for sin. He tells a crippled man, after healing him, to
"sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee."  <a href="5.html#14">5:14</a>

<p><li>The disciples ask Jesus about the cause of a man's blindness. Was it because he or his parents sinned? Jesus said neither 
    had sinned. The man was born blind so that Jesus could show off his powers by curing him of his blindness.   
     <a href="9.html#1">9:1-3</a>
     
<p><li>Jesus spits on the ground, mixes his spit with the dirt, and rubs the muddy spit on (or in?) a blind man's eyes. 
Then he told him to wash in the pool of Siloam. After that, the blind man could see again. 
The Bible doesn't say whether it was the holy spit, holy mud, or holy water that did the trick. <a href="9.html#6">9:6-7</a>

<p><li>"Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit."<br>
Jesus was wrong about seeds. If a seed dies, it dies. It only produces a new plant if it stays alive (in a dormant stage) until 
it germinates. Dead seeds bring forth no fruit. <a href="12.html#24">12:24</a>
