	<img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (8:2-3) Tobias, per Raphael's instructions, barbecued some fish liver on coals. Then Raphael took the devil to an Egyptian desert and tied him up.
	
	<p>(8:2) <i>"Tobias remembering the angel's word, took out of his bag part of the liver, and laid it upon burning coals."</i>
	
	<p>(8:3) <i>"Then the angel Raphael took the devil, and bound him in the desert of upper Egypt."</i>
	
	<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (8:4) <i>"Then Tobias exhorted the virgin, and said to her: Sara, arise, and let us pray to God today, and tomorrow, and the next day: because for these three nights we are 
joined to God: and when the third night is over, we will be in our own wedlock."</i><br>
Tobias tells "the virgin" that their honeymoon will consist of praying for three days, then they can have sex. I'm not sure how Sara could be a virgin after being married seven times, but I guess the devil killed her 
husbands before they got the job done.

<tr><td><B><A name="7">8:7</a></b> And Tobias said: Lord God of our father, may the heavens and the earth, and the sea, and the fountains, and the rivers, and all thy creatures that are in them, bless thee. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Tobias tells God that he is having sex with his "sister" (first cousin, actually) only for procreation.  

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (8:11-12) Raguel tells his slaves to dig a grave for husband number eight.

in which thy name may be blessed for ever and ever. 

<tr><td><B><A name="10">8:10</a></b> Sara also said: Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us, and let us grow old both together in health.

<tr><td><B><A name="11">8:11</a></b> And it came to pass about the cockcrowing, 
	<span class="a">Raguel ordered his servants to be called for, and they went with him together to dig a grave.

	</span> 
<tr><td><B><A name="13">8:13</a></b> And when they had prepared the pit, Raguel went back to his wife, and said to her: 

<tr><td><B><A name="14">8:14</a></b> Send one of thy maids, and let her see if he be dead, that I may bury him before it be day. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><B><A name="15">8:15</a></b> So she sent one of her maidservants, who went into the chamber, and found them safe and sound, sleeping both together.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><B><A name="16">8:16</a></b> And returning she brought the good news: and Raguel and Anna his wife blessed the Lord, <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><B><A name="17">8:17</a></b> And said: We bless thee, O Lord God of Israel, because it hath not happened as we suspected. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><B><A name="18">8:18</a></b> For thou hast shewn thy mercy to us, and hast shut out from us the enemy that persecuted us. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><B><A name="19">8:19</a></b> And thou hast taken pity upon two only children. Make them, O Lord, bless thee more fully: and to offer up to thee a sacrifice of thy praise, 
and of their health, that all nations may know, that thou alone art God in all the earth. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><B><A name="20">8:20</a></b> And immediately Raguel commanded his servants, to fill up the pit they had made, before it was day.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><B><A name="21">8:21</a></b> And he spoke to his wife to make ready a feast, and prepare all kind of provisions that are necessary for such as go a journey. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><B><A name="22">8:22</a></b> He caused also two fat kine, and four wethers to be killed, and a banquet to be prepared for all his neighbours, and all his friends. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><B><A name="24">8:24</a></b> And of all things which Raguel possessed, he gave one half to Tobias, and made him a writing, 
that the half that remained should after their decease come also to Tobias.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
