Jerusalem still wasn't satisfied after having sex with the the well-endowed Egyptians

men to "come in unto [her] on every side."

yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied."</i>

God calls Jerusalem "an imperious whorish woman."

After exposing her nakedness, God will give her "blood in fury and jealousy" and strip her naked once
