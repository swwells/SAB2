"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",
"<span class='i'>Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever.</span>--<a href='3.html#14'>Alma 3:14</a>",
"<span class='i'>I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</span>--<a href='3.html#15'>Alma 3:15</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",
"<span class='a'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges ... even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year....</span>--<a href='16.html#1'>Alma 16:1</a>",
"<span class='a'>Their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.</span>--<a href='16.html#11'>Alma 16:11</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.   Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</span>--<a href='30.html#22'>Alma 30:22</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",

"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",

"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",
"<span class='i'>These dissenters ... became ... more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='47.html#36'>Alma 47:36</a>",
"<span class='a'>God would prosper them in the land, or in other words ... God ... would prosper them in the land.</span>--<a href='48.html#15'>Alma 48:15</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='50.html#22'>Alma 50:22</a>",
"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",
"<span class='i'>The remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty.</span>--<a href='51.html#20'>Alma 51:20</a>",
"<span class='g'>And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye.</span>--<a href='54.html#21'>Alma 54:21</a>",

<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>49:1</b>   <span class="a">And now it came to pass</span> in the eleventh month of the nineteenth year, on the tenth day of the 
month, the armies of the Lamanites were seen approaching towards the land of Ammonihah. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1"><a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass </a><br>
[49:1, 9, 17, 21, 25(2), 26, 28]
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>49:2</b>   And behold, the city had been rebuilt, and Moroni had stationed an army by the borders of the 
city, and they had cast up dirt around about to shield them from the arrows and the stones of the Lamanites; 
for behold, they fought with stones and with arrows. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>49:3</b>   Behold, I said that the city of Ammonihah had been rebuilt.  I say unto you, yea, that it was in 
part rebuilt; and because the Lamanites had destroyed it once because of the iniquity of the people, they 
supposed that it would again become an easy prey for them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>49:4</b>   But behold, how great was their disappointment; for behold, the Nephites had dug up a ridge 
of earth round about them, which was so high that the Lamanites could not cast their stones and their arrows 
at them that they might take effect, neither could they come upon them save it was by their place of entrance. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>49:5</b>   Now at this time the chief captains of the Lamanites were 
astonished <span class="a">exceedingly</span>, because of the wisdom of the Nephites in preparing their places 
of security. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1"><a href="exceed_list.html">Exceedingly</a><br>
(49:5, 9, 17, 26, 27, 30) 
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>49:6</b>   Now the leaders of the Lamanites had supposed, because of the greatness of their numbers, yea, 
they supposed that they should be privileged to come upon them as they had hitherto done; yea, and they had also 
prepared themselves with shields, and with breastplates; and they had also prepared themselves with garments of 
skins, yea, very thick garments to cover their nakedness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>49:7</b>   And being thus prepared they supposed that they should easily overpower and subject their brethren 
to the yoke of bondage, or slay and massacre them according to their pleasure. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>49:8</b>   But behold, to their uttermost astonishment, they were prepared for them, in a manner which never 
had been known among the children of Lehi.  Now they were prepared for the 
Lamanites, to battle after the manner of the instructions of Moroni. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>49:9</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Lamanites, or the Amalickiahites, 
were <span class="a">exceedingly</span> astonished at their manner of preparation for war. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>49:10</b>   Now, if king Amalickiah had come down out of the land of Nephi, at the head of his army, perhaps 
he would have caused the Lamanites to have attacked the Nephites at the city of Ammonihah; for behold, he did care 
not for the blood of his people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>49:11</b>   But behold, Amalickiah did not come down himself to battle.   And behold, his chief captains 
durst not attack the Nephites at the city of Ammonihah, for Moroni had altered the management of affairs among 
the Nephites, insomuch that the Lamanites were disappointed in their places of retreat and they could not come 
upon them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>49:12</b>   Therefore they retreated into the wilderness, and took their camp and marched towards the 
land of Noah, supposing that to be the next best place for them to come against the Nephites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>49:13</b>   For they knew not that Moroni had fortified, or had built forts of security, for every city in 
all the land round about; therefore, they marched forward to the land of Noah with a firm determination; yea, 
their chief captains came forward and took an oath that they would destroy the people of that city. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>49:14</b>   But behold, to their astonishment, the city of Noah, which had hitherto been a weak place, 
had now, by the means of Moroni, become strong, yea, even to exceed the strength of the city Ammonihah. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>49:15</b>   And now, behold, this was wisdom in Moroni; for he had supposed that they would be frightened 
at the city Ammonihah; and as the city of Noah had hitherto been the weakest part of the land, therefore they 
would march thither to battle; and thus it was according to his desires. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>49:16</b>   And behold, Moroni had appointed Lehi to be chief captain 
over the men of that city; and it was that same Lehi who fought with the 
Lamanites in the valley on the east of the river Sidon. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>49:17</b>   <span class="a">And now behold it came to pass</span>, that when the Lamanites had found 
that Lehi commanded the city they were again disappointed, for they 
feared Lehi <span class="a">exceedingly</span>; nevertheless their chief 
captains had sworn with an oath to attack the city; therefore, they brought up their armies. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>49:18</b>   Now behold, the Lamanites could not get into their forts of security by any other way save 
by the entrance, because of the highness of the bank which had been thrown up, and the depth of the ditch 
which had been dug round about, save it were by the entrance. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>49:19</b>   And thus were the Nephites prepared to destroy all such as should attempt to climb up to enter 
the fort by any other way, by casting over stones and arrows at them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>49:20</b>   Thus they were prepared, yea, a body of their strongest men, with their swords and their 
slings, to smite down all who should attempt to come into their place of security by the place of entrance; 
and thus were they prepared to defend themselves against the Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>49:21</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the captains of the Lamanites brought up their 
armies before the place of entrance, and began to contend with the Nephites, to get into their place of 
security; but behold, they were driven back from time to time, insomuch that they were slain with an 
immense slaughter. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>49:22</b>   Now when they found that they could not obtain power over the Nephites by the pass, they began 
to dig down their banks of earth that they might obtain a pass to their armies, that they might have an equal 
chance to fight; but behold, in these attempts they were swept off by the stones and arrows which were thrown 
at them; and instead of filling up their ditches by pulling down the banks of earth, they were filled up in a 
measure with their dead and wounded bodies. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>49:23</b>   Thus the Nephites had all power over their enemies; and thus the Lamanites did attempt to 
destroy the Nephites until their chief captains were all slain; yea, and more than a thousand of the Lamanites 
were slain; while, on the other hand, there was not a single soul of the Nephites which was slain. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>49:24</b>   There were about fifty who were wounded, who had been exposed to the arrows of the Lamanites 
through the pass, but they were shielded by their shields, and their breastplates, and their head-plates, 
insomuch that their wounds were upon their legs, many of which were very severe. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>49:25</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span>, that when the Lamanites saw that their chief 
captains were all slain they fled into the wilderness.  <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they 
returned to the land of Nephi, to inform their king, Amalickiah, who was a Nephite by birth, concerning 
their great loss. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>49:26</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that he was <span class="a">exceedingly</span> 
angry with his people, because he had not obtained his desire over the Nephites; he had not subjected them to 
the yoke of bondage. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>49:27</b>   Yea, he was <span class="a">exceedingly</span> wroth, and he did 
curse God, and also Moroni, swearing with <span class="a">an oath that he would drink his blood; and this because Moroni had kept 
the commandments of God</span> in preparing for the safety of his people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32"><br>
<font size="-1">Amalickiah "was exceedingly wroth" and swore the he would drink Moroni's blood "because Moroni had kept 
the commandments of God." 
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>49:28</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span>, that on the other hand, the people of Nephi did thank 
the Lord their God, because of his matchless power in delivering them from the hands of their enemies. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>49:29</b>   And thus ended the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">


<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>49:30</b>   Yea, and there was continual peace among them, and <span class="a">exceedingly</span> great 
prosperity in the church because of their heed and diligence which they gave unto the word of God, which was 
declared unto them by Helaman, and Shiblon, and Corianton, and Ammon and his brethren, yea, and by all those 
who had been ordained by the holy order of God, being baptized unto repentance, and sent forth to preach among 
the people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
