suffering must have made God very happy.  <a href="7.html#5">7:5</a>

<p><li>God kills the king of Israel and helps Abijah kill 500,000 Israelites. "The children of Judah prevailed,

<p><li>Whoever that does not seek the God of Israel should be executed.  <a href="15.html#13">15:13</a>

<p><li>God told Jehu to kill everyone in the house of Ahab (and then later condemned him for 
it (<a href="../hos/1.html#4">Hosea 1:4</a>)). <a href="22.html#7">22:7-9</a>

<p><li>Amaziah (who "did that which was right in the sight of the Lord") killed 10,000 people; another

<a href="25.html#1">25:1-2, 11-12</a>

<p><li>God sent an angel to kill the Assyrian army. (According to 
<a href="../2kg/19.html#35">2 Kings 19:35</a> the angel killed 185,000 sleeping soldiers who 
woke the next morning to discover that they were dead.) <a href="32.html#21">32:21</a>

 <p><li>God vows to "bring evil upon this place ... even all the curses that are written in the book." He says his
"wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched."  <a href="34.html#24">34:24-25, 28</a>

<p><li>God gets angry with his people, so he sends the king of the Chaldees to kill all the "young men with the
sword." He has compassion for no one, not even old men that are "stooped for age." In his tender mercy and loving
kindness he has them all slaughtered.  <a href="36.html#16">36:16-17</a>
