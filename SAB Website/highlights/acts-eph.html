  <p><li>He blinded the Jews so they wouldn't recognize Jesus as the Messiah. <A href="../rom/11.html#7" target="_top" >11:7-10</A>
  
  <p><li>Jews are Paul's enemies, but he loves them for their ancestors' sakes. <a href="../rom/11.html#28" target="_top">11:28</a>
  
  <p><li>Gentiles used to be unbelievers, but now the Jews are the unbelievers and God saves gentiles through Jewish unbelief. <a href="../rom/11.html#30" target="_top">11:30</a>
