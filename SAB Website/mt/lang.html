<p><li>While insulting the Pharisees and Sadducees, John the Baptist calls an entire generation a "generation 
of vipers." <a href="3.html#7">3:7</a>

<p><li> Jesus often called people names. One of his favorites was to call his adversaries a "generation of vipers." 
 <a href="12.html#34">12:34</a>
 
<p><li>The ever-so-kind Jesus calls the Pharisees "hypocrites, wicked, and adulterous." Why? For asking for some 
evidence that Jesus is who he claims to be.  <a href="16.html#3">16:3-4</a>
 
<p><li>When Peter expressed his dismay when Jesus announced his coming death, Jesus said to 
him "Get thee behind me, Satan" -- a fine way to address his holiness, the first pope!  <a href="16.html#23">16:23</a>

<p><li>Jesus speaks harshly of his disciples when they fail to cast out the devil, saying "O faithless and 
perverse generation, how long shall I be with you?"  <a href="17.html#17">17:17</a>

<p><li>Jesus calls his critics fools, hypocrites, serpents, vipers, killers of the prophets, and just about every 
other name he can think of.  <a href="23.html#13">23:13-37</a>
