<img src="../../images/sci1.gif"> (6:1-2) <br><i>"Tobias ... went out to wash his feet, and behold a monstrous fish came up to devour him."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif">
<img src="../../images/sci1.gif"> (6:5) <i>"The angel said to him: Take out the entrails of the fish, and lay up his heart, and his gall, and his liver for thee: for these are necessary for useful medicines."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif">
<img src="../../images/sci1.gif"> (6:8-9) <i>Alternative Medicine</i><br>
The smoke of fish intestines drives away all kinds of devils, and a little fish gall rubbed in the eye cures white spots.

<p>(6:8) <i>"If thou put a little piece of its heart upon coals, the smoke thereof driveth away all kind of devils, either from man or from woman, so that they come no more to them."</i>

<p>(6:9) <i>"And the gall is good for anointing the eyes, in which there is a white speck, and they shall be cured."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/wom1.gif"> (6:11-13) Raphael tells Tobias Jr. that he must marry Sara, whom he has never met. It doesn't matter what she thinks about it. Just ask her dad and he'll give her to you.

<p>(6:11-12) <i>"Here is one whose name is Raguel, a near kinsman of thy tribe, and he hath a daughter named Sara ... thou must take her to wife."</i>

<p>(6:13) <i>"Ask her therefore of her father, and he will give her thee to wife."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (6:14-15) Although Tobias has never met Sara, he has heard about her. Isn't she the woman that had seven husbands that were killed by devils?

<p>(6:14) <i>"Tobias ... said: I hear that she hath been given to seven husbands, and they all died: moreover I have heard, that a devil killed them."</i>

<p>(6:15) <i>"Now I am afraid, lest the same thing should happen to me."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif">
<img src="../../images/sex1.gif">
<img src="../../images/fv.gif"> (6:16-22) Raphael tells Tobias Jr. not to worry. Devils only kill godless husbands that want to have sex all the time like they were horses 
or mules or something. 
When you and Sara get married, abstain from sex and pray constantly for three days. Then burn some fish liver on a fire; that will drive the husband-killing devils away. Then after the third night, go ahead and have sex with 
her. Just make sure you're doing it for "love of children" instead of lust and you'll get her pregnant on the first try.

<p>(6:16) <i>"Raphael said ... I will shew thee who they are, over whom the devil can prevail."</i>

<p>(6:17) <i>"They who ... receive matrimony, as to shut out God from themselves, and from their mind, 
and to give themselves to their lust, as the horse and mule, which have not understanding, over them the devil hath power."</i>

<p>(6:18) <i>"When thou shalt take her ... for three days keep thyself continent from her, and give thyself to nothing else but to prayers with her. "</i>

<p>(6:19) <i>"And on that night lay the liver of the fish on the fire, and the devil shall be driven away."</i>

<p>(6:22) <i>"When the third night is past, thou shalt take the virgin with the fear of the Lord, moved rather for love of children than for lust, that ... thou mayst obtain a blessing in children. "</i>

<tr><td><B><A name="1">6:1</a></B> And <span class="a">Tobias</span> went forward, and the dog followed him, and he lodged the first night by the river of Tigris. 

<tr><td><B><A name="2">6:2</a></b> And he <span class="a">went out to wash his feet, and behold a monstrous fish came up to devour him.</span>

<tr><td><B><A name="3">6:3</a></b> And Tobias being afraid of him, cried out with a loud voice, saying: Sir, he cometh upon me. 

<tr><td><B><A name="4">6:4</a></b> And the angel said to him: Take him by the gill, and draw him to thee. And when he had done so, he drew him out upon the land, and he began to pant before his feet. 

<tr><td><B><A name="5">6:5</a></b> Then <span class="a">the angel said to him: Take out the entrails of the fish, and lay up his heart, and his gall, and his liver for thee: for these are necessary for useful medicines.
	</span>

<tr><td><B><A name="6">6:6</a></b> And when he had done so, he roasted the flesh thereof, and they took it with them in the way: the rest they salted as much as might serve them, till they 
came to Rages the city of the Medes. 

<tr><td><B><A name="7">6:7</a></b> Then Tobias asked the angel, and said to him: I beseech thee, brother Azarias, tell me what remedies are these things good for, which thou hast bid me keep of the fish? 

<tr><td><B><A name="8">6:8</a></b> And the angel, answering, said to him: 
	<span class="a">If thou put a little piece of its heart upon coals, the smoke thereof driveth away all kind of devils, either from man or from woman,
 so that they come no more to them. </span>

 but he hath no son nor any other daughter beside her.
