  <i>"Until the day that Noe

  Jesus believed the story of Noah's ark. He thought it really happened and had no problem with 
  the idea of God drowning everything and everybody. <br>

Jesus also believes the story about Sodom's destruction. He says, "even thus shall it be in
the day the son of man is revealed." This tells us
about Jesus' knowledge of science and history, and his sense of justice.
