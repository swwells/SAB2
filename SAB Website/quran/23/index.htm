Who will inherit paradise. There they will abide. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="12"><b>23:12</a></b>
Verily We created man from a product of wet earth; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="13"><b>23:13</a></b>
Then placed him as a drop (of seed) in a safe lodging; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="14"><b>23:14</a></b>
Then fashioned We the drop a clot, then fashioned We the clot a little lump,  then fashioned We the little lump bones, then clothed the bones with flesh, and then  produced it as another creation. So blessed be Allah, the Best of creators! <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="15"><b>23:15</a></b>

Then lo! after that ye surely die. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="16"><b>23:16</a></b>
Then lo! on the Day of Resurrection ye are raised (again). <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="17"><b>23:17</a></b>
And We have created above you seven paths, and We are never unmindful of  creation. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="18"><b>23:18</a></b>
And we send down from the sky water in measure, and We give it lodging in  the earth, and lo! We are Able to withdraw it. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="19"><b>23:19</a></b>
Then We produce for you therewith gardens of date-palms and grapes,  wherein is much fruit for you and whereof ye eat; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><a NAME="20"><b>23:20</a></b>
And a tree that springeth forth from Mount Sinai that groweth oil and relish  for the eaters. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="21"><b>23:21</a></b>
And lo! in the cattle there is verily a lesson for you. We give you to drink of  that which is in their bellies, and many uses have ye in them, and of them do ye eat; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="22"><b>23:22</a></b>
And on them and on the ship ye are carried. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="23"><b>23:23</a></b>
And We verily sent Noah unto his folk, and he said: O my people! Serve  Allah. Ye have no other God save Him. Will ye not ward off (evil) ? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="24"><b>23:24</a></b>

But the chieftains of his folk, who disbelieved, said: This is only a mortal  like you who would make himself superior to you. Had Allah willed, He surely could  have sent down angels. We heard not of this in the case of our fathers of old. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="25"><b>23:25</a></b>
He is only a man in whom is a madness, so watch him for a while. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="26"><b>23:26</a></b>
He said: My Lord! Help me because they deny me. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><a NAME="27"><b>23:27</a></b>
Then We inspired in him, saying: Make the ship under Our eyes and Our  inspiration. Then, 
when Our command cometh and the oven gusheth water, introduce  therein of every (kind) 
two spouses, and thy household save him thereof against  whom the Word hath already gone 
forth. And <span class="i">plead not with Me on behalf of those  who have done wrong. Lo! they will be 
drowned.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/inj1.gif" >
<img src="../../images/cr1.gif" >
<font size="-1">Allah told Noah not to bother pleading for the people he was about to drown.</font>

<tr><td><a NAME="28"><b>23:28</a></b>
And when thou art on board the ship, thou and whoso is with thee, then say:  Praise be to Allah Who hath saved us from the wrongdoing folk! <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><a NAME="29"><b>23:29</a></b>
And say: My Lord! Cause me to land at a blessed landing-place, for Thou art  Best of all who bring to land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="30"><b>23:30</a></b>
Lo! herein verily are portents, for lo! We are ever putting (mankind) to the  test. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="31"><b>23:31</a></b>
Then, after them, We brought forth another generation; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="32"><b>23:32</a></b>
And we sent among them a messenger of their own, saying: Serve Allah, Ye  have no other God save Him. Will ye not ward off (evil) ? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="33"><b>23:33</a></b>

And the chieftains of his folk, who disbelieved and denied the meeting of the  Hereafter, and whom We had made soft in the life of the world, said: This is only a  mortal like you, who eateth of that whereof ye eat and drinketh of that ye drink. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="34"><b>23:34</a></b>
If ye were to obey a mortal like yourselves, then, lo! ye surely would be  losers. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="35"><b>23:35</a></b>
Doth he promise you that you, when ye are dead and have become dust and  bones, will (again) be brought forth ? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="36"><b>23:36</a></b>
Begone, begone, with that which ye are promised! <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="37"><b>23:37</a></b>
There is naught but our life of the world; we die and we live, and we shall  not be raised (again). <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><a NAME="38"><b>23:38</a></b>
He is only a man who hath invented a lie about Allah. We are not going to  put faith in him. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="39"><b>23:39</a></b>
He said: My Lord! Help me because they deny me. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="40"><b>23:40</a></b>
He said: In a little while they surely will become repentant. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="41"><b>23:41</a></b>
So the (Awful) Cry overtook them rightfully, and We made them like as  wreckage (that a torrent hurleth). A far removal for wrongdoing folk! <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="42"><b>23:42</a></b>

Then after them We brought forth other generations. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="43"><b>23:43</a></b>
No nation can outstrip its term, nor yet postpone it. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="44"><b>23:44</a></b>
Then We sent our messengers one after another. Whenever its messenger  came unto a nation they denied him; so We caused them to follow one another (to  disaster) and We made them bywords. A far removal for folk who believe not! <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="45"><b>23:45</a></b>
Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our tokens and a clear  warrant <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="46"><b>23:46</a></b>
Unto Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they scorned (them) and they were despotic  folk. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><a NAME="47"><b>23:47</a></b>
And they said: Shall we put faith in two mortals like ourselves, and whose  folk are servile unto us ? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="48"><b>23:48</a></b>
So they denied them, and became of those who were destroyed. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="49"><b>23:49</a></b>
And We verily gave Moses the Scripture, that haply they might go aright. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="50"><b>23:50</a></b>
And We made the son of Mary and his mother a portent, and We gave them  refuge on a height, a place of flocks and watersprings. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="51"><b>23:51</a></b>

O ye messengers! Eat of the good things, and do right. Lo! I am Aware of  what ye do. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="52"><b>23:52</a></b>
And lo! this your religion is one religion and I am your Lord, so keep your  duty unto Me. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="53"><b>23:53</a></b>
But they (mankind) have broken their religion among them into sects, each  group rejoicing in its tenets. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="54"><b>23:54</a></b>
So leave them in their error till a time. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="55"><b>23:55</a></b>
Think they that in the wealth and sons wherewith We provide them <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><a NAME="56"><b>23:56</a></b>
We hasten unto them with good things ? Nay, but they perceive not. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="57"><b>23:57</a></b>
Lo! those who go in awe for fear of their Lord. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="58"><b>23:58</a></b>
And those who believe in the revelations of their Lord, <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="59"><b>23:59</a></b>
And those who ascribe not partners unto their Lord, <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="60"><b>23:60</a></b>

And those who give that which they give with hearts afraid because they are  about to return unto their Lord, <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="61"><b>23:61</a></b>
These race for the good things, and they shall win them in the race. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="62"><b>23:62</a></b>
And we task not any soul beyond its scope, and with Us is a Record which  speaketh the truth, and they will not be wronged. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="63"><b>23:63</a></b>
Nay, but their hearts are in ignorance of this (Qur'an), and they have other  works, besides, which they are doing; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="64"><b>23:64</a></b>
Till when We grasp their luxurious ones with the punishment, behold! they  supplicate. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><a NAME="65"><b>23:65</a></b>
Supplicate not this day! Assuredly ye will not be helped by Us. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="66"><b>23:66</a></b>
My revelations were recited unto you, but ye used to turn back on your heels, <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="67"><b>23:67</a></b>
In scorn thereof. Nightly did ye rave together. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="68"><b>23:68</a></b>
Have they not pondered the Word, or hath that come unto them which came  not unto their fathers of old ? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="69"><b>23:69</a></b>

Or know they not their messenger, and so reject him ? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><a NAME="70"><b>23:70</a></b>
Or say they: <span class="a">There is a madness in him</span> ? Nay, but he bringeth them the  Truth; and most of them are haters of the Truth. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (23:70) <i>"There is a madness in him [Muhammad]."</i>

<tr><td><a NAME="71"><b>23:71</a></b>
And if the Truth had followed their desires, verily the heavens and the earth  and whosoever is therein had been corrupted. Nay, We have brought them their  Reminder, but from their Reminder they now turn away. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="72"><b>23:72</a></b>
Or dost thou ask of them (O Muhammad) any tribute ? But the bounty of thy  Lord is better, for He is Best of all who make provision. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="73"><b>23:73</a></b>
And lo! thou summonest them indeed unto a straight path. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><a NAME="74"><b>23:74</a></b>
And lo! <span class="i">those who believe not in the Hereafter are indeed astray from

Already have We grasped them with punishment, but they humble not  themselves unto their Lord, nor do they pray, <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
