<p><li> "The Lord our God will require our blood of the afflictions of our enemies, and he will humble all the nations that shall 
rise up against us, and bring them to disgrace." <a href="8.html#20">8:20</a>

<p><li>The Israelites murmured against the Lord, so 
<a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2009/07/gods-23rd-killing-god-sends-fiery.html">God sent snakes to bite and kill them</a>. 
<a href="8.html#24">8:24-25</a>

<p><li>"O Lord God of my father Simeon, who gavest him a sword to execute vengeance against strangers, who had defiled by their uncleanness, 
and uncovered the virgin unto confusion: And who gavest their wives to be made a prey, and their daughters into captivity ... who were 
zealous with thy zeal: assist ... me."<br>
God not only approved of the Shechem massacre, he gave Simeon the sword to do it with. Judith asks God to help her to go and do likewise. 
<a href="9.html#2">9:2-3</a>

<p><li>"Give me constancy in my mind, that I may despise him ... For this will be a glorious monument for thy name, when 
	he shall fall by the hand of a woman." <a href="9.html#14">9:14-15</a>
	
<p><li>Judith, with God's approval and assistance, decapitated Holfernes while he slept. <a href="13.html#2">13:2-11</a>

<p><li>Judith shows off the head of Holofernes, assuring everyone that no sex was involved in the 
performance of the murderous deed. <a href="13.html#17">13:17-20</a>

<p><li>"God ... hath cut off the head of all the unbelievers this night by my hand." <a href="13.html#27">13:27-20</a>

<p><li>Judith tells the Israelites to hang Holofernes' head up on the wall. <a href="14.html#1">14:1</a>

<p><li>Judith tells the Israelite army that the Assyrian captains will freak out when the see the headless Holofernes 
wallowing about in his own blood. That's when, she says, the Israelites should attack, knowing that God will kill the 
Assyrians for them. <a href="14.html#4">14:4-5</a>

<p><li>The Israelites hang Holofernes head on the wall, gathered their weapons, and set out "with a great noise and shouting." 
<a href="14.html#7">14:7</a>

<p><li>The Assyrian army ran away after hearing about the headless Holfernes, and the Israelites (with God's help) 
slaughtered them as they ran, taking all their stuff and giving it to Judith -- the forever blessed, glory of Jerusalem and joy of Israel. 
(God gave Judith the strength to behead a sleeping man to reward her for not having sex after her husband died.) 
<a href="15.html#1">15:1-15</a>

<p><li>Judith sings a song of praise to herself for cutting off a sleeping man's head. <a href="16.html#1">16:1-28</a>
