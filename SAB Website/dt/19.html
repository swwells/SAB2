(19:11-13) A murderer is to be killed by "the avenger of blood," which is the victim's nearest relative.

<p>(19:11) <i>"If any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite
    him mortally that he die."</i>
    
<p>(19:12) <i>"Then the elders of his
    city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the
    avenger of blood, that he may die."</i>
    
<p>(19:13) <b><i>"Thine eye shall not  pity him."</i></b>

<p><img src="../images/interp.gif" > (19:15) <i>"One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, 
or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established."</i><br>
Jehovah's Witnesses use this verse 
(along with <a href="../1tim/5.html#19">1 Tim.5:19</a>, <a href="../2cor/13.html#1">2 Cor.13:1</a>,
 and <a href="../mt/18.html#16">Mt.18:16</a>) 
to justify their refusal to report or investigate incidents of child molestation unless two or three 
JWs have witnessed the event. If witnesses do not come forward (and they are 
discouraged from doing so since it would embarrass the organization), then the 
victim is told to be quiet about it -- or risk being disfellowshipped.

<p><img src="../images/cr1.gif" >
<img src="../images/inj1.gif" > (19:18-19) False witnesses are to be executed.
 
<p>(19:18) <i>"If the witness be a false witness,"</i>

<p>(19:19) <i>"Then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his brother."</i>

<p><img src="../images/cr1.gif" >
<img src="../images/inj1.gif" > (19:21)
