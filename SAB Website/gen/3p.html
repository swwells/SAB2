<img src="../images/interp.gif" > (3:1) <b><i>"The serpent ... said unto the woman."</i></b><br>
A clever serpent talks to Eve about trees, death, and the knowledge of good 
and evil. He persuades her to eat the forbidden fruit. She takes the first bite and
gets the full blame (<a href="3.html#12">3:12</a>, <a href="3.html#16">16</a>).<br>
<a href="../interp/serpent.html">The serpent</a>

 make one wise, she ... did eat."</i><br>

<p><img src="../images/contra1.gif" >(3:6) <i>"And he did eat."</i><br>
In <a href="2.html#17">2:17</a> God said that if Adam eats from the tree of the knowledge of good and 
evil, then the day that he does so, he will die. But Adam eats the forbidden fruit and yet lives for 
another 930 years (<a href="5.html#5">5:5</a>).

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif" >
<img src="../images/contra1.gif" > (3:8-11) <br><i>"They heard the  voice of the LORD God walking in the garden."</i><br>
    God walks and talks (to himself?) in the
garden, and plays a little hide and seek with Adam and Eve.<br>
<a href="../contra/spirit.html" >Does God have a body?</a><br>
<a href="../contra/knows.html" >Does God know everything?</a> 

<p><img src="../images/wom1.gif" >(3:12-13) <br><i>"The woman ... gave me of the tree.... The 
serpent beguiled me."</i><br>    
Adam blames Eve and Eve blames the serpent.

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif" >
<img src="../images/sci1.gif" > (3:14) <br><i>"Upon
    thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat."</i><br>
God curses the serpent. From now on he will crawl on his belly and eat dust.

    <img src="../images/inj1.gif" > (3:16)
    <b><i>"In sorrow thou shalt bring forth children. ... Thy husband ... shall rule over thee."</i></b><br>
    God punishes Eve, and all women after her, with the pains of childbirth and subjection to men.  <br>
    <a href="../says_about/womens_rights.html">What the Bible says about women's rights</a>

<p><img src="../images/wom1.gif" > (3:17) <i>"Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife"</i><br>
    Adam is also punished, although less severely. He now will have to work for a living because he 
    "hearkened unto the voice" of his wife.
     <p><img src="../images/abs1.gif" >
    <img src="../images/sci1.gif" > (3:17-18) <i>"Thorns and thistles shall it 
    bring forth"</i><br>
But God is not done cursing yet. He curses
the ground and causes thorns and thistles to grow. Before this, according to the (false) Genesis story, plants had no 
natural defenses. The rose had no thorn, cacti were spineless, and nettles had no sting. 
Foxgloves, oleander, and milkweeds were perfectly safe to eat.

    <a href="../contra/everyone.html">Is everyone descended from Adam and Eve?</a>
    
    <p><img src="../images/abs1.gif" > (3:21) <i>"The LORD God make coats of skins"</i><br>
God kills some animals and makes some skin coats for Adam and Eve.

<p> <img src="../images/abs1.gif" >
     <img src="../images/contra1.gif" >(3:22-24) <b><i>"Behold, the man is become as one of us."</i></b><br>     
God expels Adam and Eve from the garden before
they get a chance to eat from that other tree -- the tree of life. God knows
that if they do that, they will live forever. A spooky thought indeed for an insecure god. <br>
<a href="../contra/gods.html">How many gods are there?</a>
<p>Although God told Adam not to eat from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil (<a href="2.html#16">2:16-17</a>), he 
never told him not to eat from the Tree of Life. God said that Adam would die the day that he ate from the forbidden 
tree (<a href="2.html#17">2:17</a>). Well, Adam ate from that tree (<a href="3.html#6">3:6</a>), so why was God worried that 
Adam might eat from that other tree (the Tree of Life) and live forever?
