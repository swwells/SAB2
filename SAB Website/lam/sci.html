<p><li>Ostriches are not cruel and inattentive parents, as this verse implies. They are, in fact, careful and 
attentive parents. The male scoops out a hollow for the eggs, which are incubated by the female during the day 
and the male at night. After the eggs are hatched, they are 
cared for by the mother for over a month, at which time the chicks can keep up with running adults. <a href="4.html#3">4:3</a>
