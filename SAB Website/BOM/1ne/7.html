<img src="../../images/sex1.gif" > (7:1-2) God tells Lehi to send his sons back to Jerusalem to get 
some women.
<!--
Remember how Nephi and his brothers had to return to Jerusalem to get the brass plates? Well, now they have go back again to get some 
women. Otherwise they'd have to have sex with their mom in order to populate the New World, and that's just too yucky for Mormons to even 
think about. (It was OK for Adam's family back in the day, but not for Mormon Israelites in 600 BCE.)

<p>So after Lehi made an end of prophesying about his seed, God stopped by to chat for a while. God said that he couldn't help but 
notice that Lehi didn't bring any women along with him, and God didn't think it was meet for Lehi not to have some daughters to 
give to his sons. What were they going to do, God asked, fuck their own mother? (I'm paraphrasing here.)
-->
<p>(7:1) <i>"After my father, Lehi, had made an end of prophesying concerning his seed, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto him again, 
saying that it was not meet for him, Lehi, that he should take his family into the wilderness alone; but that his sons should take 
daughters to wife, that they might raise up seed unto the Lord in the land of promise."</i>
<!--
<p>(7:2) So God commanded Lehi to send his four sons back to Jerusalem (again!) to get Ishmael and his family. That way Nephi's 
sons would could have sex with Ishmael's daughters instead of their mom.
-->
<p>(7:2) <i>"And it came to pass that the Lord commanded him that I, Nephi, and my brethren, should again return unto the land of Jerusalem, 
and bring down Ishmael and his family into the wilderness."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (7:3-15)

<p>(7:3) So Lehi's sons went back to Jerusalem one more time.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did again, with my brethren, go forth into the wilderness to go up to Jerusalem."</i>

<p>(7:5) It was just another quick, uneventful, 400+ km trip. After they arrived, the Lord softened up Ishmael's heart enough so that he 
agreed to leave Jerusalem with his family and go into the wilderness so that Lehi's sons could have sex with his daughters.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that the Lord did soften the heart of Ishmael, and also his household, insomuch 
that they took their journey with us down into the wilderness to the tent of our father."</i> 

<p>(7:6) But then deja vu came to pass all over again. Laman and Lemuel revolted, 
along with two of Ishmael's daughters and two of his sons. 

<p><i>"And it came to pass that ... behold Laman and Lemuel, and two of the daughters of Ishmael, and the 
two sons of Ishmael and their families, did rebel against us."</i>

<p>(7:8-15) And then Nephi gave a speech that no one should ever have to read or listen to. 

<p><i>"And now I, Nephi ... spake unto them, saying, yea,  ... 
blah blah blah ... for thus the Spirit of the Lord constraineth me that I should speak."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif" border="0" > (7:8)
being grieved for the hardness of their hearts
 <a href="../../mk/3.html#5">Mark 3:5</a> 

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (7:16) After listening to Nephi's awful speech, Nephi's brothers were exceedingly wroth. 
So they tied him up and left him for the animals to eat. 

<p><i>"And it came to pass that when I, Nephi, had spoken these words ... they were exceedingly wroth, and they did bind me with cords, 
for they sought ... to leave me in the wilderness to be devoured by wild beasts."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" border="0" > (7:16) <a href="exceed_list.html">Exceedingly</a> 

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (7:17-22)

<p>(7:17-18) But then Nephi prayed unto the Lord. (His prayers are worse than 
his speeches.) And, just like magic, the cords were untied. 

<p><i>"But it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord, saying: ... blah blah blah ... 
And it came to pass that ... the bands were loosed from off my hands and feet, and I stood before my brethren, and I spake unto them again."</i>

<p>(7:19) Nephi's brothers tried to lay hands on him again but he was saved by a daughter, mother, and brother of Ishmael, who softened the 
hearts of Nephi's younger brothers. 

<p><i>"And it came to pass that they were angry with me again, and sought to lay hands upon me; but behold, one of the daughters of 
Ishmael, yea, and also her mother, and one of the sons of Ishmael, did plead with my brethren, insomuch that they did soften 
their hearts; and they did cease striving to take away my life."</i>

<p>(7:20) Then Nephi's brothers bowed down and begged Nephi to forgive them. 

<p><i>"And it came to pass that they were sorrowful, because of their wickedness, insomuch that they did bow down before me, 
and did plead with me that I would forgive them."</i>

<p> (7:21-22) And it came to pass that Nephi forgave his brothers and they returned to their father's tent in the wilderness, where they killed and sacrificed some animals for 
God and began to get to know the daughters of Ishmael. 

<p><i>"And it came to pass that I did frankly forgive them all that they had done ... And after I and my 
brethren and all the house of Ishmael had come down unto the tent of my father, they did give thanks unto the Lord their God; and they did 
offer sacrifice and burnt offerings unto him."</i>

<tr><td><b><a name="8">7:8</b></a>   <span class="a">And now I, Nephi,</span> <span class="plag">being grieved for the hardness of their 
hearts</span>, therefore I <span class="a">spake unto them, saying, yea,</span> even unto Laman and unto Lemuel: Behold 
ye are mine elder brethren, and how is it that ye are so hard in your hearts, and so blind 
in your minds, that ye have need that I, your younger brother, should speak unto you, yea, 
and set an example for you? 

<tr><td><b><a name="9">7:9</b></a>   How is it that ye have not hearkened unto the word of the 
Lord?

<tr><td><b><a name="10">7:10</b></a>   How is it that ye have forgotten that ye have seen an angel 
of the Lord? 

<tr><td><b><a name="11">7:11</b></a>   Yea, and how is it that ye have forgotten what great things 
the Lord hath done for us, in delivering us out of the hands of Laban, and also that we 
should obtain the record? 

<tr><td><b><a name="12">7:12</b></a>   Yea, and how is it that ye have forgotten that the Lord is 
able to do all things according to his will, for the children of men, if it so be that 
they exercise faith in him?  Wherefore, let us be faithful to him. 

<tr><td><b><a name="13">7:13</b></a>   And if it so be that we are faithful to him, we shall obtain 
the land of promise; and ye shall know at some future period that the word of the Lord 
shall be fulfilled concerning the destruction of Jerusalem; for all things which the Lord 
hath spoken concerning the destruction of Jerusalem must be fulfilled. 

<tr><td><b><a name="14">7:14</b></a>   For behold, the Spirit of the Lord ceaseth soon to strive with 
them; for behold, they have rejected the prophets, and Jeremiah have they cast into 
prison.  And they have sought to take away the life of my father, insomuch that they have 
driven him out of the land. 

<tr><td><b><a name="15">7:15</b></a>   Now behold, I say unto you that if ye will return unto 
Jerusalem ye shall also perish with them.  And now, if ye have choice, go up to the land, 
and remember the words which I speak unto you, that if ye go ye will also perish; <span class="a">for thus 
the Spirit of the Lord constraineth me that I should speak.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="16">7:16</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when I, Nephi, 
had spoken these words unto my brethren, they were angry with me.  <span class="a">And it 
came to pass</span> that they did lay their hands upon me, for behold, they 
were <span class="a">exceedingly</span> wroth, and they did bind me with cords, for they 
sought to take away my life, that they might leave me in the wilderness to be devoured by 
wild beasts. 

<tr><td><b><a name="17">7:17</b></a>   <span class="a">But it came to pass 
that I prayed unto the Lord, saying:</span> O Lord, according to my faith which is in thee, wilt 
thou deliver me from the hands of my brethren; yea, even give me strength that I may burst 
these bands with which I am bound. 

<tr><td><b><a name="18">7:18</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that</span> when I had 
said these words, behold, <span class="a">the bands were loosed from off my hands and feet, and I stood 
before my brethren, and I spake unto them again. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="19">7:19</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they were 
angry with me again, and sought to lay hands upon me; but behold, one of the daughters of 
Ishmael, yea, and also her mother, and one of the sons of Ishmael, did plead with my 
brethren, insomuch that they did soften their hearts; and they did cease striving to take 
away my life. 

<tr><td><b><a name="20">7:20</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that they were 
sorrowful, because of their wickedness, insomuch that they did bow down before me, and 
did plead with me that I would forgive them </span>of the thing that they had done against 
me. 

<tr><td><b><a name="21">7:21</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that I did frankly 
forgive them all that they had done</span>, and I did exhort them that they would pray unto the 
Lord their God for forgiveness.  <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they did 
so.  And after they had done praying unto the Lord we did again travel on our journey 
towards the tent of our father. 

<tr><td><b><a name="22">7:22</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that we did come 
down unto the tent of our father.  <span class="a">And after I and my brethren and all the house of Ishmael 
had come down unto the tent of my father, they did give thanks unto the Lord their God; 
and they did offer sacrifice and burnt offerings unto him.</span>
