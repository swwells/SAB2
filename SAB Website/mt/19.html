(19:10) <i>"It is not good to marry."</i><br>
After Jesus denounces divorce, his disciples say that if divorce isn't allowed, then &quot;it is good not to 
marry.&quot; Jesus agrees by saying that it is better to make yourself a eunuch
"for the kingdom of heaven's sake." He that is able to receive it, let him
receive it.&quot; Many have castrated themselves attempting to follow Jesus'
advice in this verse.<br>

<A href="18.html#8">Mt.18:8-9</A>, <A href="../mk/9.html#43">Mk.9:43-48</A>). It
might make someone castrate himself so that he could be one of the 144,000 male

  <tr><td><B><A name="9">19:9</A></B>
  And I say unto you, <span class="c">Whosoever
    shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall
    marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away
    doth commit adultery.</span>

<tr><td><B><A name="10">19:10</A></B>
  His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, <span class="fv">it
    is not good to marry.</span>

  <tr><td><B><A name="11">19:11</A></B>
  But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to
    whom it is given.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="12">19:12</A></B>
  For <span class="h">there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb</span>:
    and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and <span class="s">there be eunuchs, which
    have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is
    able to receive it, let him receive it.</span>
 
  <tr><td><B><A name="13">19:13</A></B>
  Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his
    hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="14">19:14</A></B>
  But Jesus said, <span class="c">Suffer little children, </span>and forbid them not, <span class="c">to come unto me: for of such is the
    kingdom of heaven.</span>
    
 <tr><td><B><A name="15">19:15</A></B>
  And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.
  
  <tr><td><B><A name="16">19:16</A></B>
  And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, <span class="c">what good thing shall I do,
    that I may have eternal life?</span>

  <tr><td><B><A name="17">19:17</A></B>
  And he said unto him, <span class="c">Why callest thou me good? there is none good but
    one, that is, God</span>: but <span class="c">if
    thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.</span>

  <tr><td><B><A name="18">19:18</A></B>
  <span class="g">He saith unto him, Which?
    Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou
    shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,</span>

  <tr><td><B><A name="19">19:19</A></B>
  <span class="g">Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as

  <tr><td><B><A name="20">19:20</A></B>
  The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth
    up: what lack I yet?
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="21">19:21</A></B>
  Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast,
    and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and
    follow me.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="22">19:22</A></B>
  But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he
    had great possessions.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="23">19:23</A></B>
  Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, <span class="c">That a rich man
    shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.</span>
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="24">19:24</A></B>
  And again I say unto you, <span class="i">It is easier for a camel to go through the eye
    of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span>
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="25">19:25</A></B>
  When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who
    then can be saved?
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="26">19:26</A></B>
  But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible;
    but <span class="c">with God all things
    are possible.</span>
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="27">19:27</A></B>
  Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and
    followed thee; what shall we have therefore?
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="28">19:28</A></B>
  And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That <span class="a">ye which have

    of his glory, ye also <span class="a">shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

  <tr><td><B><A name="29">19:29</A></B>
  And <span class="f">every one that
    hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or
