"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",

"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",

gave these commandments unto his children; and I would that ye should remember that the Lord God ordained priests, after 
his holy order, which was after the order of his Son, to teach these things unto the people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>13:2</b>   And those priests were ordained after the order of his Son, in a manner that thereby the 
people might know in what manner to look forward to his Son for redemption. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>13:3</b>   And this is the manner after which they were ordained -- being called and prepared from 
the foundation of the world according to the foreknowledge of God, on account of their <span class="a">exceeding</span> faith and good works; 
in the first place being left to choose good or evil; therefore they having chosen good, and exercising 
<span class="a">exceedingly</span> great faith, are called with a holy calling, yea, with that holy calling which was 
prepared with, and according to, a preparatory redemption for such. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32"> <a href="exceed_list.html">Exceedingly</a> [13:3(2), 12]
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>13:4</b>   And thus they have been called to this holy calling on account of their faith, while 
others would reject the Spirit of God on account of the hardness of their hearts and blindness of their minds, while, 
if it had not been for this they might have had as great privilege as their brethren. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>13:5</b>   Or in fine, in the first place they were on the same standing with their brethren; thus 
this holy calling being prepared from the foundation of the world for such as would not harden their hearts, being in 
and through the atonement of the Only Begotten Son, who was prepared --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>13:6</b>   And thus being called by this holy calling, and ordained unto the high priesthood of 
the holy order of God, to teach his commandments unto the children of men, that they also might enter into his 
rest --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>13:7</b>   This high priesthood being after the order of his Son, which order was from the 
foundation of the world; or in other words, being without beginning of days or end of years, being prepared from 
eternity to all eternity, according to his foreknowledge of all things --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>13:8</b>   Now they were ordained after this manner -- being called with a holy calling, and ordained 
with a holy ordinance, and taking upon them the high priesthood of the holy order, which calling, and ordinance, and 
high priesthood, is without beginning or end --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>13:9</b>   Thus they become high <span class="plag">priests forever, after the order of the 
Son</span>, <span class="plag">the Only Begotten of 
the Father</span>, who is without beginning of days or end of years, who is <span class="plag">full of grace</span>, 
equity, <span class="plag">and truth.</span>   And thus 
it is.  Amen. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. -- <a href="../../heb/5.html#6">Hebrews 5:6</a>
<p>Full of grace and truth -- <a href="../../jn/1.html#14">John 1:14</a>
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>13:10</b>   Now, as I said concerning the holy order, or this high priesthood, there were many 
who were ordained and became high priests of God; and it was on account of their exceeding faith and repentance, 
and their righteousness before God, they choosing to repent and work righteousness rather than to perish; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>13:11</b>   Therefore they were called after this holy order, and were sanctified, and 
<span class="plag">their garments were washed white through the blood of the Lamb.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

</font>
  
<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>13:12</b>   Now they, after being sanctified by the Holy Ghost, having their garments made white, 
being pure and spotless before God, could not look upon sin save it were with abhorrence; and there were 
many, <span class="a">exceedingly</span> great many, who were made pure and entered into the rest of the Lord their 
God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>13:13</b>   And now, my brethren, I would that ye should humble yourselves before God, and 
<span class="plag">bring forth fruit meet for repentance</span>, that ye may also enter into that rest. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/plag.gif" border="0" width="32" height="32">
 Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance.  -- <a href="../../mt/3.html#8">Matthew 3:8</a>
 </font>

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>13:14</b>   Yea, humble yourselves even as the people in the days of Melchizedek, who was also a high 
priest after this same order which I have spoken, who also took upon him the high priesthood forever. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>13:15</b>   And it was this same <span class="plag">Melchizedek to whom Abraham paid tithes</span>; 
yea, even our father Abraham 
paid tithes of one-tenth part of all he possessed. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

For this Melchisedec ... To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all. -- <a href="../../heb/7.html#1">Hebrews 7:1-2</a>
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>13:16</b>   Now these ordinances were given after this manner, that thereby the people might look 
forward on the Son of God, it being a type of his order, or it being his order, and this that they might look forward 
to him for a remission of their sins, that they might enter into the rest of the Lord. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>13:17</b>   Now this Melchizedek was a king over the land of Salem; and his people had waxed strong 
in iniquity and abomination; yea, they had all gone astray; they were full of all manner of wickedness; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>13:18</b>   But Melchizedek having exercised mighty faith, and received the office of the high 
priesthood according to the holy order of God, did preach repentance unto his people.  And behold, they did repent; and 
Melchizedek did establish peace in the land in his days; therefore he was called the prince of peace, for he was the 
king of Salem; and he did reign under his father. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>13:19</b>   Now, there were many before him, and also there were many afterwards, but none were 
greater; therefore, of him they have more particularly made mention. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>13:20</b>   Now I need not rehearse the matter; what I have said may suffice.  Behold, 
the scriptures are before you; <span class="plag">if ye will wrest them it shall be to your own destruction.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

these glad tidings declared unto us in all parts of our vineyard. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>13:24</b>   For behold, angels are declaring it unto many at this time in our land; and this is for 
the purpose of preparing the hearts of the children of men to receive his word at the time of his coming in his

which was according to the spirit of prophecy which was in them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>13:27</b>   And now, my brethren, I wish from the inmost part of my heart, yea, with great anxiety

repentance; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
