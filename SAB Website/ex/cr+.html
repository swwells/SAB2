<p><li>God threatens to kill the Pharaoh's firstborn son.  <a href="4.html#23">4:23</a>

<p><li>God decides to kill Moses because his son had not yet been circumcised.  
<a href="4.html#24">4:24-26</a>

<p><li>After God has sufficiently hardened the Pharaoh's heart, he kills all the firstborn Egyptian children. When he was finished
"there was not a house where there was not one dead." Finally, he runs out of little babies to kill, so he slaughters the firstborn
cattle, too. <a href="12.html#29">12:29</a>

<p><li>After hardening Pharaoh's heart a few more times, God drowns Pharaoh's army in the sea  
<a href="14.html#4">14:4-28</a>

<p><li>"The Lord is a man of war." Indeed, judging from his acts in the Old Testament, he is a vicious warlike monster. 
 <a href="15.html#3">15:3</a>
 
<p><li>If you do what God says, he won't send his diseases on you (like he did to the Egyptians). 
But otherwise.... <a href="15.html#26">15:26</a>

<p><li>Joshua, with God's approval, kills the Amalekites "with the edge of the sword."  <a href="17.html#13">17:13</a>

<p><li>"The Lord has sworn [God swears!] that the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation." 
 <a href="17.html#14">17:14-16</a>
 
<p><li>Any person or animal that touches Mt. Sinai shall be stoned to death or "shot through."  <a href="19.html#12">19:12-13</a>

<p><li>Like the great and powerful Wizard of Oz, nobody can see God and live. <a href="19.html#21">19:21</a>

<p><li>God gives instructions for killing and burning animals. He says that if we will make such "burnt offerings," he will bless
us for it. What kind of mind would be pleased by the killing and burning of innocent animals?  <a href="20.html#24">20:24</a>

<p><li>A child who hits or curses his parents must be executed.  <a href="21.html#15">21:15, 17</a>

<p><li>"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live." Thousands of innocent women have suffered excruciating deaths because of this
verse.  <a href="22.html#18">22:18</a>

<p><li>"Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death." Is it really necessary to kill such people? Couldn't we just
send them to counseling or something? <a href="22.html#19">22:19</a>

<p><li>"He who sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the Lord only, he shall be utterly destroyed." If this commandment is obeyed,
then the four billion people who do not believe in the biblical god must be killed.  <a href="22.html#20">22:20</a>

<p><li>If you make God angry enough, he will kill you and your family with his own sword.  <a href="22.html#24">22:24</a>

<p><li>God promises to "send his fear before the Israelites" and 
to kill everyone that they encounter when they enter the promised land. 
<a href="23.html#27">23:27</a>

<p><li>Get some animals, kill them, chop up their bodies, wave body parts in the air, burn the carcasses, and sprinkle the
blood all around -- in precisely the way God tells you. It may well make you sick, but it makes God feel good.
 <a href="29.html#11">29:11-37</a>
 
<p><li>Those who break the Sabbath are to be executed. <a href="31.html#14">31:14</a>

<p><li>God orders the sons of Levi (Moses, Aaron, and the other members of their tribe that were "on the Lord's side") to kill
"every man his neighbor." "And there fell of the people that day about 3000 men." <a href="32.html#27">32:27-28</a>

<p><li>But God wasn't satisfied with the slaughter of the 3000, so he killed some more people with a plague. 
 <a href="32.html#35">32:35</a>
 
<p><li>Whoever works, or even kindles a fire, on the Sabbath "shall be put to death." <a href="35.html#2">35:2-3</a>
