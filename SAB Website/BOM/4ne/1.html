<tr><td ><b><a name="25"></a>1:25</b>   And from that time forth they did have their goods and their substance no more common among them. 
  <td bgcolor="eeeeee" >

<tr><td ><b><a name="26"></a>1:26</b>   And they began to be divided into classes; and they began to build up churches unto themselves to get 
gain, and began to deny the true church of Christ. 
  <td bgcolor="eeeeee" >

<tr><td ><b><a name="27"></a>1:27</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when two hundred and ten years had passed away there were many churches in 
the land; yea, there were many churches which professed to know the Christ, and yet they did deny the more parts of his 
gospel, insomuch that they did receive all manner of wickedness, and did administer that which was sacred unto him to 
whom it had been forbidden because of unworthiness. 
  <td bgcolor="eeeeee" >

<tr><td ><b><a name="28"></a>1:28</b>   And this church did multiply 
  <span class="a">exceedingly</span> because of iniquity, and because of the power of Satan who 
did get hold upon their hearts. <td bgcolor="eeeeee" >

<tr><td ><b><a name="29"></a>1:29</b>   And again, there was another church which denied the Christ; and they did persecute the true church of 
Christ, because of their humility and their belief in Christ; and they did despise them because of the many miracles 
which were wrought among them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee" >

<tr><td ><b><a name="30"></a>1:30</b>   Therefore they did exercise power and authority over the disciples of Jesus who did tarry with them, 
and they did cast them into prison; but by the power of the word of God, which was in them, the prisons were 
  <span class="plag">rent in 
twain</span>, and they went forth doing mighty miracles among them.

people of Jesus did not smite again.  And thus <span class="i">they did dwindle in unbelief</span> and wickedness, from year to year, even

did wilfully rebel against the gospel of Christ; and they did teach their children that they should not believe, even

of Nephi from the beginning. <td bgcolor="eeeeee" >

<tr><td ><b><a name="40"></a>1:40</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that two hundred and forty and four years had passed away, and thus were the

<tr><td ><b><a name="41"></a>1:41</b>   And they did still continue to build up churches unto themselves, and adorn them with all manner of 
precious things.   And thus did two hundred and fifty years pass away, and also two hundred and sixty years. 
  <td bgcolor="eeeeee" >

<tr><td ><b><a name="44"></a>1:44</b>   And from this time the disciples began to sorrow for the sins of the world.

there were none that were righteous save it were the disciples of Jesus.  And gold and silver did they lay up in 
store in abundance, and did traffic in all manner of traffic.

year from the coming of Christ. <td bgcolor="eeeeee" >
