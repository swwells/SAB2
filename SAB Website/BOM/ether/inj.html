(Those who disbelieve in the Book of Mormon will go to hell.) <a href="4.html#8">4:8</a>

<p><li>"He that believeth not shall be damned." <a href="4.html#18">4:18</a>

<p><li>To punish the people for "their wicked combinations," God sent wars, famines, and pestilences. The resulting 
 destruction was the greatest ever seen on the face of the earth -- greater than the flood of Noah, the 
 destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, or World War II.  Yet there is no evidence 
	for any of this today. <a href="11.html#7">11:7</a>
