<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>1:22</b>   <span class="a">It came to pass</span> that from this time forth there began to be lyings sent 
forth among the people, by Satan, to harden their hearts, to the intent that they might not believe in those 
signs and wonders which they had seen; but notwithstanding these lyings and deceivings the more part of the 
people did believe, and were converted unto the Lord. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

others, baptizing unto repentance, in the which there was a great remission of sins.  And thus the people began 
again to have peace in the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>1:24</b>   And there were no contentions, save it were a few that began to preach, endeavoring to prove 
by the scriptures that it was no more expedient to observe the law of Moses.  Now in this thing they did err, 
having not understood the scriptures. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

 must be fulfilled in every whit; yea, the word came unto them that it must be fulfilled; yea, <span class="c">that one 
 jot or tittle should not pass away till it should all be fulfilled;</span> therefore in this same year were they 
 brought to a knowledge of their error and did confess their faults.

 save it were for the Gadianton robbers, who dwelt upon the mountains, who did infest the land; for so strong 
 were their holds and their secret places that the people could not overpower them; therefore they did commit
  many murders, and did do much slaughter among the people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

  <tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>1:29</b>   And there was also a cause of much sorrow among the Lamanites; for behold, they had many children

  were Zoramites, by their lyings and their flattering words, to join those Gadianton robbers. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>
