  <p><li>"The god of this world" (Satan?) has blinded the minds of nonbelievers. <a href="4.html#3">4:3-4</a>
  
  <p><li>"Walk by faith, not by sight." (Don't look where you're going.) <a href="5.html#7">5:7</a>
  
  <p><li> "The terror of the Lord" <a href="5.html#11">5:11</a>
  
  <p><LI>Jesus, who was without sin, was made into sin. This made the real sinners sinless. <A href="5.html#21" >5:21</A>

The televangelist's favorite verse! <a href="9.html#7">9:7</a>

  <p><li>There were these guys that Paul once knew, but he just can't remember whether it was in or out of the body. It was sort of an out of body experience. Anyway, 
  one of these guys was way up in the third heaven and the other guy was in paradise. He heard stuff, too, but it's illegal to talk about it. <a href="12.html#2">12:2-4</a>
  
  <p><li> Paul says he "will not spare" when he comes back to punish those who have sinned. <a href="13.html#2">13:2</a>
  
  <p><li>Are you a reprobate? Here's the test: if you know for sure that Jesus is in you, you're not a reprobate. Otherwise you are. <a href="13.html#5">13:5</a>
  
  <p><li>"Greet one another with an holy kiss." <a href="13.html#12">13:12</a>
