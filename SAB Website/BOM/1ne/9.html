<p>(9:1) Nephi left out a lot of shit his dad said in the valley of Lemuel. 
He just didn't have room for it on his plates.

<p><i>"And all these things did my father see, and hear, and speak, as he dwelt in a tent, in the valley of Lemuel. And also a great 
many more things, which cannot be written upon these plates."</i>

<p>(9:2) <i>"The plates ... I have given the name of Nephi; 
wherefore, they are called the plates of Nephi, after mine own name; and these plates also are called the plates 
of Nephi."</i>

<p>Okay, I guess we'll call them the plates of Nephi.

<p>(9:4) God told Nephi to make two sets of plates: one for "for the more part of the ministry" 
and the other set "for the more part of the reign of the kings and the wars and contentions."

<p><i>"These plates are for the more part of the ministry; and the other plates are for the more part of the reign of the kings 
and the wars and contentions of my people."</i>

<p>(9:5) God told Nephi to make both sets of plates "for a wise purpose." But Nephi had no idea what that purpose was.

<p><i>"The Lord hath commanded me to make these plates for 
a wise purpose in him, which purpose I know not."</i>

<p>(9:6) And thus it is and so on and so forth. Amen.

<p><i>"And thus it is. Amen."</i>
