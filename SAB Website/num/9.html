    When the tabernacle was set up, it was covered by a cloud during the day and by fire all night.
    
    <p>God led the Israelites from one camp to the other with a cloud. When the cloud stopped and rested someplace, the Israelites pitched their 
    tents. When the cloud started moving again, the Israelites followed it.   
 
<p>(9:15) <i>"On the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the
    tabernacle ... and at even there was upon
    the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning."</i>
    
    <p>(9:16) <i>"So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night."</i>
       
<p>(9:17) <i>"And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the
    children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there
    the children of Israel pitched their tents."</i>
    
    <p>(9:18) <i>"At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment 
    of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents."</i>

    <p>(9:19) <i>"And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel 
    kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not."</i>

    <p>(9:20) <i>"And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment 
    of the LORD they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed."</i>

    <p>(9:21) <i>"And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and that the cloud was taken 
    up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed."</i>

    <p>(9:22) <i>"Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, 
    remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed."</i>
