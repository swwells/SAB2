And Nephi is quite proud of what he's written; it suffices him, since he has spoken plainly according to the plainness of his prophesying. 
For his soul delights in plainness.

<p>(31:1) <i>"And now I, Nephi, make an end of my prophesying."</i>

I cannot write but a few things, which I know must surely come to pass; neither can I write but a few of the words of 
my brother Jacob. 

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>31:2</b>   Wherefore, <span class="a">the things which I have written sufficeth me</span>, save it be a few words which I must speak

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>31:4</b>   Wherefore, I would that ye should remember that I have spoken unto you concerning that prophet which

water, and have received the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost, and <span class="plag">can speak with a new tongue</span>, yea, even <span class="plag">with the
