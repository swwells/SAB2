Alif. Lam. Mim. Ra. These are verses of the Scripture. That which is  revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the Truth, but most of mankind believe not. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Allah it is Who raised up the heavens without visible supports, then mounted  the Throne, and 
compelled <span class="sci">the sun</span> and the moon to be 
of service, each <span class="sci">runneth unto  an appointed term;</span> He ordereth the course; He detaileth the revelations, that haply ye  may 
be certain of the meeting with your Lord. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/sci1.gif"> (13:2) <i>"The sun ... runneth unto  an appointed term."</i><br>
The sun (according to the Quran) orbits the earth.

And <span class="sci">He</span> it is Who <span class="sci">spread out the earth</span> and placed therein firm hills and  flowing streams, 
and of all fruits He placed therein two spouses (male and female).  He covereth the night with the day. Lo! herein verily are portents for 
people who take  thought. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">

Sounds like a flat earth to me.

And in the Earth are neighbouring tracts, vineyards and ploughed lands, and  date-palms, like and unlike, which are watered with one water. And we have made  some of them to excel others in fruit. Lo! herein verily are portents for people who  have sense. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Allah knoweth that which every female beareth and that which the wombs  absorb and that which they grow. And everything with Him is measured. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

He is the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible, the Great, the High  Exalted. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

For him are angels ranged before him and behind him, who guard him by  Allah's command. Lo! Allah changeth not the condition of a folk until they (first)  change that which is in their hearts; and if Allah willeth misfortune for a folk there is  none that can repel it, nor have they a defender beside Him. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

He it is Who showeth you the lightning, a fear and a hope, and raiseth the  heavy clouds. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

The thunder hymneth His praise and (so do) the angels for awe of Him. He  launcheth the thunderbolts and smiteth with them whom He will while they dispute  (in doubt) concerning Allah, and He is mighty in wrath. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b>13:<a NAME="14">14</b></a>
Unto Him is the real prayer. Those unto whom they pray beside Allah  respond to them not 
at all, save as (is the response to) one who stretcheth forth his  hands toward water

Everyone and everything (and their shadow) bows to Allah twice a day (whether they want to or not).

Say (O Muhammad): Who is Lord of the heavens and the earth ? Say: Allah.  Say: Take ye then (others) beside Him for protectors, 
which, even for themselves,  have neither benefit nor hurt ? Say: Is the blind man equal to the seer, or is darkness  equal to light ? 
Or assign they unto Allah partners who created the like of His creation  so that the creation (which they made and His creation) seemed 
alike to them ? Say:  Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Almighty. 

<tr><td><b>13:<a NAME="17">17</b></a>
He sendeth down water from the sky, so that valleys flow according to their  measure, and the flood beareth (on its surface) swelling foam - from that which they  smelt in the fire in order to make ornaments and tools riseth a foam like unto it - thus  Allah coineth (the similitude of) the true and the false. Then, as for the foam, it  passeth away as scum upon the banks, while, as for that which is of use to mankind, it  remaineth in the earth. Thus Allah coineth the similitudes. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Had it been possible for a Lecture to cause the mountains to move, or the  earth to be torn asunder, or the dead to speak, (this Qur'an would have done so). Nay,  but Allah's is the whole command. Do not those who believe know that, had Allah  willed, He could have guided all mankind ? As for those who disbelieve, disaster  ceaseth not to strike them because of what they do, or it dwelleth near their home  until the threat of Allah come to pass. Lo!
