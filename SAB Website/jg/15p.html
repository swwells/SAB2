 <img src="../images/interp.gif"> (15:1) After <a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2009/11/gods-51st-killing-samsons-riddle-and.html">the spirit of the Lord 
 came upon Samson and he murdered 30 men for their clothes</a>, he went to his wife's house for some sex. He even 
 brought a young goat along to pay for her services. [The New Oxford Annotated Bible says that a young goat was "the usual gift for sexual intercourse." 
 (<a href="../gen/38.html#17">Gen.38:17</a>) OK, that may have been true for prostitutes, but did you have to give your wife a goat every time you had sex?]
 
<p>(15:1a) <i>"Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber."</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif">
 <img src="../images/wom1.gif"> 
 <img src="../images/fv.gif"> (15:1b-2) Then Samson's father-in-law had to tell him the bad news: he had given Samson's wife to one of his 
Philistine friends because he thought Samson "hated" her. 
 He suggested that Samson take his younger daughter instead, saying the younger one's prettier anyway. 

<p>(15:1b) <i>"But her father would not suffer him to go in."</i>
 
 <p>(15:2) <i>"And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: 
 is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her."</i>

<p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif">
    <IMG src="../images/inj1.gif">
    <IMG src="../images/cr1.gif"> (15:4-5) But Samson didn't want his wife's little sister. He wanted his wife back, because as you'll recall 
from <a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2009/11/gods-51st-killing-samsons-riddle-and.html">God's last killing</a>, "She pleased Samson well."

So Samson had an idea, an idea that only one of God's special heroes could come up with. He'd catch 300 foxes, tie their tails together, light them on 
fire, and set them loose in the Philistine's grain fields. 

<p>(15:4) <b> <i>"Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails."</i></b>

</b>

<p>(15:5) <b> <i>"And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go</b> into the standing corn of the Philistines."</i>

</b>

<p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif"> (15:6) But it didn't work out as planned. After the burning foxes destroyed the fields, the 
Philistines didn't 
give Samson his wife back; they burned her 
and her father to death. 

<p>(15:6) <i>"Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson ... 
because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire."</i>

<p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif">
    <IMG src="../images/inj1.gif">
    <IMG src="../images/cr1.gif"> (15:7-8) In response, Samson smote the 
Philistines "hip and thigh" wit a great slaughter. (I'm not including this killing on God's list, since the Bible 
doesn't tell us that "the Spirit of the Lord cam upon him" or otherwise imply that God was involved.)

<p>(15:7) <i>"Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease."</i>

<p>(15:8) <i>"And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter."</i>

<p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif">
    <IMG src="../images/cr1.gif"> (15:11-16) <b><a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2009/11/gods-52nd-killing-samson-kills-1000.html">The Spirit of the Lord 
    came upon Samson and he killed 1000 men with the jawbone of an ass.</a></b> <br>
    Then 3000 men of Judah came, tied him up, and took him to the Philistines. When they delivered Samson "the Spirit of the Lord came upon him" and he broke the ropes 
    and killed 1000 men with the jawbone of an ass.<br>
<a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2009/11/gods-52nd-killing-samson-kills-1000.html">God's 54th Killing</a>   

<p>(15:11-12) <i>"Three thousand men of Judah ... said to Samson ... We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines."</i>

<p>(15:13) <i>"And they bound him with two new cords."</i>

<p>(15:14) <b><i>"The spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him,"</i></b>

<p>(15:15) <b><i>"And he found a new jawbone of an ass and slew a thousand men therewith."</i></b>

<p>(15:16) <i>"And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men."</i>

<p> <img src="../images/abs1.gif" >(15:17-19) After Samson killed 1000 men with the jawbone of an ass, he was thirsty. So God 
    created and filled a hollow in the very same jawbone and put water in it for Samson to drink.
    
    <p>(15:17) <i>"When he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand."</i>
    
    <p>(15:18) <i>"And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD,"</i>
    
<p>(15:19) <i>"God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water thereout."</i><br>
