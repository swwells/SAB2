<i>"And he </i>[Noah]</i> <i>laid a tax of one fifth part of all they possessed."</i><br>
Since Zeniff was a bad guy (who "did not keep the commandments of the Lord") and he taxed the people 20%, I guess God (or Joseph Smith) didn't 
approve of flat taxes -- or maybe taxes of any kind.

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" >(11:3)
<i>"And a fifth part of their ziff"</i><br>
Oh no! Zeniff made the people give up a fifth of the ziff! Now <i>that</i> would be hard to live with.<br>

their stead, such as were lifted up in the pride of their hearts. 

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>11:6</b>   Yea, and thus they were supported in their laziness, and in their idolatry, and in their whoredoms,

support iniquity. 

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>11:7</b>   Yea, and they also became idolatrous, because they were deceived by the vain and flattering words of

Why is there no evidence for these fancy buildings? There were many of them, decorated with gold and silver. Where are they now? 
And the metallurgy technology for iron and brass didn't exist prior to European contact. But there was plenty of ziff around at the time so that 
wouldn't have been a problem.
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>11:9</b>   And he also built him a spacious palace, and a throne in the midst thereof, all of which was of fine 
wood and was ornamented with gold and silver and with precious things. 

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>11:10</b>   And he also caused that his workmen should work all manner of fine work within the walls of the 
temple, of fine wood, and of copper, and of brass. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>11:11</b>   And the seats which were set apart for the high priests, which were above all the other seats, he 
did ornament with pure gold; and he caused a breastwork to be built before them, that they might rest their bodies 
and their arms upon while they should speak lying and vain words to his people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>11:12</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that he built a tower near the temple; yea, a very high 
tower, even so high that he could stand upon the top thereof and overlook the land of Shilom, and also the land of 
Shemlon, which was possessed by the Lamanites; and he could even look over all the land round about. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>11:13</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that he caused many buildings to be built in the land 
Shilom; and he caused a great tower to be built on the hill north of the land Shilom, which had been a resort for the 
children of Nephi at the time they fled out of the land; and thus he did do with the riches which he obtained by the 
taxation of his people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

harlots. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>11:15</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that he planted vineyards round about in the land; and 
he built wine-presses, and made wine in abundance; and therefore he became a wine-bibber, and also his people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>11:16</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Lamanites began to come in upon his people, 
upon small numbers, and to slay them in their fields, and while they were tending their flocks. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>11:17</b>   And king Noah sent guards round about the land to keep them off; but he did not send a sufficient 
number, and the Lamanites came upon them and killed them, and drove many of their flocks out of the land; thus the 
Lamanites began to destroy them, and to exercise their hatred upon them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>11:18</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that king Noah sent his armies against them, and they 
were driven back, or they drove them back for a time; therefore, they returned rejoicing in their spoil. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

boast in their own strength, saying that their fifty could stand against thousands of the Lamanites; and thus they 
did boast, and did delight in blood, and the shedding of the blood of their brethren, and this because of the 
wickedness of their king and priests. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>11:20</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that there was a man among them whose name was Abinadi;

me, saying, Go forth, and say unto this people, thus saith the Lord -- Wo be unto this people, for I have seen their 
abominations, and their wickedness, and their whoredoms; and except they repent I will visit them in mine anger. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>11:21</b>   And except they repent and turn to the Lord their God, behold, I will deliver them into the hands of

enemies. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>11:22</b>   And <span class="a">it shall come to pass</span> that they shall know that I am the Lord their God, and am a jealous God, 
visiting the iniquities of my people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>11:23</b>   And <span class="a">it shall come to pass</span> that except this people repent 
and turn unto the Lord their God, they shall be brought into bondage; and none shall deliver them, except it be the 
Lord the Almighty God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>11:24</b>   Yea, and <span class="a">it shall come to pass</span> that when they shall cry unto me I will be slow to hear their cries; 
yea, and I will suffer them that they be smitten by their enemies. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>11:25</b>   And except they repent in sackcloth and ashes, and cry mightily to the Lord their God, I will not hear 
their prayers, neither will I deliver them out of their afflictions; and thus saith the Lord, and thus hath he commanded 
me. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>11:26</b>   Now <span class="a">it came to pass</span> that when Abinadi had spoken these words unto them they were wroth with him, and 
sought to take away his life; but the Lord delivered him out of their hands. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>11:27</b>   Now when king Noah had heard of the words which Abinadi had spoken unto the people, he was also wroth;
 and he said: Who is Abinadi, that I and my people should be judged of him, or who is the Lord, that shall bring upon my
  people such great affliction? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  
 <tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>11:28</b>   I command you to bring Abinadi hither, that I may slay him, for he has said these things that he 
 might stir up my people to anger one with another, and to raise contentions among my people; therefore I will slay 
 him. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>11:29</b>   Now the eyes of the people were blinded; therefore they hardened their hearts against the words of 
 Abinadi, and they sought from that time forward to take him.  And king Noah hardened his heart against the word of 
 the Lord, and he did not repent of his evil doings. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
