 will do since it's a minor offense.) <a href="5.html#6">5:6</a>

<p><li>"She shall be unclean."<br>

<p><li>"If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days ... And she shall then

threescore and six days."<br>

<p><li>"She shall bring a lamb ... for a burnt offering, and... a young pigeon, or dove, for a sin offering."<br>

for her before the LORD for the issue of her uncleanness." <a href="15.html#29">15:29-30</a>

<p><li>"This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed goeth from him ... And of her that is sick of her flowers,

stoned to death. <a href="20.html#27">20:27</a>

    broken, or cut."<br>
God wants us to kill lots of animals for him. Not just any animals, though. God only wants dead, male animals without any blemishes. Don't 
kill any blind , broken, maimed, or scabbed, or female animials for him. <a href="22.html#19">22:19-24</a>

<p><li>God defines the value of human life in dollars and cents. Of course, to God, females
are worth considerably less than males (50 - 60%) -- but neither are worth much.
