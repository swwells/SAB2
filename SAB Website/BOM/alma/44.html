"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",
"<span class='i'>Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever.</span>--<a href='3.html#14'>Alma 3:14</a>",
"<span class='i'>I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</span>--<a href='3.html#15'>Alma 3:15</a>",
"<span class='I'>If ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd ... the devil is your shepherd.</span>--<a href='5.html#39'>Alma 5:39</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",
"<span class='a'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges ... even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year....</span>--<a href='16.html#1'>Alma 16:1</a>",
"<span class='a'>Their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.</span>--<a href='16.html#11'>Alma 16:11</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",
"<span class='v'>He [Ammon] smote off their arms with his sword; for he did withstand their blows by smiting their arms with the edge of his sword.</span>--<a href='17.html#37'>Alma 17:37</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.   Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</span>--<a href='30.html#22'>Alma 30:22</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",
"<span class='i'>God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.</span>--<a href='30.html#47'>Alma 30:47</a>",
"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Amalekites were of a more wicked and murderous disposition than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='43.html#6'>Alma 43:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lord is with us; and ye behold that he has delivered you into our hands.</span>--<a href='44.html#3'>Alma 44:3</a>",
"<span class='i'>God ... has strengthened  our arms that we have gained power over you, by  our faith, by our religion, and by our rites of worship, and by  our church.</span>--<a href='44.html#5'>Alma 44:5</a>",
"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",
"<span class='i'>These dissenters ... became ... more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='47.html#36'>Alma 47:36</a>",
"<span class='a'>God would prosper them in the land, or in other words ... God ... would prosper them in the land.</span>--<a href='48.html#15'>Alma 48:15</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='50.html#22'>Alma 50:22</a>",
"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",
"<span class='i'>The remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty.</span>--<a href='51.html#20'>Alma 51:20</a>",
"<span class='g'>And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye.</span>--<a href='54.html#21'>Alma 54:21</a>",
"<span class='v'>We did slay upwards of two thousand of them after they had surrendered themselves prisoners of war.</span>--<a href='57.html#14'>Alma 57:14</a>",

 up <span class="sci">his sword and his cimeter</span> nd, and his bow into the hands of Moroni, and said unto him: Behold, here are our weapons 
 of war; we will deliver them up unto you, but we will not suffer ourselves to take an oath unto you, which we know 
 that we shall break, and also our children; but take our weapons of war, and suffer that we may depart into the

 breastplates and your shields that have preserved you. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>44:10</b>   And now when Zerahemnah had made an end of speaking these words, Moroni returned the sword and 
 the weapons of war, which he had received, unto Zerahemnah, saying: Behold, we will end the conflict. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>44:11</b>   Now I cannot recall the words which I have spoken, therefore as the Lord liveth, ye shall not 
 depart except ye depart with an oath that ye will not return again against us to war.  Now as ye are in our 
 hands we will spill your blood upon the ground, or ye shall submit to the conditions which I have proposed. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>44:12</b>   And now when Moroni had said these words, Zerahemnah retained his sword, and he was angry with 
 Moroni, and he rushed forward that he might slay Moroni; but as he raised his sword, behold, one of Moroni's 
 soldiers smote it even to the earth, and it broke by the hilt; and 
	<span class="v">he also smote Zerahemnah that he took off 
 his scalp and it fell to the earth.  </span>And Zerahemnah withdrew from before them into the midst of his soldiers. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

	<span class="v">the soldier who stood by, who smote off the scalp

 stretched it forth unto them, saying unto them with a loud voice: </span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

 <tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>44:15</b>   Now there were many, <span class="v">when they heard these words and saw the scalp which was upon the 
 sword, that were struck with fear</span>; and many came forth and threw down their weapons of war at the feet of Moroni, and entered into a covenant of peace.  And as many as entered into a covenant they suffered to 
 depart into the wilderness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>44:16</b>   <span class="a">Now it came to pass</span> that Zerahemnah was <span class="a">exceedingly</span> wroth, and he did

 of Moroni had prophesied. 

 <tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>44:19</b>   Now Zerahemnah, when he saw that they were all about to be destroyed, cried mightily unto Moroni, 
 promising that he would covenant and also his people with them, if they would spare the remainder of their lives, 
 that they never would come to war again against them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

 <tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>44:21</b>   Now the number of their dead was not numbered because of the greatness of the number; yea, the
