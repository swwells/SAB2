<p><li>"And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger 
son had done unto him."<br>
What did Ham do? Did he just look at his naked father or was there something more to it than that? 
  Some commentators have suggested that Ham committed homosexual rape on his drunken father, and that 
  this was why Ham's descendants were eternally punished with slavery. <a href="9.html#24">9:24</a>
  
<p><li>This verse doesn't say what the Sodomites did to make them such exceedingly 
great sinners, though most bible believers equate "Sodomite" with homosexual. (But 
see <a href="../ezek/16.html#49">Ezekiel 16:49</a>, which claims the sins of Sodom were pride, 
gluttony, sloth, greed, and failure to help the poor.)  <a href="13.html#13">13:13</a>

<p><li>The two angels that visit Lot wash their feet, eat, and are sexually irresistible to Sodomites. <a href="19.html#1">19:1-5</a>

<p><li>God kills everyone in Sodom and Gomorrah. This was because, so say the
Christian Right, some homosexuals lived there (See <a href="19.html#4">19:4-5</a>). <a href="19.html#24">19:24-25</a>

<p><li>"And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking."<br>
What did Sarah see that disturbed her so much? 

<p>Jonathan Kirsch suggests in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345418824/skepticsannotate/002-4273875-1081639">The 
Harlot by the Side of the Road</a> that the "play" between Isaac and Ishmael may have been of a 
sexual nature, noting that the same word is used to describe the behaviour of 
Ishmael and Isaac as is used in <a href="26.html#8">26:8</a> to describe Isaac's fondling of Rebekah.  <a href="21.html#9">21:9</a>
