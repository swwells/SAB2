the founder of it."

<p><li><a href="../1ne/13.html#26">1 Nephi 13:26-27</a> "A great and 
abominable church, which is most abominable above all other churches; for behold, they 
have taken away from the gospel of the Lamb many parts which are plain and most precious; 
and also many covenants of the Lord have they taken away. And all this have they done that they might 
pervert the right ways of the Lord, that they might blind the eyes and harden the hearts of the 
children of men."

<p><li><a href="../1ne/13.html#28">1 Nephi 13:28</a> "After the book hath gone forth 
through the hands of the great and abominable church, that there are many plain and 
precious things taken away from the book."

<p><li><a href="../1ne/13.html#32">1 Nephi 13:32</a> "The plain and most precious parts of the gospel of the 
Lamb which have been kept back by that abominable church."

<p><li><a href="../1ne/14.html#3">1 Nephi 14:3</a> "That great and 
abominable church, which was founded by the devil and his children, that he might lead 
away the souls of men down to hell."

<p><li><a href="../1ne/14.html#9">1 Nephi 14:9</a> "That great and abominable church, which is the 
mother of abominations, whose founder is the devil."

church."

<p><li><a href="../1ne/14.html#17">1 Nephi 14:17</a> "The wrath of God is poured out upon the 
mother of harlots, which is the great and abominable church of all the earth, whose 
founder is the devil."

<p><li><a href="../1ne/22.html#13">1 Nephi 22:13</a> "And the blood of that great and abominable church, which is the whore of all the earth, shall turn 
upon their own heads; for they shall war among themselves, and the sword of their own hands shall fall upon their own 
heads, and they shall be drunken with their own blood." 

<p><li><a href="../1ne/22.html#14">1 Nephi 22:14</a> "that great whore, who hath perverted the right ways of the Lord, yea, that 
great and abominable church, shall tumble to the dust and great shall be the fall of it."
