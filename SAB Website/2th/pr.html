<p><li>The day of Christ is at hand?<br>
    If Paul wrote this letter (and many scholars think he didn't, then he is changing his mind 
    (since writing 1 Thessalonians)about the timing of the Christ's return. The day of the Lord is no longer at hand. In fact it's 
    nowhere near. Many things     must happen first: there will be a great "falling away", a "man of sin" will be reveled, and Satan 
    will show off his power by doing all kinds of signs and wonders. <a href="2.html#2">2:2-9</a>
