<i>"A land ... choice above all other lands ... preserved for a righteous people"</i><br> 
God likes America best. He made it for a righteous people (the Mormons), and America will face God's wrath if it fails to please him 
(and them).

when the fulness of his wrath should come upon them. </span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>2:9</b>   And now, we can behold the decrees of God concerning this land, that it is 
  <span class="int">a land of promise; and 
whatsoever nation shall possess it shall serve God, or they shall be swept off when the fulness of his wrath shall 
come upon them. </span>And the fulness of his wrath cometh upon them when they are ripened in iniquity. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>2:10</b>   For behold, this is <span class="int">a land which is choice above all other lands; wherefore he that doth possess it 
shall serve God or shall be swept off</span>; for it is the everlasting decree of God.  And it is not until the fulness of 
iniquity among the children of the land, that they are swept off. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>2:11</b>   And this cometh unto you, O ye Gentiles, that ye may know the decrees of God -- that ye may repent, and 
not continue in your iniquities until the fulness come, that ye may not bring down the fulness of the wrath of God upon 
you as the inhabitants of the land have hitherto done. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>2:12</b>   Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall be free from bondage,

Jesus Christ, who hath been manifested by the things which we have written. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>2:13</b>   And now I proceed with my record; for 
  <span class="a">behold, it came to pass </span>that the Lord did bring Jared and his 
brethren forth even to that great sea which divideth the lands.  And as they came to the sea they pitched their tents; 
and they called the name of the place Moriancumer; and they dwelt in tents, and dwelt in tents upon the seashore for 
the space of four years. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>2:14</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> at the end of four years that

Jared</span>, and chastened him because he remembered not to call upon the name of the Lord. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

for his brethren who were with him.  And the Lord said unto him: I will forgive thee and thy brethren of their sins; 
but thou shalt not sin any more, for ye shall remember that my Spirit will not always strive with man; wherefore, if 
ye will sin until ye are fully ripe ye shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.  And these are my thoughts upon 
  <span class="a">the land which I shall give you for your inheritance; for it shall be a land choice above all other lands.

The Jaredites are plunged into "the depths of the sea", but they survive using a magic light that Jesus gives 
them.
