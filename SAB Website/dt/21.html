If you see a pretty woman among the captives and would like her for a wife, then just bring her home and "go in
unto her." Later, if you decide you don't like her, you can "let her go."

When someone commits "a sin worthy of death" that person is "accursed of God" and should be hung on a tree. But should the accursed person be killed first by stoning and 
<i>then</i> hung on a tree or be killed <i>by hanging</i> on a tree -- that is, by crucifixion? 
<a href="http://www.theologynetwork.org/biblical-studies/going-on/the-messiah-who-was-cursed-on-the-tree.htm">I'll leave that for the Bible scholars to decide.</a> 
The important thing is to make sure you take the accursed dead body down before nightfall. Leaving dead bodies on trees all night is just nasty. Too nasty even for a 
very nasty God.

<p>(21:22) <i>"<b>If a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou
    hang him on a tree</b>: His body shall not remain all night upon the tree:"</i>
    
<p>(22:23) <i>"His body shall not remain all night upon the tree ... (for he that is hanged is accursed of God)."</i>
