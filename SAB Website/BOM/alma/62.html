"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",
"<span class='i'>Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever.</span>--<a href='3.html#14'>Alma 3:14</a>",
"<span class='i'>I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</span>--<a href='3.html#15'>Alma 3:15</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",
"<span class='a'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges ... even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year....</span>--<a href='16.html#1'>Alma 16:1</a>",
"<span class='a'>Their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.</span>--<a href='16.html#11'>Alma 16:11</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",
"<span class='v'>He [Ammon] smote off their arms with his sword; for he did withstand their blows by smiting their arms with the edge of his sword.</span>--<a href='17.html#37'>Alma 17:37</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.   Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</span>--<a href='30.html#22'>Alma 30:22</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",
"<span class='i'>God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.</span>--<a href='30.html#47'>Alma 30:47</a>",
"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Amalekites were of a more wicked and murderous disposition than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='43.html#6'>Alma 43:6</a>",

"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",
"<span class='i'>These dissenters ... became ... more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='47.html#36'>Alma 47:36</a>",
"<span class='a'>God would prosper them in the land, or in other words ... God ... would prosper them in the land.</span>--<a href='48.html#15'>Alma 48:15</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='50.html#22'>Alma 50:22</a>",
"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",
"<span class='i'>The remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty.</span>--<a href='51.html#20'>Alma 51:20</a>",
"<span class='g'>And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye.</span>--<a href='54.html#21'>Alma 54:21</a>",
"<span class='v'>We did slay upwards of two thousand of them after they had surrendered themselves prisoners of war.</span>--<a href='57.html#14'>Alma 57:14</a>",

courage, and was filled with <span class="a">exceedingly</span> great joy because of the faithfulness 
of Pahoran, that he was not also a traitor to the freedom and cause of his country. <td bgcolor="eeeeee" rowspan="2">

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>62:2</b>   But he did also mourn <span class="a">exceedingly</span> because of the iniquity of those 
who had driven Pahoran from the judgment-seat, yea, in fine because of those who had rebelled against their 
country and also their God. 

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>62:3</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Moroni took a small number of men, according 
to the desire of Pahoran, and gave Lehi and Teancum command over the 
remainder of his army, and took his march towards the land of Gideon. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>62:4</b>   And he did raise the standard of liberty in whatsoever place he did enter, and gained 
whatsoever force he could in all his march towards the land of Gideon. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>62:5</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that thousands did flock unto his standard, and did 
take up their swords in the defence of their freedom, that they might not come into bondage. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>62:6</b>   And thus, when Moroni had gathered together whatsoever men he could in all his march, he came to 
the land of Gideon; and uniting his forces with those of Pahoran they became <span class="a">exceedingly</span> 
strong, even stronger than the men of Pachus, who was the king of those dissenters who had driven the freemen 
out of the land of Zarahemla and had taken possession of the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>62:7</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Moroni and Pahoran went down with their 
armies into the land of Zarahemla, and went forth against the city, and did meet the men of Pachus, 
insomuch that they did come to battle. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>62:8</b>   And behold, Pachus was slain and his men were taken prisoners, and Pahoran was restored 
to his judgment-seat. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>62:9</b>   And the men of Pachus received their trial, according to the law, and also 
<span class="i">those king-men 
who had been taken and cast into prison; and they were executed according to the law</span>; yea, those men of 
Pachus and <span class="i">those king-men, whosoever would not take up arms in the defence of their country</span>, but would 
fight against it, were put to death. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>62:11</b>   And thus ended the thirtieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi; Moroni 
and Pahoran having restored peace to the land of Zarahemla, among their own people, <span class="i">having inflicted death 
upon all those who were not true to the cause of freedom.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>62:12</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> in the commencement of the thirty and first year of 
the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, Moroni immediately caused that provisions should be sent, and 
also an army of six thousand men should be sent unto Helaman, to assist him in preserving that part of the 
land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>62:13</b>   And he also caused that an army of six thousand men, with a sufficient quantity of food, 
should be sent to the armies of Lehi and Teancum.  <span class="a">And it 
came to pass</span> that this was done to fortify the land against the Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>62:14</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Moroni and Pahoran, leaving a large body of 
men in the land of Zarahemla, took their march with a large body of men towards the land of Nephihah, being 
determined to overthrow the Lamanites in that city. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>62:15</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that 
	<span class="v">as they were marching towards the land, 
they took a large body of men of the Lamanites, and slew many of them,</span> and took their provisions and their 
weapons of war. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>62:16</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> after they had taken them, they caused them to 
enter into a covenant that they would no more take up their weapons of war against the Nephites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>62:17</b>   And when they had entered into this covenant they sent them to dwell with the people of 
Ammon, and they were in number about four thousand who had not been slain. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>62:18</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when they had sent them away they pursued 
their march towards the land of Nephihah.  <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when they had c
ome to the city of Nephihah, they did pitch their tents in the plains of Nephihah, which is near the city of 
Nephihah. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>62:19</b>   Now Moroni was desirous that the Lamanites should come out to battle against them, upon 
the plains; but the Lamanites, knowing of their <span class="a">exceedingly</span> great courage, and 
beholding the greatness of their numbers, therefore they durst not come out against them; therefore they 
did not come to battle in that day. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>62:20</b>   And when the night came, Moroni went forth in the darkness of the night, and came upon 
the top of the wall to spy out in what part of the city the Lamanites did camp with their army. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>62:21</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they were on the east, by the entrance; 
and they were all asleep.  And now Moroni returned to his army, and caused that they should prepare in 
haste strong cords and ladders, to be let down from the top of the wall into the inner part of the wall. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>62:22</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Moroni caused that his men should march forth 
and come upon the top of the wall, and let themselves down into that part of the city, yea, even on the west, 
where the Lamanites did not camp with their armies. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>62:23</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they were all let down into the city by 
night, by the means of their strong cords and their ladders; thus when the morning came they were all within 
the walls of the city. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>62:24</b>   And now, when the Lamanites awoke and saw that the armies of Moroni were within the walls, 
they were affrighted <span class="a">exceedingly</span>, insomuch that they did flee out by the pass. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>62:25</b>   And now <span class="v">when Moroni saw that they were fleeing before him, he did cause that his men should 
march forth against them, and slew many</span>, and surrounded many others, and took them prisoners; and the remainder 
of them fled into the land of Moroni, which was in the borders by the seashore. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>62:26</b>   Thus had Moroni and Pahoran obtained the possession of the city of Nephihah without the loss of 
one soul; and <span class="v">there were many of the Lamanites who were slain.
	</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
	
<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>62:27</b>   <span class="a">Now it came to pass</span> that many of the Lamanites that were prisoners were desirous to join the 
people of Ammon and become a free people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>62:28</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that as many as were desirous, unto them it was 
granted according to their desires. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>62:29</b>   Therefore, all the prisoners of the Lamanites did join the people of Ammon, and did begin 
to labor <span class="a">exceedingly</span>, tilling the ground, raising all manner of grain, and flocks 
and herds of every kind; and thus were the Nephites relieved from a great burden; yea, insomuch that they 
were relieved from all the prisoners of the Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>62:30</b>   <span class="a">Now it came to pass</span> that Moroni, after he had obtained possession of the city of 
Nephihah, having taken many prisoners, which did reduce the armies of the 
Lamanites <span class="a">exceedingly</span>, and having regained many of the Nephites who had been 
taken prisoners, which did strengthen the army of Moroni <span class="a">exceedingly</span>; therefore 
Moroni went forth from the land of Nephihah to the land of Lehi. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>62:31</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when the Lamanites saw that Moroni was coming 
against them, they were again frightened and fled before the army of Moroni. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="32"></a>62:32</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Moroni and his army did pursue them from 
city to city, until they were met by Lehi and Teancum; and the Lamanites 
fled from Lehi and Teancum, even down upon the borders by the seashore, 
until they came to the land of Moroni. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="33"></a>62:33</b>   And the armies of the Lamanites were all gathered together, insomuch that they were 
all in one body in the land of Moroni.    Now, Ammoron, the king of the Lamanites, was also with them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="34"></a>62:34</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Moroni and Lehi and 
Teancum did encamp with their armies round about in the borders of the land of Moroni, insomuch that the Lamanites 
were encircled about in the borders by the wilderness on the south, and in the borders by the wilderness on the 
east. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">


<tr><td><b><a name="35"></a>62:35</b>   And thus they did encamp for the night.  For behold, the Nephites and the Lamanites also 
were weary because of the greatness of the march; therefore they did not resolve upon any stratagem in the 
night-time, save it were Teancum; for he was <span class="a">exceedingly</span> angry with Ammoron, 
insomuch that he considered that Ammoron, and Amalickiah his brother, had been the cause of this great 
and lasting war between them and the Lamanites, which had been the cause of so much war and bloodshed, 
yea, and so much famine. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="36"></a>62:36</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that <span class="v">Teancum in his anger did go forth into the 
camp of the Lamanites</span>, and did let himself down over the walls of the city.  And he went forth with a cord, 
from place to place, insomuch that he did find the king; and he did <span class="v">cast a javelin at him, which did pierce 
him near the heart.</span>  But behold, the king did awaken his servants before he died, insomuch that they did 
pursue Teancum, and slew him. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/cr1.gif" width="32" height="32"><br>
<font size="-1">Teancum sneaks into the Lamanite's camp and throws a javelin into the king's heart.
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="37"></a>62:37</b>   <span class="a">Now it came to pass</span> that when Lehi and Moroni knew that 
Teancum was dead they were <span class="a">exceedingly</span> sorrowful; for behold, he had been a man who 
had fought valiantly for his country, yea, a true friend to liberty; and he had suffered very 
many <span class="a">exceedingly</span> sore afflictions.  But behold, he was dead, and had gone the way 
of all the earth. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="38"></a>62:38</b>   <span class="a">Now it came to pass</span> that <span class="v">Moroni marched forth on the 
morrow, and came upon the Lamanites, insomuch that they did slay them with a great slaughter</span>; and they did drive them out of the land; and they 
did flee, even that they did not return at that time against the Nephites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">Moroni and the Nephites slay the Lamanites "with a great slaughter."
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="39"></a>62:39</b>   And thus ended the thirty and first year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi; 
and thus they had had wars, and bloodsheds, and famine, and affliction, for the space of many years. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="40"></a>62:40</b>   And there had been murders, and contentions, and dissensions, and all manner of iniquity among 
the people of Nephi; nevertheless for the righteous' sake, yea, because of the prayers of the righteous, they 
were spared. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="41"></a>62:41</b>   But behold, because of the <span class="a">exceedingly</span> great length of the war 
between the Nephites and the Lamanites many had become hardened, because of 
the <span class="a">exceedingly</span> great length of the war; and many were softened because of 
their afflictions, insomuch that they did humble themselves before God, even in the depth of humility. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="42"></a>62:42</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that after Moroni had fortified those parts of 
the land which were most exposed to the Lamanites, until they were sufficiently strong, he returned to the 
city of Zarahemla; and also Helaman returned to the place of his inheritance; and there was once more peace 
established among the people of Nephi. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="43"></a>62:43</b>   And Moroni yielded up the command of his armies into the hands of his son, whose name 
was Moronihah; and he retired to his own house that he might spend the remainder of his days in peace. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="44"></a>62:44</b>   And Pahoran did return to his judgment-seat; and Helaman did take upon him again to preach 
unto the people the word of God; for because of so many wars and contentions it had become expedient that a 
regulation should be made again in the church. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="45"></a>62:45</b>   Therefore, Helaman and his brethren went forth, and did declare the word of God with 
much power unto the convincing of many people of their wickedness, which did cause them to repent of 
their sins and to be baptized unto the Lord their God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="46"></a>62:46</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they did establish again the church 
of God, throughout all the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="47"></a>62:47</b>   Yea, and regulations were made concerning the law.  And their judges, and their 
chief judges were chosen. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">


<tr><td><b><a name="48"></a>62:48</b>   And the people of Nephi began to prosper again in the land, and began to multiply and 
to wax <span class="a">exceedingly</span> strong again in the land.  And they began to 
grow <span class="a">exceedingly</span> rich. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="49"></a>62:49</b>   But notwithstanding their riches, or their strength, or their prosperity, they were not 
lifted up in the pride of their eyes; neither were they slow to remember the Lord their God; but they did 
humble themselves <span class="a">exceedingly</span> before him. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="50"></a>62:50</b>   Yea, they did remember how great things the Lord had done for them, that he had delivered 
them from death, and from bonds, and from prisons, and from all manner of afflictions and he had delivered 
them out of the hands of their enemies. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="51"></a>62:51</b>   And they did pray unto the Lord their God continually, insomuch that the Lord did bless 
them, according to his word, so that they did wax strong and prosper in the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="52"></a>62:52</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that all these things were done.  And Helaman died, 
in the thirty and fifth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
