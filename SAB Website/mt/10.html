<i>"Fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell."</i>  Notice that Jesus makes a clear distinction between 
the soul and the body in this verse. Why would he do that if, as 
the Governing Body of the Jehovah's Witnesses teaches, the soul <i>is</i> the body?<br>

painful deaths of starvation, predation, or disease. But don't worry. God will do the same for you. (He thinks that humans 
are worth much more than sparrows.)

<p>(10:29) <i>"Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father."</i>

<img src="../images/interp.gif" > (10:34-37) Jesus warns us not to love our parents or
children too much. We have to make sure that we always love him more than our family. Jehovah's Witnesses use 
these verses to justify forcing members to disfellowship (shun) 
their own family.

<p>(10:34) <i>"Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword."</i>
