<td bgcolor="eeeeee" rowspan="11">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/cr1.gif"> (14.1) <i>"Judith said to all the people: Hear me, my brethren, hang ye up this head upon our walls."</i> <br>
Judith tells the Israelites to hang Holofernes' head up on the wall.

<p><img src="../../images/cr1.gif">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (14:4-5) Judith tells the Israelite army that the Assyrian captains will freak out when the see the 
headless Holofernes wallowing about in his own blood. That's when, she says, the Israelites should attack, knowing that God will kill 
the Assyrians for them.

<p>(14:4) <i>"When the captains of them shall run to the tent of Holofernes, and shall find 
him without his head wallowing in his blood, fear shall fall upon them."</i>

<p>(14:5) <i>"When you shall know that they are fleeing, go after them securely, for the 
Lord will destroy them under your feet."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif">
<img src="../../images/sex1.gif"> (14:6) <i>"Then Achior seeing the power that the God of Israel had wrought, leaving the 
religion of the gentiles, he believed God, and circumcised the flesh of his foreskin, and was joined to the people of Israel, 
with all the succession of his kindred until this present day."</i><br>When Achior (the leader of the Ammonites)
 saw what God had done (helped Judith cut off a drunken man's head) he immediately converted to Judaism and cut off his own foreskin.
 
<p><img src="../../images/cr1.gif">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (14:7)  <i>"At break of day, they hung up the head of Holofernes upon the walls,
 and every man took his arms, and they sent out with a great noise and shouting."</i><br>
 So the Israelites hang Holofernes head on the wall, gathered their weapons, and set out "with a great noise and shouting."
