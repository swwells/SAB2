"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",
"<span class='i'>Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever.</span>--<a href='3.html#14'>Alma 3:14</a>",
"<span class='i'>I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</span>--<a href='3.html#15'>Alma 3:15</a>",
"<span class='I'>If ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd ... the devil is your shepherd.</span>--<a href='5.html#39'>Alma 5:39</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",
"<span class='a'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges ... even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year....</span>--<a href='16.html#1'>Alma 16:1</a>",
"<span class='a'>Their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.</span>--<a href='16.html#11'>Alma 16:11</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",
"<span class='v'>He [Ammon] smote off their arms with his sword; for he did withstand their blows by smiting their arms with the edge of his sword.</span>--<a href='17.html#37'>Alma 17:37</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.   Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</span>--<a href='30.html#22'>Alma 30:22</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",
"<span class='i'>God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.</span>--<a href='30.html#47'>Alma 30:47</a>",
"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Amalekites were of a more wicked and murderous disposition than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='43.html#6'>Alma 43:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lord is with us; and ye behold that he has delivered you into our hands.</span>--<a href='44.html#3'>Alma 44:3</a>",
"<span class='i'>God ... has strengthened  our arms that we have gained power over you, by  our faith, by our religion, and by our rites of worship, and by  our church.</span>--<a href='44.html#5'>Alma 44:5</a>",
"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",
"<span class='i'>These dissenters ... became ... more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='47.html#36'>Alma 47:36</a>",
"<span class='a'>God would prosper them in the land, or in other words ... God ... would prosper them in the land.</span>--<a href='48.html#15'>Alma 48:15</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='50.html#22'>Alma 50:22</a>",
"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",
"<span class='i'>The remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty.</span>--<a href='51.html#20'>Alma 51:20</a>",
"<span class='g'>And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye.</span>--<a href='54.html#21'>Alma 54:21</a>",
"<span class='v'>We did slay upwards of two thousand of them after they had surrendered themselves prisoners of war.</span>--<a href='57.html#14'>Alma 57:14</a>",

[57:1, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 17, 18, 24, 25, 28, 30, 32, 33(2), 36]
</font>
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>57:2</b>   But I sent an epistle unto the king, that we were sure our forces were sufficient to take 
 the city of Antiparah by our force; and by delivering up the prisoners for that city we should suppose 
 ourselves unwise, and that we would only deliver up our prisoners on exchange. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>57:3</b>   And Ammoron refused mine epistle, for he would not exchange prisoners; therefore we began 
 to make preparations to go against the city of Antiparah. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>57:4</b>   But the people of Antiparah did leave the city, and fled to their other cities, which they 
 had possession of, to fortify them; and thus the city of Antiparah fell into our hands. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>57:5</b>   And thus ended the twenty and eighth year of the reign of the judges. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>57:6</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that in the commencement of the twenty and ninth 
 year, we received a supply of provisions, and also an addition to our army, from the land of Zarahemla, and 
 from the land round about, to the number of six thousand men, besides sixty of the sons of the Ammonites who 
 had come to join their brethren, my little band of two thousand.  And now behold, we were strong, yea, 
 and we had also plenty of provisions brought unto us. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>57:7</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that it was our desire to wage a battle with 
 the army which was placed to protect the city Cumeni. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>57:8</b>   And now behold, I will show unto you that we soon accomplished our desire; yea, with our 
 strong force, or with a part of our strong force, we did surround, by night, the city Cumeni, a little 
 before they were to receive a supply of provisions. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>57:9</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that we did camp round about the city for many 
 nights; but we did sleep upon our swords, and keep guards, that the Lamanites could not come upon us by 
 night and slay us, which they attempted many times; but as many times as they attempted this their blood 
 was spilt. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>57:10</b>   At length their provisions did arrive, and they were about to enter the city by night.  And 
 we, instead of being Lamanites, were Nephites; therefore, we did take them and their provisions. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>57:11</b>   And notwithstanding the Lamanites being cut off from their support after this manner, 
 they were still determined to maintain the city; therefore it became expedient that we should take those 
 provisions and send them to Judea, and our prisoners to the land of Zarahemla. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>57:12</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that not many days had passed away before the 
 Lamanites began to lose all hopes of succor; therefore they yielded up the city unto our hands; and thus 
 we had accomplished our designs in obtaining the city Cumeni. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>57:13</b>   <span class="a">But it came to pass</span> that our prisoners were so numerous that, notwithstanding the enormity 
 of our numbers, we were obliged to employ all our force to keep them, or to put them to death. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>57:14</b>   For behold, they would break out in great numbers, and would fight with stones, and with 
 clubs, or whatsoever thing they could get into their hands, insomuch that <span class="v">we did slay upwards of two 
 thousand of them after they had surrendered themselves prisoners of war.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">The Nephites kill two thousand Lamanites after they had surrenedered as prisoners of war.

 <tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>57:15</b>   Therefore it became expedient for us, that we should put an end to their lives, or guard 
 them, sword in hand, down to the land of Zarahemla; and also our provisions were not any more than 
 sufficient for our own people, notwithstanding that which we had taken from the Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>57:16</b>   And now, in those critical circumstances, it became a very serious matter to determine 
 concerning these prisoners of war; nevertheless, we did resolve to send them down to the land of 
 Zarahemla; therefore we selected a part of our men, and gave them charge over our prisoners to go down 
 to the land of Zarahemla. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>57:17</b>   <span class="a">But it came to pass</span> that on the morrow they did return.  And now behold, we did not 
 inquire of them concerning the prisoners; for behold, the Lamanites were upon us, and they returned in 
 season to save us from falling into their hands.  For behold, Ammoron had sent to their support a new 
 supply of provisions and also a numerous army of men. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>57:18</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that those men whom we sent with the 
 prisoners did arrive in season to check them, as they were about to overpower us. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>57:19</b>   But behold, my little band of two thousand and sixty fought most desperately; yea, they 
 were firm before the Lamanites, and did administer death unto all those who opposed them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>57:20</b>   And as the remainder of our army were about to give way before the Lamanites, behold, 
 those two thousand and sixty were firm and undaunted. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>57:21</b>   Yea, and they did obey and observe to perform every word of command with exactness; 
 yea, and even according to their faith it was done unto them; and I did remember the words which they 
 said unto me that their mothers had taught them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>57:22</b>   And now behold, it was these my sons, and those men who had been selected to convey 
 the prisoners, to whom we owe this great victory; for it was they who did beat the Lamanites; 
 therefore they were driven back to the city of Manti. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>57:23</b>   And we retained our city Cumeni, and were not all destroyed by the sword; nevertheless, 
 we had suffered great loss. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>57:24</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that after the Lamanites had fled, I immediately 
 gave orders that my men who had been wounded should be taken from among the dead, and caused that their 
 wounds should be dressed. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>57:25</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that there were two hundred, out of my two 
 thousand and sixty, who had fainted because of the loss of blood; nevertheless, according to the 
 goodness of God, and to our great astonishment, and also the joy of our whole army, there was not one 
 soul of them who did perish; yea, and neither was there one soul among them who had not received many wounds. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>57:26</b>   And now, their preservation was astonishing to our whole army, yea, that they should be 
 spared while there was a thousand of our brethren who were slain.  And we do justly ascribe it to the 
 miraculous power of God, because of their <span class="a">exceeding</span> faith in that which they had been taught to believe -- 
 that there was a just God, and whosoever did not doubt, that they should be preserved by his marvelous 
 power. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

 <tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>57:27</b>   Now this was the faith of these of whom I have spoken; they are young, and their minds are 
 firm, and they do put their trust in God continually. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>57:28</b>   <span class="a">And now it came to pass</span> that after we had thus taken care of our wounded men, and had buried 
 our dead and also the dead of the Lamanites, who were many, behold, we did inquire of Gid concerning the 
 prisoners whom they had started to go down to the land of Zarahemla with. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>57:29</b>   Now Gid was the chief captain over the band who was appointed to guard them down to 
 the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>57:30</b>   And now, these are the words which Gid said unto me: Behold, we did start to go down to 
 the land of Zarahemla with our prisoners.  <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that we did meet 
 the spies of our armies, who had been sent out to watch the camp of the Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>57:31</b>   And they cried unto us, saying -- Behold, the armies of the Lamanites are marching 
 towards the city of Cumeni; and behold, they will fall upon them, yea, and will destroy our people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="32"></a>57:32</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that our prisoners did hear their cries, which 
 caused them to take courage; and they did rise up in rebellion against us. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="33"></a>57:33</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> because of their rebellion we did cause that 
 our swords should come upon them.  <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they did in a body run 
 upon our swords, in the which, the greater number of them were slain; and the remainder of them broke 
 through and fled from us. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="34"></a>57:34</b>   And behold, when they had fled and we could not overtake them, we took our march with 
 speed towards the city Cumeni; and behold, we did arrive in time that we might assist our brethren in 
 preserving the city. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="35"></a>57:35</b>   And behold, we are again delivered out of the hands of our enemies.  And blessed is the 
 name of our God; for behold, it is he that has delivered us; yea, that has done this great thing for us. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 

 <tr><td><b><a name="36"></a>57:36</b>   <span class="a">Now it came to pass</span> that when I, Helaman, had heard these words of Gid, I was filled with 
 <span class="a">exceeding</span> joy because of the goodness of God in preserving us, that we might not all perish; yea, and I 
 trust that the souls of them who have been slain have entered into the rest of their God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
