That's just your interpretation. <a href="1.html#20">1:20</a>

<p><li>"There shall be false teachers among you, who ... shall bring in damnable heresies ... and bring upon themselves swift destruction ... 
Their damnation slumbereth not." <a href="2.html#1">2:1-3</a>

<p><li>"God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness." <a href="2.html#4">2:4</a>

<p><li>"Noah ... a preacher of righteousness."<br>
God drowned everyone on earth except for Noah [the first drunken "preacher of righteousness" (see <a href="../gen/9.html#20">Gen.9:20-25</a>)] and his family. 
<a href="2.html#5">2:5</a>, <a href="3.html#6">3:6</a>

<p><li>"Turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes" <a href="2.html#6">2:6</a>

<p><li>Lot, who in <A href="../gen/19.html#8">Gen.19:8</A> offers his two virgin daughters to a crowd of angel rapers and 
later gets drunk and impregnates them (<A href="../gen/19.html#30">19:30-38</A>), is a "just" and "righteous man."
<A href="2.html#7"  >2:7-8</A>.

<p><li>God knows how to punish those that lust or "despise government." (Watch out Teabaggers!) <a href="2.html#9">2:9-14</a>
    
    <p><li>The author believes the story in Numbers (<A href="../num/22.html#28">22:28-30</A>)
    about the talking ass. <A href="2.html#16"  >2:16</A>
    
  <p><li>Those who lose their faith are like dogs that eat their own vomit. <A href="2.html#22"  >2:22</A>
    
  <p><li>The author of 2 Peter is aware of the failed expectations of early believers. He knows that Jesus, who was 
  supposed to come soon, didn't come at all. Many have begun to ask, "Where is the promise of his coming?" So he makes up the 
  "one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day." Believers have been using it ever since.  
    <A href="3.html#4">3:4-8</A>
    
    <p><li>God will set the entire earth on fire so that he can burn non-believers to death. <a href="3.html#7">3:7</a>
    
    <p><li>When Jesus finally does come, the heavens will "pass away with a great noise" and the earth will "be burnt up." <a href="3.html#10">3:10</a>
    
  <p><li>Paul's epistles are hard to understand; those who try to understand them, as with the other scriptures, 
  do so "unto their own destruction." <A href="3.html#16"  >3:16</A>
