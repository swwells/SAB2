<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="1">30:1</A></B>
  And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to
    Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at
    Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="2">30:2</A></B>
  For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation
    in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="3">30:3</A></B>
  For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not
    sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered
    themselves together to Jerusalem.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="4">30:4</A></B>
  And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="5">30:5</A></B>
  So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel,
    from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto
    the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done it of a long time
    in such sort as it was written.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="6">30:6</A></B>
  So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes
    throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the
    king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God of
    Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that
    are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="7">30:7</A></B>
  And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed
    against the LORD God of their fathers, who therefore gave them up to
    desolation, as ye see.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="8">30:8</A></B>
  Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves unto
    the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever:
    and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away
    from you.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="9">30:9</A></B>
  For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your children shall
    find compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come
    again into this land: for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and
    will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="10">30:10</A></B>
  So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and
    Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="11">30:11</A></B>
  Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled
    themselves, and came to Jerusalem.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="12">30:12</A></B>
  Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the
    commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="13">30:13</A></B>
  And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of
    unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="14">30:14</A></B>
  And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all
    the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="15">30:15</A></B>
  Then <span class="v">they killed the passover</span> on the fourteenth day of the second month:

  <tr><td><B><A name="18">30:18</A></B>
  For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and Manasseh,
    Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the
    passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them,
    saying, The good LORD pardon every one<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="19">30:19</A></B>
  That prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though

  And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="21">30:21</A></B>
  And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast
    of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the
    priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments unto the
    LORD.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="22">30:22</A></B>
  And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good
    knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days,
    offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their
    fathers.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="23">30:23</A></B>
  And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they
    kept other seven days with gladness.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="24">30:24</A></B>
  For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand
    bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation
    a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests
    sanctified themselves.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and
    all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came
    out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="26">30:26</A></B>
  So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son
    of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice
    was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place, even unto
