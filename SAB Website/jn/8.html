  <img src="../images/interp.gif" > (7:53 - 8:11) <i>The woman caught in adultery</i><br>
  This is one of the best-known and most-loved of all Bible stories, but it shouldn't be in the Bible. 
  For although some manuscripts put it 
  here, others after John 7:36, 21:35, or Luke 21:38,&nbsp; it is not 
  found anywhere in the oldest and best manuscripts.

    came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.

  And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery;
    and when they had set her in the midst,
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="4">8:4</A></B>
  They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very

<img src="../images/interp.gif" > (8:7) <i>"He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her."</i><br>
Jesus tells those who'd like to stone to death
an adulteress that whoever among them that is without sin should &quot;cast the
first stone.&quot; Good advice -- but it directly contradicts the teachings of
the Old Testament (<A href="../lev/20.html#10">Lev.20:10</A>). If that wasn't a
good law then, why did God make it? Has he since changed his mind? If so, shouldn't it
then be removed (along with most of the OT) from the bible?<br>

<img src="../images/interp.gif" > (8:58) <i>"Before Abraham was, I am."</i><br>
By saying "before Abraham was, I am," Jesus claims to be God. 
<a href="../contra/Jesus_God.html">Was he?</a><br>
<p>Of course, the Watchtower tries to change the meaning of Jesus' 
words by having him say, "Before Abraham came into existence I have been." I suppose this is 
supposed to mean that he was around as the Archangel Michael back then or something.
(The NWT translates "ego eimi" as "I am" everywhere it 
occurs except in this verse.)
