<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>10:2</b>   And I set guards round about the land, that the Lamanites might not come upon us again unawares and 
destroy us; and thus I did guard my people and my flocks, and keep them from falling into the hands of our enemies. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>10:3</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that we did inherit the land of our fathers for many years, 
yea, for the space of twenty and two years. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>10:5</b>   And I did cause that the women should spin, and toil, and work, and work all manner of fine linen, yea,

continual peace in the land for the space of twenty and two years. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>10:6</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that king Laman died, and his son began to reign in his

and to come up to battle against my people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>10:7</b>   But I had sent my spies out round about the land of Shemlon, that I might discover their preparations, 
that I might guard against them, that they might not come upon my people and destroy them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

be hid in the wilderness; and I also caused that all my old men that could bear arms, and also all my young men that were 
able to bear arms, should gather themselves together to go to battle against the Lamanites; and I did place them in their 
ranks, every man according to his age. 

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>10:10</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that we did go up to battle against the Lamanites; and I, 
even I, in my old age, did go up to battle against the Lamanites.  <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that we 
did go up in the strength of the Lord to battle. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>10:11</b>   Now, the Lamanites knew nothing concerning the Lord, nor the strength of the Lord, therefore they 
depended upon their own strength.  Yet they were a strong people, as to the strength of men. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>10:12</b>   <span class="i">They were a wild, and ferocious, and a blood-thirsty people</span>, 
believing in the tradition of their fathers, which is this -- Believing that they were driven out of the land of 
Jerusalem because of the iniquities of their fathers, and that they were wronged in the wilderness by their brethren, and 
they were also wronged while crossing the sea; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/int.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1">The Lamanites were a wild, ferocious, and blood-thirsty people. <br>

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>10:13</b>   And again, that they were wronged while in the land of their first inheritance, after they had 
crossed the sea, and all this because that Nephi was more faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord -- therefore 
he was favored of the Lord, for the Lord heard his prayers and answered them, and he took the lead of their journey in 
the wilderness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>10:14</b>   And his brethren were wroth with him because they understood not the dealings of the Lord; they were 
also wroth with him upon the waters because they hardened their hearts against the Lord. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>10:15</b>   And again, they were wroth with him when they had arrived in the promised land, because they said 
that he had taken the ruling of the people out of their hands; and they sought to kill him. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>10:16</b>   And again, they were wroth with him because he departed into the wilderness as the Lord had commanded 
him, and took the records which were engraven on the plates of brass, for they said that he robbed them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>10:17</b>   And thus they have <span class="i">taught their children that they should hate them, and that they should murder them, 
and that they should rob and plunder them, and do all they could to destroy them; therefore they have an eternal hatred 
towards the children of Nephi.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/int.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1">The Lamanites taught their children to hate the Nephites, and to rob and kill them whenever they could. <br>

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>10:18</b>   For this very cause has king Laman, by his cunning, and lying craftiness, and his fair promises, 
deceived me, that I have brought this my people up into this land, that they may destroy them; yea, and we have 
suffered these many years in the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>10:19</b>   And now I, Zeniff, after having told all these things unto my people concerning the Lamanites, I did 
stimulate them to go to battle with their might, putting their trust in the Lord; therefore, we did contend with them, 
face to face. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>10:20</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that <span class="i">we did drive them again out of our land; and we slew 
them with a great slaughter, even so many that we did not number them.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
