<p><li>Atheists have dark and foolish hearts. <a href="1.html#21">1:21</a>

<p><li>The existence and nature of God are self-evident; thus, unbelievers are "without
excuse." <a href="1.html#20">1:20</a>

<p><li>God abandons those who don't know him to "uncleanness and vile affections." 
<a href="1.html#24">1:24, 26</a>

<p><li>"God gave them over to a reprobate mind." <a href="1.html#28">1:28</a>

<p><li>With his usual intolerance, Paul condemns homosexuals (including lesbians). This is the only clear reference to
lesbians in the Bible. <a href="1.html#26">1:26-28</a>

<p><li> Homosexuals (those "without natural affection") and their supporters (those "that have pleasure in them") are
"worthy of death."  <a href="1.html#31">1:31-32</a>

<p><li>Paul asks the very good question: "Is there unrighteousness who taketh vengeance [upon innocent people]?" The
obvious answer to this is, yes. Paul then quickly adds, "I speak as a man." What else could he speak as? A donkey or a
god, perhaps? <a href="3.html#5">3:5</a>

<p><li>Paul says that those who accuse him of lying deserve damnation. <a href="3.html#8">3:8</a>

<p><li>The guilty are "justified" and "saved from wrath" by the blood of an innocent victim.
 <a href="5.html#9">5:9</a>
 
  <p><li>"If ... we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son", then God is truly a monster. <a href="5.html#10">5:10</a>
 
<p><li>God punishes everyone for someone else's sin; then he saves them by killing an innocent victim.
 <a href="5.html#12">5:12</a>
 
 <p><li>"By the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation." <a href="5.html#18">5:18</a>
 
 <p><li>"For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the
    obedience of one shall many be made righteous."<br>
    It's difficult to imagine a more unjust system. <a href="5.html#19">5:19</a>

<p><li>God gave the law so "that the offence might abound."  <a href="5.html#20">5:20</a>

<p><li>Everyone is predestined by God to be either saved or damned; they can do nothing to affect their final 
destiny. <a href="8.html#29">8:29-30</a>

<p><li>No one can oppose Christians since God is on their side. <a href="8.html#31">8:31</a>

<p><li>"He that spareth not his own son" shouldn't be trusted by anyone. <a href="8.html#32">8:32</a>

<p><li>A Christian cannot be accused of any wrongdoing. <a href="8.html#33">8:33</a>

<p><li>God makes some people that are destined to go to heaven and others that will go to hell. There is nothing that they
can do to change the will of God. Paul says that this is how it should be, saying: "What if God, willing to show his wrath,
and to make his power known" damns most of mankind to eternal torments of hell for things they either didn't do or
couldn't avoid doing? <a href="9.html#11">9:11-22</a>

<p><li>"Esau have I hated." <a href="9.html#13">9:13</a>

<p><li>"What shall be say then? Is their unrighteousness with God?" It sure looks like it!
 <a href="9.html#14">9:14-22</a>
 
 <p><li>"Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth."
 <a href="9.html#18">9:18</a>
 
 <p><li>God arbitrarily saves a few Jews. <a href="11.html#1">11:1-5</a>
 
<p><li>God blinded the Jews so they wouldn't recognize Jesus as the Messiah. <a href="11.html#7">11:7-10</a>, <a href="11.html#25">25</a>

<p><li>"Salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them [the Jews] to jealousy." <a href="11.html#11">11:11</a>

<p><li>"As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, 
they are beloved for the father's sakes."<br>
Jews are enemies to Christians, but God loves them  for their ancestors' sake. <a href="11.html#28">11:28</a>

<p><li>Gentiles used to be unbelievers, but now the Jews are the unbelievers and God saves gentiles through Jewish unbelief. It's all a part of 
God's plan. <a href="11.html#30">11:30</a>

<p><li> Non-believing Jews will obtain mercy through the mercy of believers. <a href="11.html#31">11:31</a>

<p><li>"The powers that be are ordained of God." Whoever resists them will be damned.
 <a href="13.html#1">13:1-4</a>
 
<p><li>"He that doubteth is damned ... Whosoever is not of faith is sin." <a href="14.html#23">14:23</a>

<p><li>Shun those who disagree with your religious views. <a href="16.html#17">16:17</a>
