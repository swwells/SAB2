        <DD>And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou
          lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for
          a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.

        <p><DT><A href="../ex/22.html#29">Exodus 22:29</A>
        <DD>Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, and of
          thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.

        <p><DT><A href="../lev/27.html#2">Leviticus 27:28-29</A>
        <DD>No devoted thing, that a man
          shall devote unto the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast
          ... shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto
          the LORD. None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be
          redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.

         <p><DT><A href="../jg/11.html#29">Judges 11:29-40</A>
        <DD>Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah.... And Jephthah
          vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail
          deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands, Then it shall be, that
          whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I
          return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the
          LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering. So Jephthah
          passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the
          LORD delivered them into his hands.... And Jephthah came to Mizpeh
          unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with
          timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child.... And it came
          to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my
          daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that
          trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go
          back. And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth
          unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of
          thy mouth.... And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she
          returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which
          he had vowed.

        <DD>Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after
          year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for
          Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.... The
          king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare
          unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the
          daughter of Saul ... And he delivered them into the hands of the
          Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD....And
          after that God was intreated for the land.

          the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the
          priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's
          bones shall be burnt upon thee.
