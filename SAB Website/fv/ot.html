<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../gen/fv.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->
<p><li>Because God liked Abel's animal sacrifice more than Cain's vegetables, Cain kills his brother 
Abel in a fit of religious jealousy. <a href="../gen/4.html#8">4:8</a>

<p><li>Lamech is the first of a long line of biblical men with more than one wife. It seems
that God approves of such marriages. <a href="../gen/4.html#19">4:19</a>

<p><li><i>"Noah ... drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent."</i><br>
The "just and righteous" Noah (6:9, 7:1) plants a vineyard, gets drunk, and lies
around naked in his tent. His son, Ham, happens to see his father in this condition. When Noah
sobers up and hears "what his young son had done unto him" (what did he do besides look at
him?), he curses not Ham, who "saw the nakedness of his father," but Ham's son, Canaan. "A
servant of servants shall he [Canaan] be unto his brethren." 
<a href="../gen/9.html#20">9:20-25</a> 

<p><li>"And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger 
son had done unto him."<br>
What did Ham do? Did he just look at his naked father or was there something more to it than that? 
  Some commentators have suggested that Ham committed homosexual rape on his drunken father, and that 
  this was why Ham's descendants were eternally punished with slavery. <a href="../gen/9.html#24">9:24</a>
  
<p><li>Abram makes his wife lie for him, by telling the Egyptians that she is his sister. But at
least it was half-true, since she was his half-sister. Such incestuous marriages are condemned
elsewhere in the Bible, but god makes an exception for Abram and Sarai. (See 
<a href="../gen/17.html#15">Gen.17:15-16</a>

where God blesses their marriage.) <a href="../gen/12.html#13">12:13</a>
<p><li>Sarai is the first of a long line of barren women who were desperate for children. (In
the Bible, it is the women who are barren, never the men.) She sends Abram into her
handmaid, Hagar, so that she can "obtain children by her." Abram gladly complies. 
<a href="../gen/16.html#1">16:1-4</a>

<p><li>Hagar conceives, making Sarai jealous. Abram tells Sarai to do to Hagar whatever she
wants. "And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled." <a href="../gen/16.html#6">16:6</a>

<p><li>An uncircumcised boy is to be abandoned by his parents and community. <a href="../gen/17.html#14">17:14</a>

<p><li>"I will not destroy it for ten's sake."<br>
    I guess God couldn't find even ten good Sodomites because he decides to kill them all in <a href="../gen/19.html#1">Genesis 19</a>. 
    Too bad Abraham didn't ask God about the children. Why not save them? If Abraham could find 10 good children, toddlers, infants, or babies, would 
    God spare the city? Apparently not. God doesn't give a damn about children. <a href="../gen/18.html#32">18:32</a>

<p><li>Lot refuses to give up his angels to the perverted mob, offering his two "virgin daughters"
instead. He tells the bunch of angel rapers to "do unto them [his daughters] as is good in your
eyes." This is the same man that is called "just" and "righteous" in 
<a href="../2pet/2.html#7">2 Peter 2:7-8</a>. <a href="../gen/19.html#8">19:8</a>

<p><li>God kills everyone (men, women, children, infants, newborns) in Sodom and Gomorrah
by raining "fire and brimstone from the Lord out of heaven." Well, almost everyone -- he
spares the "just and righteous" Lot and his family.<a href="../gen/19.html#24">19:24</a>

<p><li>Lot's nameless wife looks back, and God turns her into a pillar of salt. 
<a href="../gen/19.html#26">19:26</a>

<p><li>Lot and his daughters camp out in a cave for a while. The daughters get their "just
and righteous" father drunk, and have sexual intercourse with him, and each conceives and
bears a son (wouldn't you know it!). Just another wholesome family values Bible story. 
<a href="../gen/19.html#30">19:30-38</a>

<p><li>Honest Abe does the same "she's my sister" routine again, for the same cowardly reason.
And once again, the king just couldn't resist Sarah -- even though by now she is over 90 years
old. (See <a href="../gen/12.html#13">Gen.12:13-20</a> for the first, nearly identical, 
episode.) <a href="../gen/20.html#2">20:2</a>

<p><li>God gets angry with king Abimelech, though the king hasn't even touched Sarah. He
says to the king, "Behold, thou art but a dead man," and threatens to kill him and all of his
people. To compensate for the crime he never committed, Abimelech gives Abraham sheep,
oxen, slaves, silver, and land. Finally, after Abraham "prayed unto God," God lifts his
punishment to Abimelech, "for the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of
Abimelech, because of Sarah."  <a href="../gen/20.html#3">20:3-18</a>

<p><li>God "closed all the wombs" because Abimelech believed Abe's lie. <a href="../gen/20.html#18">20:18</a>
<p><li>Abraham married his sister, and God blessed their marriage 
(<a href="../gen/17.html#15">17:15-16</a>). <a href="../gen/20.html#12">20:12</a>

<p><li>Sarah, after giving birth to Isaac, gets angry again at Hagar (<a href="../gen/16.html#5">Gen.16:5-6</a>) and
tells Abraham to 'cast out this bondwoman and her son." God commands Abraham to
"hearken unto her voice." So Abraham abandons Hagar and Ishmael, casting them out into the
wilderness to die. <a href="../gen/21.html#10">21:10-14</a>

<p><li>After the water ran out, Hagar left Ishmael alone to die. But God heard the infant crying, so he had an angel cry to
 Hagar from heaven, telling her not to worry. God heard the child's cry and opened Hagar's eyes so she could see a well, 
 filled with water. God said he'd make Ishmael a great nation, and the child became an archer. <a href="../gen/21.html#14">21:14-20</a>

<p><li>God orders Abraham to kill Isaac as a burnt offering. Abraham shows his love for
God by his willingness to murder his son. But finally, just before Isaac's throat is slit, God
provides a goat to kill instead. <a href="../gen/22.html#2">22:2-13</a>

<p><li>Abraham shows his willingness to kill his son for God. Only an evil God would ask a father to do that; only a bad 
father would be willing to do it. <a href="../gen/22.html#10">22:10</a>

<p><li>"Because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son."<br> Why did God love Abraham so much? 
Because he was willing to murder his son for him. (Greater evil hath no man than this, that he is willing to kill his own son for God.) 
<a href="../gen/22.html#16">22:16</a>


<p><li>Abraham had several concubines. <a href="../gen/25.html#6">25:6</a>

<p><li>Isaac loved Esau because Esau was a hunter and Isaac loved venison. Rebekah loved Jacob, but God hated Esau (see 
<a href="../rom/9.html#13">Rom.9:13</a>). No reason is given for why one son is loved while 
 the other is hated. But since God chose to act this way, it must have been as an example for parents to follow. Have 
 you decided which of your children to hate? <a href="../gen/25.html#28">25:28</a>
 
<p><li>Isaac uses the same "she's my sister" lie that his father used so effectively 
(see <a href="../gen/12.html#13">Gen.12:13</a>, <a href="../gen/20.html#2">20:2</a>). <a href="../gen/26.html#7">26:7</a>

<p><li>Esau &quot;takes&quot; two wives. <a href="../gen/26.html#34">26:34</a>
<p><li>Jacob, with coaching from his mother, obtains Isaac's blessing by lying. God seems to
have been fooled as well. <a href="../gen/27.html#19">27:19</a>

<p><li>Esau, who already had two wives (<a href="../gen/26.html#34" >26:34</a>), 
"takes" another. <a href="../gen/28.html#9">28:9</a>

<p><li>Jacob offers to work for seven years to pay for Rachel. As it turns out, he is tricked 
into having sex with her sister, Leah, instead, so he has to work for another seven years so in order 
to pay for them both.  <a href="../gen/29.html#18">29:18-30</a>

<p><li>Jacob is tricked by Laban, the father of Rachel and Leah. Jacob asks for Rachel so
that he can "go in unto her." But Laban gives him Leah instead, and Jacob "went in unto her
[Leah]" by mistake. Jacob was fooled until morning -- apparently he didn't know who he was
going in unto. Finally they worked things out and Jacob got to "go in unto" Rachel, too. 
<a href="../gen/29.html#21">29:21-30</a>

<p><li>Jacob goes in unto Leah by mistake.&nbsp; <A href="../gen/29.html#23">29:23</A>, <A href="../gen/29.html#25">25</A>

<p><li>Jacob finally gets to "go in unto" Rachel. He loved Rachel more than Leah. <a href="../gen/29.html#30">29:30</a>

<p><li>Since Jacob hated Leah, God decided to "open her womb" and make Rachel barren. (Like he did to Sarah and Rebekah.) 
 <a href="../gen/29.html#31">29:31</a>
 
<p><li>Leah conceives and bears four sons. And it's a good thing, too, since her husband 
hated her until then for not giving him any sons. <a href="../gen/29.html#32-34">29:32-34</a>

<p><li>"Give me children or else I die." Rachel considers herself worthless if she cannot produce
children for her husband. But luckily she has an idea. She says to Jacob, "Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her."
She solved the problem the same way as did Sarah. (<a href="../gen/16.html#2">16:2</a>) 
"And Jacob went in unto her." <a href="../gen/30.html#1">30:1-4</a>

<p><li>Leah, not to be outdone, gives Jacob her maid (Zilpah) "to wife." And Zilpah "bare
Jacob a son." <a href="../gen/30.html#9">30:9</a>

<p><li>Rachel trades her husband's favors for some mandrakes. And so, when Jacob cam
home, Leah said: "Thou must come in unto me, for surely I have hired thee with my son's
mandrakes. And he lay with her that night." Presumably God, by telling us this edifying story, is
teaching us something about sexual ethics. <a href="../gen/30.html#15">30:15-16</a>

<p><li>Leah thinks her husband will honor her now that she has given him six sons. <a href="../gen/30.html#20">30:20</a>

<p><li>"Then Jacob ... set his ... wives upon camels." Jacob had four wives (or two wives and
two concubines -- this distinction is not clear in the Bible): Rachel, Leah, Billah, and Zilpah.
There is no indication that God disapproves of this arrangement.  <a href="../gen/31.html#17">31:17</a>

<p><li>Jacob has two wives and two concubines, continuing the biblical tradition of polygamy. <a href="../gen/32.html#22">32:22</a>

<p><li>Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, is "defiled" by a man who seems to love her dearly. Her
brothers trick all of the men of the town and kill them (after first having them all circumcised),
and then take their wives and children captive.  <a href="../gen/34.html#1">34:1-31</a>

<p><li>&quot;Reuben went and lay with his father's concubine.&quot;&nbsp; 
<a href="../gen/35.html#22">35:22</a>, <a href="../gen/49.html#4">49:4</a> 

<p><li>Esau (Isaac's son) had several wives (continuing the tradition of polygamy, with no
editorial comment from the Bible). <a href="../gen/36.html#2">36:2, 6</a>

<p><li>Jacob loved Joseph more than his other children, and he made it pretty obvious. So the other kids 
    in the family hated Joseph. (God didn't seem to mind; he liked Joseph best, too.) 
    <a href="../gen/37.html#3">37:3-4</a>
    
<p><li>Judah has casual sex with a Canaanite woman which results in two sons, Er and Onan. 
<a href="../gen/38.html#2">38:2-4</a>

<p><li>After God killed Er, Judah tells Onan to "go in unto they brother's wife." But "Onan
knew that the seed should not be his; and ... when he went in unto his brother's wife ... he
spilled it on the ground.... And the thing which he did displeased the Lord; wherefore he slew
him also." This lovely Bible story is seldom read in Sunday School, but it is the basis of many
Christian doctrines, including the condemnation of both masturbation and birth control. 
<a href="../gen/38.html#8">38:8-10</a>

<p><li>Tamar (the widow of Er and Onan, who were killed by God) dresses up as a
prostitute and Judah (her father-in-law) propositions her, saying: "Let me come in unto thee ....
And he ... came in unto her, and she conceived by him." <a href="../gen/38.html#13">38:13-18</a>
<p><li>After Judah pays Tamar for her services, he is told that she "played the harlot" and "is
with child by whoredom." When Judah hears this, he says, "Bring her forth, and let her be
burnt." <a href="../gen/38.html#24">38:24</a>

<p><li>Two of the sons of Aaron "offered strange fire before the Lord" and "there went out fire
from the Lord, and devoured them, and they died before the Lord." <a href="../lev/10.html#1">10:1-2</a>

<p><li>"And Aaron held his peace."<br>
Aaron watched in silence as God burned to death his sons. <a href="../lev/10.html#3">10:3</a>

<p><li>Moses tells Aaron that his sons were burned to death to sanctfy and glorify God. <a href="../lev/10.html#3">10:3</a>

<p><li> Moses tells Aaron's cousins to drag the burned bodies out of the camp, and he warns Aaron not to mourn the death of his sons or God will 
    kill him too, along with everyone else. <a href="../lev/10.html#4">10:4-6</a>

<p><li>"She shall be unclean."<br>
Women are dirty and sinful after childbirth, so God prescribes rituals for their purification. 
(And baby girls make them twice as sinful and dirty as baby boys do.)   <a href="../lev/12.html#1">12:1-5</a>

<p><li>"If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days ... And she shall then 
continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days."<br>
If a boy is born, the mother is unclean for 7 days and must be purified for 33 days. <a href="../lev/12.html#2">12:2, 4</a>

<p><li>"But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks ... and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying 
threescore and six days."<br>
If a girl is born, the mother is unclean for 14 days and be purified for 66 days. This is because, in the eyes of God, 
girls are twice as dirty as boys. <a href="../lev/12.html#5">12:5</a>

<p><li>"She shall bring a lamb ... for a burnt offering, and... a young pigeon, or dove, for a sin offering."<br>
After a woman gives birth, a priest must kill a lamb, pigeon, or dove as a sin offering. This is because having children is sinful and God likes it when things are 
killed for him. <a href="../lev/12.html#6">12:6</a>

<p><li>"She shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood." <a href="../lev/12.html#7">12:7</a>

and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse."  <a href="../num/5.html#15">5:15-17</a>

<p><li>"And the priest shall ... say unto the woman, If no man have lain with thee ... be thou free from this bitter water 
that causeth the curse." <a href="../num/5.html#19">5:19</a>

<p><li>"Then the priest
    shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say
    unto the woman, The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people,
    when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell." <a href="../num/5.html#20">5:20-21</a>

<p><li>"But if ... some man have lain with thee beside thine husband ... The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, 
when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell." <a href="../num/5.html#22">5:22</a>

<p><li>"And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse." <a href="../num/5.html#24">5:24</a>

<p><li>"And when he hath made her to drink the water ... if she be defiled ... the water that causeth the curse shall ... become bitter, and her belly shall swell, 
and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse among her people." <a href="../num/5.html#27">5:27</a>

<p><li>"And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed." <a href="../num/5.html#28">5:28</a>

<p><li>"Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman shall bear her iniquity." <a href="../num/5.html#31">5:31</a>

<p><li>Because of a dispute between Korah and
Moses, God has the ground open up and swallow Korah, Dathan, and Abiram "and their wives, and 
their sons, and their little children." Then, just for the hell of it, God has a fire burn to death 
250 "men that offered incense."  
<a href="../num/16.html#20">16:20-35</a>

<p><li>Another God-assisted genocide: Bashan and all his people. <a href="../num/21.html#34">21:34-35</a> 

<p><li>When one of the Israelite men brings home a foreign woman, "Phinehas (Aaron's grandson) sees them and throws a spear "through the man .. and the woman through her belly."
This act pleases God so much that "the plague was stayed from the children of Israel." But not before 
24,000 had died.  <a href="../num/25.html#6">25:6-9</a>

<p><li>For impaling the interracial couple, God rewards Phinehas and his sons with the everlasting 
priesthood. <a href="../num/25.html#10">25:10-13</a>

<p><li>Under God's direction, Moses' army defeats the Midianites. They kill all the adult males, but take the women and
children captive. When Moses learns that they left some live, he angrily says: "Have you saved all the women alive? Kill
every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. But all the women children,
that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves." So they went back and did as Moses (and
presumably God) instructed, killing everyone except for the virgins. In this way they got 32,000 virgins -- Wow! 
(Even God gets some of the booty -- including the virgins.) <a href="../num/31.html#1">31:1-54</a>

<p><li>God killed all the Egyptian firstborn. <a href="../num/33.html#4">33:4</a>

thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death.&quot;  <a href="../dt/13.html#6">13:6-10</a>

<p><li>In the cities that god "delivers into thine hands" you must kill all the males (including old men, boys, and babies) with

<p><li>"But of the cities ... which the Lord thy God doth give thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that

infants, toddlers, and babies.  <a href="../dt/20.html#16">20:16</a>

<p><li>If you see a pretty woman among the captives and would like her for a wife, then just bring her home and "go in

with stones that he die."  <a href="../dt/21.html#18">21:18-21</a>

<p><li> If a man marries, then decides that he hates his wife, he can claim she wasn't a virgin when they were married. If
her father can't produce the "tokens of her virginity" (bloody sheets), then the woman is to be stoned to death at her father's
doorstep.  <a href="../dt/22.html#13">22:13-21</a>

 <p><li>"So that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his 
        bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave: So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his 
        children whom he shall eat." <a href="../dt/28.html#54">28:54-55</a>
        
<p><li> "The tender and delicate woman" will be forced to eat her own children "that cometh out from between her 
feet."  <a href="../dt/28.html#56">28:56-57</a>

<p><li>When God gets mad -- watch out! He'll starve you to death, burn you with fire, and send vicious beasts to
devour you. He'll "destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs." Not even the
helpless and innocent are spared by this psychotic God.  <a href="../dt/32.html#21">32:21-26</a>

<p><li>Joshua's spies visit and "came unto" a prostitute in Jericho. They weren't very discreet about it either, since

<p><li>After killing everyone in Jericho, "they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein." 
<a href="../jos/6.html#24">6:24</a>

<p><li>Joshua says that those who try to rebuild Jericho will be accursed by God, and will have to sacrifice both their oldest

<p><li>If you happen to see &quot;the accursed thing,&quot; don't touch it. If you do, you, your family, and all of your animals must 
be burned. <A href="../jos/7.html#15"  >7:15</A>

<p><li>"And Joshua ... took Achan ... and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his sheep... And all of Israel

<p><li>Caleb offers to give his daughter to anyone who conquers the city of Debir. Caleb's nephew wins the contest and
is given his cousin for a prize.  <a href="../jg/1.html#12">1:12-13</a>

<p><li>Gideon orders his son to kill two kings, but he refuses. So Gideon has to do it himself since his son isn't "man"
enough to do it.  <a href="../jg/8.html#20">8:20-21</a>

<p><li>Gideon had 70 sons (no one knows how many daughters) "for he had many 
wives." <a href="../jg/8.html#30">8:30</a>

<p><li>Abimelech kills 70 brothers "upon one stone." (He was trying to get in the Guinness Book of World Records.) 
 <a href="../jg/9.html#5">9:5</a>
 
<p><li>When "the spirit of the Lord" comes upon Jephthah, he makes a deal with God: If God will help him kill the
Ammonites, then he (Jephthah) will offer to God as a burnt offering whatever comes out of his house to greet him.
God keeps his end of the deal by providing Jephthah with "a very great slaughter." But when Jephthah returns, his
nameless daughter comes out to greet him (who'd he expect, his wife?). Well, a deal's a deal, so he delivers her to
God as a burnt offering -- after letting her spend a couple of months going up and down on the mountains bewailing
her virginity.  <a href="../jg/11.html#29">11:29-39</a>

<p><li>"Her father ... did with her according to his vow which he had vowed." <a href="../jg/11.html#39">11:39</a>

<p><li>"Samson ... saw a woman ... of the daughters of the Philistines ... And Samson said unto his father ... 
Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well." <a href="../jg/14.html#1">14:1-3</a>

<p><li>After ripping up the lion, Samson went to visit the Philistine woman that he fell in lust with earlier. "And she pleased Samson well." 
<a href="../jg/14.html#7">14:7</a>

<p><li>"But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend." <a href="../jg/14.html#20">14:20</a>

<p><li>Samson's father-in-law gave Samson's wife away to a friend, since he thought Samson "hated" her. He suggests
that Samson take his younger daughter instead, saying the younger one's prettier anyway. <a href="../jg/15.html#2">15:2</a>

<p><li>"Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her." 
<a href="../jg/16.html#1">16:1</a>

<p><li>"Afterward ... he loved a woman ... whose name was Delilah." <a href="../jg/16.html#4">16:4</a>

<p><li>After taking in a traveling Levite, the host offers his virgin daughter and his guest's concubine to a mob of
perverts (who want to have sex with his guest). The mob refuses the daughter, but accepts the concubine and they
"abuse her all night." The next morning she crawls back to the doorstep and dies. The Levite puts her dead body on an
ass and takes her home. Then he chops her body up into twelve pieces and sends them to each of the twelve tribes of
Israel.  <a href="../jg/19.html#22">19:22-30</a>

<p><li>After the Israelites heard the Levite's story (about chopping up his dead concubine and sending her body parts to each 
tribe of Israel) they vowed not to "give" their daughters to the Benjamites. So now they had a problem: they just finished 
killing all the Benjamite women and children (<a href="../jg/20.html#48">Jg 20:48</a>) so there were no women for the surviving Benjamite men to marry. 
[There were 600 Benjamite men that survived the war with the Israelites. (<a href="../jg/20.html#47">Jg 20:47</a>)]  
<a href="../jg/21.html#1">21:1-7</a>  

<p><li>To find wives for the Benjamites (they were unwilling to use their own daughters), the other tribes attacked
and killed all occupants of a city except for the young virgins. These virgins were then given to the Benjamites for
wives.  <a href="../jg/21.html#7">21:7-23</a>

<p><li>Here's what the Israelites decide to do. They will go and kill everyone in Jabeshgilead except for the virgin 
women and give them to the 600 surviving Benjamites. <a href="../jg/21.html#11">21:11</a>

<p><li>So the Israelites killed all the non-virgin women and children in Jabeshgilead, bringing back 400 virgin women 
to give to the Benjamites. But they were still 200 short. Damn! <a href="../jg/21.html#12">21:12-14</a>

<p><li>Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are 
destroyed out of Benjamin?" <a href="../jg/21.html#16">21:16</a>

<p><li>So they come up with another brilliant plan. Have the Benjamites hide in the bushes and then catch the daughters 
of Shiloh when they come out to dance. So that's what they did and everyone lived happily ever after.  <a href="../jg/21.html#19">21:19-23</a>

<p><li>Boaz seems agreeable to the suggestion and says, "I will do thee all that thou requirest." Next he asks her to
"Tarry this night ... lie down until the morning." so Ruth "lay at his feet until morning." 
<a href="../ru/3.html#11">3:11-14</a>

<p><li>Boaz purchases Ruth to be his wife.  <a href="../ru/4.html#10">4:10</a>

<p><li>"The Lord had shut up her [Hannah's] womb." <a href="../1sam/1.html#5">1:5</a>

<p><li>The sons of Eli had sex with women "at the door of the tabernacle."  <a href="../1sam/2.html#22">2:22</a>

<p><li>"A man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the
    LORD ... I will cut off thine arm... There shall not be an old man in thine house for ever ... I shall ... 
    consume thine eyes and ... grieve thine heart."<br>
A "man of God" tells Eli  that God will "consume his eyes" and "grieve his heart" and make sure that all of his decendants will 
die young" because of the stuff his sons did. <a href="../1sam/2.html#27">2:27-32</a>

<p><li>"And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die 
both of them."<br>
God says he'll kill his two sons as a sign to him. (Just ot remind him of the nasty things he plans to do to him and his 
descendants to punish him for what his sons did.) <a href="../1sam/2.html#34">2:34</a>

<p><li>God will punish Eli's descendants forever for the sins of Eli's sons. <a href="../1sam/3.html#12">3:12-13</a>

  <p><li>Samuel tells Eli that God will punish his descendants forever (3:12-13) and Eli says, "Okay, whatever God wants 
is fine with me." <a href="../1sam/3.html#18">3:18</a>

<p><li>"The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain."<br>
    God killed Eli's sons as he promised to do. (See <a href="../1sam/2.25">2:25</a> and <a href="../1sam/2.html#34">34</a>) <a href="../1sam/4.html#11">4:11</a>

<p><li>God orders Saul to kill all of the Amalekites: men, women, infants, sucklings, ox, sheep, 
camels, and asses. <a href="../1sam/15.html#2">15:2-3</a>

<p><li>Saul killed everyone but Agag (the king) and the best of the animals. But still God was furious with Saul for
not killing everything as he had been told to do. He said, "it repenteth me that I have set Saul up to be king." 
 <a href="../1sam/15.html#7">15:7-26</a>
 
  <p><li>Saul is rebuked by Samuel for "doing evil in the sight of the Lord" by failing to kill all of the 
Amalekites. <a href="../1sam/15.html#18">15:18-19</a>

<p><li>Because Saul didn't kill everyone as God commanded, God changes his mind about him 
being king. <a href="../1sam/15.html#23">15:23-26</a>

<p><li>David kills 200 Philistines and brings their foreskins to Saul to buy his first wife (Saul's daughter Michal).
Saul had only asked for 100 foreskins, but David was feeling generous.  <a href="../1sam/18.html#25">18:25-27</a>

<p><li>Saul kills 85 priests of Nob and all men, women, children, and animals in the city of Nob.  <a href="../1sam/22.html#18">22:18-19</a>

<p><li>"And it came to pass about ten days after, that the Lord smote Nabal, that he died." This was convenient for
David who then took his property and his wife, Abigail.  <a href="../1sam/25.html#38">25:38</a>

<p><li>"When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD ... And David sent and communed with Abigail, 
to take her to him to wife." <a href="../1sam/25.html#39">25:39</a>

<p><li>David takes his second wife (Abigail) after God killed her husband (Nabal). He also, at the same time,
took another wife (#3), Abinam. In the meantime, Saul gave Michal (his daughter and David's first wife) to another
man.  <a href="../1sam/25.html#41">25:41-44</a>

<p><li> "And David smote the land and left neither man nor woman alive." (No wonder God liked David so much!)

<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../2sam/fv.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p><li>"David went up thither, and his two wives also." <a href="../2sam/2.html#2">2:2</a>

<p><li>David, by this time, has at least seven wives (Michal, Ahinoam, Abigail, Maacah, Haggith, Abital, and Ehlah),
and he was just getting started.  <a href="../2sam/3.html#2">3:2-5</a>

<p><li>David says, "deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines."
Well, he actually paid with two hundred foreskins (see <a href="../1sam/18.html#27">1 Sam.18:27</a>).  
<a href="../2sam/3.html#14">3:14</a>

<p><li>Michal was bought by David with 200 Philistine foreskins 
(<A href="../1sam/18.html#25">1 Sam.18:25-27</A>), then she was "given" 
to Phatiel (<A href="../1sam/25.html#44">1 Sam.25:44</A>), and then "taken back" by David. 
Poor Phatiel must have loved her dearly since he "went along weeping behind her." 
<a href="../2sam/3.html#15">3:15-16</a>

<p><li>"And David took him more concubines and wives." (How many? God knows I suppose, but he doesn't tell us in
the Bible.)  <a href="../2sam/5.html#13">5:13</a>

<p><li>King David dances nearly naked in front of God and everybody. When Michal criticizes him for exposing himself, God punishes her by
having "no child unto the day of her death." Although <A href="../2sam/21.html#8">2 Sam.21:8</A> says that she had five sons (which were sacrificed 
to God by David to stop God from starving people to death). <a href="../2sam/6.html#14">6:14-23</a>

<p><li>David sees a woman (Bathsheba) bathing and likes what he sees. so he sends for her and commits adultery
with her "for she was purified from her uncleanness." She conceives and bears a son (of course).  
<a href="../2sam/11.html#2">11:2-5</a>

<p><li>David tells Joab (his captain) to send Bathsheba's husband (Uriah) to "the forefront of the hottest battle
... that he may be smitten and die." In this way, David gets another wife.  <a href="../2sam/11.html#15">11:15</a>, 
<a href="../2sam/11.html#17">11:17</a>, <a href="../2sam/11.html#27">11:27</a>

<p><li>God gave the wives of king Saul to David. <a href="../2sam/12.html#7">12:7-8</a>

<p><li>God is angry at David for having Uriah killed. As a punishment, he will have David's wives raped by his
neighbor while everyone else watches. It turns out that the "neighbor" that God sends to do his dirty work is David's
own son, Absalom (<a href="../2sam/16.html#22">16:22</a>).  <a href="../2sam/12.html#11">12:11-12</a>

<p><li>To punish David for having Uriah killed, God kills Bathsheba's baby boy.  <a href="../2sam/12.html#14">12:14-18</a>
<p><li>After Bathsheba's baby is killed by God, David comforts her by going "in unto her." She conceives and bears
another son (Solomon).  <a href="../2sam/12.html#24">12:24</a>

<p><li>Ammon (David's son) says to his half-sister Tamar, "Come lie with me, my sister." But she resists, so he
rapes her and then sends her away. Tamar, knowing that she now belongs to him (since she was a virgin), expects him
to marry her, but he refuses.  <a href="../2sam/13.html#1">13:1-22</a>

<p><li>"When king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth."<br>
The <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/nrs/2-samuel/13-21.html">New Revised Standard Version adds</a>, "but he would not punish 
his son Amnon, because he loved him, for he was his firstborn."<br>
David loved Ammon "because he was his firstborn" (good parents love their firstborn sons more than their other kids). As 
<a href="http://www.thebricktestament.com/king_david/davids_son_rapes_davids_daughter/2s13_21b.html">the Brick Testament suggests</a>, 
he probably said something like, "Oh well, I guess firstborns are entitled to one free incestuous rape." <a href="../2sam/13.html#21">13:21</a>  

<p><li>Absalom has his servants kill his brother for raping his sister. (This chapter, which includes incest, rape,
murder, should be rated NC-17.)  <a href="../2sam/13.html#28">13:28-29</a>

<p><li>"And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house."</i><br>
David left Jerusalem because he was afraid that his son Absalom was going to kill him. But he left his 
concubines to fend for themselves.  <a href="../2sam/15.html#16">15:16</a>

<p><li>Absalom "went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel." This was according the God's plan
as announced in <a href="../2sam/2.html#11">2 Sam.12:11-12</a>.  <a href="../2sam/16.html#21">16:21-22</a>

<p><li>To punish his ten concubines for
being raped by his son, Absalom (See <a href="../2sam/16.html#21">16:21-22</a>), 
David refuses to ever again have sex with them and forces them to 
"keep house" for the rest of their lives. <a href="../2sam/20.html#3">20:3</a>

<p><li>To appease God and end the famine that was caused by his predecessor (Saul), David agrees to have two of Saul's sons and five 
of his grandsons killed and hung up "unto the Lord."  <a href="../2sam/21.html#6">21:6-9</a>

<p><li>"They hanged them in the hill before the LORD." <a href="../2sam/21.html#9">21:9</a>

<p><li>"They gathered the bones of them that were hanged ... And after that God was intreated for the land."<br>
God stopped the famine after Saul's two sons and five grandsons were killed and hung up for him. <a href="../2sam/21.html#13">21:13-14</a>

<p><li>In David's last words, he commands his son Solomon to murder Joab and Shimei.  <a href="../1kg/2.html#1">2:1-9</a>

<p><li>Adonijah (Solomon's half-brother) sends Bathsheba (Solomon's mother) to ask King Solomon to 
let Adonijah have sex with his David's concubine Abishag. But 
Solomon had him murdered instead. <a href="../1kg/2.html#13">2:13-25</a>

<p><li>Solomon has his brother (Adonijah) murdered.  <a href="../1kg/2.html#24">2:24-25</a>

<p><li>Solomon carries out the deathbed instructions of his father David by having Joab murdered.  <a href="../1kg/2.html#29">2:29-34</a>

<p><li>"King Solomon loved many strange women."<br>
God didn't mind the number so much; it was their "strangeness" that he objected to.  <a href="../1kg/11.html#1">11:1</a>

<p><li>"He had seven hundred wives ... and three hundred concubines." <a href="../1kg/11.html#1">11:1</a>

<p><li>"In thy days I will not do it for David thy father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son."<br>
God is angry with Solomon, but decides to punish Solomon's son rather than Solomon himself, because he liked Solomon's 
father (David) so darned much. <a href="../1kg/11.html#11">11:11-12</a>

<p><li>"When thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die." <a href="../1kg/14.html#12">14:12</a>

<p><li>"When she came to the threshold of the door, the child died."<br>
To punish Jeroboam for making gold calves, God killed his son.  <a href="../1kg/14.html#17">14:17</a>

<p><li>Did Abijam marry his own mother?<br>
  Since Asa's father was Abijam and they had the same mother (Maachah), Abijam was both father and 
  brother to Asa. <a href="../1kg/15.html#9">15:9-10</a>
  
<p><li>Baasha kills "all of the house of Jeroboam" leaving none "to breath." This slaughter was done "according to the
word of the Lord."  <a href="../1kg/15.html#29">15:29</a>

<p><li>"I will ... make thy house like the house of Jeroboam. Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; 
and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat."<br>
God says he's going to kill Baasha's family (like he did Jeroboam's). <a href="../1kg/16.html#3">16:3-4</a>

<p><li>"He slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, 
nor of his friends. Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD."<br> 
Zimri kills everyone "that <a href="../topics/piss.html">pisseth
against a wall</a> ... according to the word of the Lord." <a href="../1kg/16.html#11">16:11-12</a>

<p><li>"He laid the foundation  thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his
    youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD."<br>
When Hiel rebuilds Jericho, he lays the foundation with the body of his oldest son and sets up the gates with his
youngest son's body "according to the word of the Lord."<br>
Did God want Hiel to sacrifice his sons in this way? Did he make him do it? What does "according to the word of the Lord" mean here?
  <a href="../1kg/16.html#34">16:34</a>
  
<p><li>"Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: 
but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house."<br>
Since Ahab humbles himself before the Lord, God decides not to bring evil on him; he'll 
<a href="../2kg/9.html#24" title="2Kg 9:24-25">he'll bring it on Ahab's son</a> instead. <a href="../1kg/21.html#29">21:29</a>

<p><li>"He took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines."  <a href="../2chr/11.html#21">11:21b</a>

<p><li>"And begat twenty and eight sons, and threescore daughters."</i><br>
Rehoboam had 88 children (28 sons and 60 daughters) and wins

Quiverfull prize</a>.  <a href="../2chr/11.html#21">11:21c</a>

<p><li>"But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives." Apparently, in the eyes of God, a man's status is
determined by the number of wives that he possesses.  <a href="../2chr/13.html#21">13:21</a>

<p><li>"Whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or
    great, whether man or woman." <a href="../2chr/15.html#13">15:13</a>
    
<p><li>Elijah tells Jehoram that God will smite his children, wives, and the people of Judah with a 
great plague (for things that Jehoram did) and God will smite him with a disease of his bowels until 
his bowels fall out.  <a href="../2chr/21.html#14">21:14-15</a>

<p><li>The LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians ... 
And they came up into Judah, and ... and carried away ... his sons also, and his wives; so that there 
was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons." <a href="../2chr/21.html#16">21:16-17</a>

<p><li>"Jehoiada took for him two wives" -- without comment, complaint, or criticism from the bible.

 their fathers." <a href="../2chr/28.html#6">28:6, 8</a>
<p><li>God gets angry with his people, so he sends the king of the Chaldees to kill all the "young men with the
sword." He has compassion for no one, not even old men that are "stooped for age." In his tender mercy and loving
kindness he has them all slaughtered.  <a href="../2chr/36.html#16">36:16-17</a>

<p><li>King Ahasuerus throws a party and encourages his guests to drink to excess. Then, when they are all drunk, he orders
Queen Vashti to show her stuff before him and his guests.  <a href="../est/1.html#7">1:7-11</a>

<p><li>Vashti refuses to entertain the king's drunken guests by dancing before them. For this she is no longer to be queen,
to be replaced by someone better (prettier?).  <a href="../est/1.html#12">1:12-19</a>

<p><li>Because of Vashti's disobedience, the king decrees that "all the wives shall give to their husbands honor, both the
great and the small" and "that every man should bear rule over his own house."  
<a href="../est/1.html#20">1:20-22</a>

<p><li>"All the fair young virgins" throughout the kingdom are brought before the king, and the one that "pleaseth" the
king the most will replace Vashti. <a href="../est/2.html#2">2:2-4</a>

<p><li>When it was Esther turn to "go in unto the king," she pleases the king the most. So, having won the sex
contest, she is made queen in Vashti's place.  <a href="../est/2.html#8">2:8-9, 12-17</a>

<p><li>At Esther's request, the king orders a preemptive strike on all 127 provinces from Egypt to Ethiopia. Everyone who planned 
    to kill Jews shall be killed by Jews, along with their wives and children. And all this killing is to take place on a single day. <br>
    (How are the Jews to figure out who planned to kill them and who didn't? Were they supposed to just kill them all and let God sort it out? 
    And why did they need to kill the women and children?)  <a href="../est/8.html#9">8:9-11</a>
    
<p><li>The Jews kill everyone who ever had a bad thought toward them, along with their Jew-hating families. <a href="../est/9.html#1">9:1-16</a>  

<p><li>"The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they." <a href="../est/9.html#10">9:10</a>

<p><li>"The king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed
    five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman ... what is thy request further? ... 
    Then said Esther ... let Haman's ten sons be hanged."  <br>
        Esther tells the king to hang the already dead bodies of Haman's ten sons on trees. Why? Would they make nice decorations? To show everyong 
    what will happen to your children if you try to mistreat Jews? <a href="../est/9.html#12">9:12-14</a>

Women will then become so desperate that "seven women will take hold of one man, saying ... let us be called by thy name, to
take away our reproach."  <a href="../is/4.html#1">4:1</a>

<p><li>God will have no mercy on the widows and children of hypocrites. <a href="../is/9.html#17">9:17</a>

<p><li>If God can find you, he will "thrust you through," smash your children "to pieces" before your eyes, and rape your wife.
He will have no mercy, but will even kill your little children.  <a href="../is/13.html#15">13:15-18</a>

<p><li>God will slaughter children "for the iniquity of their fathers." <a href="../is/14.html#21">14:21</a>

    God will cause Sennacherib to be killed by the sword. (See <a href="../is/37.html#38">verse 38</a> where Sennacherib is

<p><li> A divorced woman is &quot;polluted&quot; when she remarries. The man, of course, remains perfectly 
clean through it all, even though he was the one who &quot;put her away&quot; in the first place. 
<a href="../jer/3.html#1">3:1</a>

<p><li> &quot;As a wife treacherously departeth from her husband ...&quot; If a woman leaves her husband, she 
is &quot;treacherous,&quot; but a man is blameless when he &quot;puts her away&quot; for no 
reason. <a href="../jer/3.html#20">3:20</a>

<p><li>God just can't hold in his fury any longer. He will kill everyone: husbands and wives, children and old people.

<p><li>"How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have ... committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses."

<p><li> God will punish the men by taking away their property, including their wives, and giving it to others.
 <a href="../jer/6.html#12">6:12</a>

<p><li> God plans to kill pretty much everyone: fathers and sons, 
family, friends, and neighbors. God plans to kill them all after laying a stumbling block before them.
 <a href="../jer/6.html#21">6:21</a>
 
<p><li>"Therefore will I give their wives unto others." <a href="../jer/8.html#10">8:10</a>

<p><li> Don't trust anyone. Not even your neighbors, family, or friends. Those who 
believe differently than you are all liars and evil doers. <a href="../jer/9.html#4">9:4-6</a>

<p><li> God will kill children and young men, and the dead bodies "shall fall as dung .... and none shall 
gather them."  <a href="../jer/9.html#21">9:21-22</a>

<p><li> Jeremiah prays for the destruction of people and families that don't call on God's name. 
<a href="../jer/10.html#25">10:25</a>

<p><li>&quot;Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the 
young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine.&quot;
<a href="../jer/11.html#22">11:22</a>

<p><li> God plans to make everyone in the kingdom drunk and then "dash the fathers and the sons 
together." The merciful God of peace vows to "not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy them."  <a href="../jer/13.html#12">13:12-14</a>

<p><li> God will kill children and make widows as numerous as grains of sand. <a href="../jer/15.html#7">15:7-8</a>

<p><li> God tells Jeremiah not to get married or have children, because he's 
going to kill everyone (mothers and daughters, fathers and sons). They all &quot;shall die of grievous 
deaths,&quot; and that shall neither &quot;be lamented&quot; nor buried, but &quot;shall 
be as dung upon the face of the earth.&quot;  For he has removed peace, "lovingkindness," and mercy 
from the people.  <a href="../jer/16.html#1">16:1-7</a>

<p><li> Jeremiah asks God to kill the young men in war and the children by starvation. 
<a href="../jer/18.html#21">18:21</a>

<p><li> God will make parents eat their own children and friends each other.  <a href="../jer/19.html#7">19:7-9</a>

<p><li>God will have Jeconiah's enemies kill him and his mother and then 
ensure that he die without leaving any sons. <a href="../jer/22.html#25">22:25-30</a>
 
<p><li>God will punish the children of Shemaiah for their father's false prophecy. <a href="../jer/29.html#32">29:32</a>

<p><li> God sends a &quot;man clothed with linen&quot; to mark the foreheads of the men who will 
be saved. Apparently only men are considered good enough to keep, the others (unmarked men, 
&quot;maids&quot;, little children, and women) are to be slaughtered. God says he'll &quot;fill 
the courts with the slain&quot; and will have pity on no one. <a href="../ezek/9.html#4">9:4-10</a>

<p><li>"Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women." <a href="../ezek/9.html#6">9:6</a>

<p><li>When really bad things happen (like you or your children get eaten by wild beasts, get killed in war, get sick and die, etc.), then you'll know that it was God that did it to you. 
And he won't spare children just because there are a few righteous people around. <a href="../ezek/14.html#13">14:13-21</a>

<p><li>"All souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine." <a href="../ezek/18.html#4">18:4</a>

<p><li> Two sisters were guilty of &quot;committing whoredoms&quot; by pressing their breasts and 
bruising &quot;the teats of their virginity.&quot; As a punishment, one sister's nakedness was 
discovered, her children were taken from her, and she was killed by the sword. And the fate of the 
surviving sister was even worse: Her nose and ears were cut off, she was made to &quot;pluck off&quot; 
her own breasts, and then after being raped and mutilated, she is stoned to death. 
<a href="../ezek/23.html#1">23:1-49</a>

<p><li>"These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword." <a href="../ezek/23.html#10">23:10</a>

<p><li> God kills Ezekiel's wife and then tells him not to mourn her.  <a href="../ezek/24.html#15">24:16-18</a>

<p><li> God killed Ezekiel's wife to demonstrate his intention to kill the Israelites' children. And just as God told Ezekiel not to mourn his wife's death, 
God forbids the parents to mourn the death of their children. <a href="../ezek/24.html#21">24:21-24</a>
