<p><li>"The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem ... I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem ... I am come to great 
estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me."<br>
The author of Ecclesiastes claims to be the wise, rich son of King David, which is to say, Solomon. He isn't. Ecclesiastes was written 
(forged) about six hundred years after Solomon died (if he ever lived, that is). <a href="1.html#1">1:1, 12, 16</a>

<p><li>"He hath made every thing beautiful."<br>
Everything is beautiful in its own way. Parasitic worms, cancer cells, bubonic plague. You just have to look at it from God's eyes.

<p><li>"No man can find out the work that God maketh."<br>
Science is impossible. We can learn nothing at all about the natural world. <a href="3.html#11">3:11b</a>

<p><li>"That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?"<br>
    Who can find out? We can by using science! The earth, ocean, solar system, galaxy, and universe -- nothing is too deep or far away for 
    science to discover and explore. <a href="7.html#24">7:24</a>

<p><li>"Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work
    that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet
    he shall not find it; yea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet
    shall he not be able to find it."<br>
    Oh, I think science has done a pretty good job of finding things out over the last four centuries or so. <a href="8.html#16">8:16</a>

<p><li>"Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days." <a href="11.html#1">11:1</a>

<p><li>"In the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be." <a href="11.html#3">11:3</a>

<p><li>"He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap." <a href="11.html#4">11:4</a>
