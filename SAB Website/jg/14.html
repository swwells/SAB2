<td bgcolor="eeeeee" rowspan="21">

<font size="-1">    
    <IMG src="../images/wom1.gif" >
    <IMG src="../images/sex1.gif" >
    <IMG src="../images/fv.gif" > (14:1-3) <br>The first thing the Bible tells us about Samson is this:    
    
    <p>(14:1) <i>"Samson ... saw a woman ... of the daughters of the Philistines."</i>
    
    <p>(14:3) <i>"And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well."</i>
    
    <p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (14:4) Now Samson's parents were a bit troubled by this, since they knew how crazy God gets 
    when an Israelite even thinks about marrying a non-Israelite. But  they didn't know that Samson's lust for the Philistine woman was "of the Lord." 
    It was all a part of God's plan for killing Philistines.
    
    <p>(14:4) <i>"But his father and his mother knew not that <b>it was of the LORD</b>, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines."</i>    
    
    <p><IMG src="../images/cr1.gif" > 
    <IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (14:5-6) Samson was on his way to visit his new Philistine girlfriend when "the Spirit of the Lord came mightily" 
    upon him, and he ripped up a young lion.
    
    <p>(14:5) <i>"Behold, a young lion roared against him."</i>
    
    <p>(14:6) <i>"And <b>the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, 
    and he rent him as he would have rent a kid."</i></b>
    
   <p><IMG src="../images/wom1.gif" >
    <IMG src="../images/sex1.gif" >
    <IMG src="../images/fv.gif" >
    <img src="../images/abs1.gif">
    <IMG src="../images/sci1.gif" >  (14:7-9)<br> When he arrived at his Philistine girlfriend's place, "she pleased Samson well."
 Then he returned home. On his way he saw the lion carcass, which was covered with bees and filled with honey 
 (a meaningless miracle -- or just rotting flesh and maggots?) and Samson ate some of it. He liked it so much that he took 
     a few handfuls home to feed to his parents. (He didn't tell them where it came from.) 
   
    <p>(14:7) <i>"She pleased Samson well."</i><br>
   
    <p>(14:8) <i>"Behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the  lion."</i>
    
    <p>(14:9) <i>"And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: 
    but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion."</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (14:10-14) The Bible doesn't actaully say so, but I guess Samson married he Philistine 
woman that pleased him well. Then he had a week-long party with thirty of his new-found Philistine friends.

<p>At the party, Samson told a riddle. Whoever can figure it out before the week of partying is over will get 30 sheets and 30 garments. But whoever can't will 
    have to give Samuel 30 sheets and 30 garments. Here's the riddle: "Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness." 

<p>(14:10) <i>"Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do."</i>

<p>(14:11) <i>"They brought thirty companions to be with him."</i>

<p>(14:12) <i>"And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast ... I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments."</i><br>
  
<p>(14:13) <i>"But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments."</i>   

<p>(14:14) <i>"And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness."</i>   

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (14:15-17) Samson's party buddies took the riddle seriously. They tell Samson's new Philistine wife to tell them the answer to the riddle or 
    they'll burn her house down. After crying in front of Samson for seven days, she finally got the answer from Samson, and she told the guys at the party. 
    
<p>(14:15) <i>"Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn
    thee and thy father's house with fire."</i>    
    
<p>(14:17) <i>"She wept before him the seven days ... and ... on the seventh day ... he told her ... and she told the riddle to ... her people."</i>

<p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" >
<IMG src="../images/wom1.gif" >
        <IMG src="../images/sex1.gif" >(14:18) So Samson didn't get his 30 sets of sheets and garments, and he was pissed off about it. 
        He said if they hadn't of "plowed with his heifer" they'd have never found out the riddle. 

<p> (14:18) <i>"If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle."</i>
    
    <p><IMG src="../images/cr1.gif" >
    <IMG src="../images/inj1.gif" > (14:19) <br><b><a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2009/11/gods-51st-killing-samsons-riddle-and.html">The Spirit of the Lord comes upon Samson and he 
    murders 30 men for their clothes</a></b><br>
    Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Samson, and he killed 30 men at random, took their clothes, and gave it to the guys at the 
	party as a prize for guessing his riddle.<br>
	(Samson might have been a decent person if he could have kept the spirit of the Lord off him.)<br>
