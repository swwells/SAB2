<p><li>God swears by himself to himself. <a href="6.html#13">6:13</a>

<p><li>"Melchisedec ... to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all."
Abraham gave Melchisedec one-tenth of all of the booty from "the slaughter of the kings," 
setting a fine example for religious hucksters everywhere. <a href="7.html#1">7:1-2</a>

<p><li>Melchisedec had no father or mother. He was never born (he just appeared ready-made by God) and he never died. 
He's still around somewhere. <a href="7.html#1">7:1-3</a>

<p><li>God will not forgive anyone unless something is killed for him in a bloody manner. <a href="9.html#13">9:13-22</a>

<p><li>"For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry." <a href="10.html#37">10:37</a>

<p><li>Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." <br>
    Faith is believing without evidence things that you wish were true (but aren't). <a href="11.html#1">11:1</a>
    
<p><li>"Enoch was translated that he should not see death." <a href="11.html#5">11:5</a>    
    
<p><li>"By faith Noah ... condemned  the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith." <a href="11.html#7">11:7</a>

<p><li>"Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed." <a href="11.html#11">11:11</a>

<p><li>"Therefore sprang ... so many as the stars of the sky ... and as the sand ... by the sea shore innumerable." 
(OK, so maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration.) <a href="11.html#12">11:12</a>
 
 <p><li>"By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land." <a href="11.html#29">11:29</a>
 
 <p><li>"By faith the walls of Jericho fell down."  <a href="11.html#30">11:30</a>
 
 <p><li>"Time would fail me to tell of Gideon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthah; of David also, and Samuel, 
 and of the prophets."</i><br>
<a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2006/08/heroes-of-faith.html">The heroes of faith</a>: Gideon, Samson, Jephthah, 
David, and Samuel. It would be hard to find a more monstrous group than these guys.  <a href="11.html#32">11:32</a>

<p><li>"Others were tortured ... that they might obtain a better resurrection." <a href="11.html#35">11:35</a>

<p><li>"Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth." <a href="12.html#6">12:6</a>

<p><li>"What son is he whom the father chasteneth not?"<br>
What kind of father doesn't beat his sons now and then? <a href="12.html#7">12:7</a>

<p><li>God always hurts the ones he loves. And if God doesn't hurt you, you are a
bastard, not a son. <a href="12.html#6">12:8</a>

<p><li>God ordered animals to be "stoned, or thrust through with a dart" if they "so much as ... touch the mountain."
 <a href="12.html#20">12:20</a>

<p><li>"Ye are come ... to the blood of  sprinkling, that speaketh better things that that of Abel." <a href="12.html#22">12:22-24</a>

<p><li>"Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying ... I shake not the earth only, but also heaven."<br>
    When God speaks there are earthquakes (and heavenquakes). <a href="12.html#26">12:26</a>

<p><li>Be hospitable to strangers for "thereby some have entertained angels." <a href="13.html#2">13:2</a>

<p><li>Avoid "strange doctrines." Those who do so will avoid nearly everything that the Bible teaches. <a href="13.html#9">13:9</a>
