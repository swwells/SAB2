  <tr><td><B><A name="25">37:25</A></B>
  And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant,
    wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, even they,
    and their children, and their children's children for ever: and my servant
    David shall be their prince for ever.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="26">37:26</A></B>
  Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an
    everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them,
    and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="27">37:27</A></B>
  My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they
    shall be my people.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="28">37:28</A></B>
  And the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel, when my
    sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.
