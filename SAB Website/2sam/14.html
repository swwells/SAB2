  <tr><td><B><A name="7">14:7</A></B>
  And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they
    said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life
    of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they
    shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband
    neither name nor remainder upon the earth.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that

    to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath
    spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the

    Absolom was the best looking guy in all of Israel. He didn't have a blemish on his whole body.

        Since a shekel is about 11.5 grams, Absolom's hair weighed 2.3 kilograms!

  <span class="a">And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he
    polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he
    weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.</span>

  <span class="c">And unto Absalom there
    were born three sons</span>, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a
    woman of a fair countenance.

  So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face.
  
  <tr><td><B><A name="29">14:29</A></B>
  Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he
    would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not
    come.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="30">14:30</A></B>
  Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and
    he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the
    field on fire.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="31">14:31</A></B>
  Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him,
    Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="32">14:32</A></B>
  And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither,
    that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur?
    it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see
    the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="33">14:33</A></B>
  So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for
    Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground
    before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.
