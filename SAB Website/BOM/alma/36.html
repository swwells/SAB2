"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",
"<span class='i'>Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever.</span>--<a href='3.html#14'>Alma 3:14</a>",
"<span class='i'>I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</span>--<a href='3.html#15'>Alma 3:15</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",
"<span class='a'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges ... even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year....</span>--<a href='16.html#1'>Alma 16:1</a>",
"<span class='a'>Their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.</span>--<a href='16.html#11'>Alma 16:11</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",

"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",

"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",

"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",
"<span class='i'>These dissenters ... became ... more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='47.html#36'>Alma 47:36</a>",
"<span class='a'>God would prosper them in the land, or in other words ... God ... would prosper them in the land.</span>--<a href='48.html#15'>Alma 48:15</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='50.html#22'>Alma 50:22</a>",
"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",
"<span class='i'>The remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty.</span>--<a href='51.html#20'>Alma 51:20</a>",
"<span class='g'>And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye.</span>--<a href='54.html#21'>Alma 54:21</a>",

<td bgcolor="eeeeee">


<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>36:1</b>   My son, give ear to my words; for I swear unto you, that inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments 
of God ye shall prosper in the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>36:2</b>   I would that ye should do as I have done, in remembering the captivity of our fathers; for they 
were in bondage, and none could deliver them except it was the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God 
of Jacob; and he surely did deliver them in their afflictions. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>36:3</b>   And now, O my son Helaman, behold, thou art in thy youth, and therefore, I beseech of thee that 
thou wilt hear my words and learn of me; for I do know that whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported 
in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions, and shall be lifted up at the last day. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>36:4</b>   And I would not that ye think that I know of myself -- not of the temporal but of the spiritual, 
not of the carnal mind but of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>36:5</b>   Now, behold, I say unto you, if I had not been born of God I should not have known these things; 
but God has, by the mouth of his holy angel, made these things known unto me, not of any worthiness of myself. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>36:6</b>   For I went about with the sons of Mosiah, seeking to destroy the church of God; but behold, God 
sent his holy angel to stop us by the way. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>36:7</b>   And behold, he spake unto us, as it were the voice of thunder, and the whole earth did tremble 
beneath our feet; and we all fell to the earth, for the fear of the Lord came upon us. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>36:8</b>   But behold, the voice said unto me: Arise.  And I arose and stood up, and beheld the angel. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>36:9</b>   And he said unto me: If thou wilt of thyself be destroyed, seek no more to destroy the church of 
God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>36:10</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that I fell to the earth; and it was for the space 
of three days and three nights that I could not open my mouth, neither had I the use of my limbs. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32"><a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a> (36:10, 17)
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>36:11</b>   And the angel spake more things unto me, which were heard by my brethren, but I did not hear 
them; for when I heard the words -- If thou wilt be destroyed of thyself, seek no more to destroy the church of 
God -- I was struck with such great fear and amazement lest perhaps I should be destroyed, that I fell to the 
earth and I did hear no more. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>36:12</b>   But I was racked with eternal torment, for my soul was harrowed up to the greatest degree 
and racked with all my sins. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>36:13</b>   Yea, I did remember all my sins and iniquities, for which I was tormented with the pains of 
hell; yea, I saw that I had rebelled against my God, and that I had not kept his holy commandments. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>36:14</b>   Yea, and I had murdered many of his children, or rather led them away unto destruction; yea, 
and in fine so great had been my iniquities, that the very thought of coming into the presence of my God did rack 
my soul with inexpressible horror. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>36:15</b>   Oh, thought I, that I could be banished and become extinct both soul and body, that I might 
not be brought to stand in the presence of my God, to be judged of my deeds. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>36:16</b>   And now, for three days and for three nights was I racked, even with the pains of a damned 
soul. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>36:17</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that as I was thus racked with torment, while 
I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy 
unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the 
world. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>36:18</b>   Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son 
of God, have mercy on me, <span class="plag">who am in the gall of bitterness</span>, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains 
of death. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/plag.gif" border="0" width="32" height="32">
Thou art in the gall of bitterness -- <a href="../../acts/8.html#23">Acts.8:23</a>
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>36:19</b>   And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed 
up by the memory of my sins no more. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>36:20</b>   And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy 
as <span class="a">exceeding</span> as was my pain! <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32"><a href="exceed_list.html">Exceedingly</a> (36:20, 24, 25)
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>36:21</b>   Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were 
my pains.  Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite 
and sweet as was my joy. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>36:22</b>   Yea, methought I saw, even as our father Lehi saw, God 
sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels, in the attitude of singing and 
praising their God; yea, and my soul did long to be there. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>36:23</b>   But behold, my limbs did receive their strength again, and I stood upon my feet, and did 
manifest unto the people that I had been born of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>36:24</b>   Yea, and from that time even until now, I have labored without ceasing, that I might bring 
souls unto repentance; that I might bring them to taste of the <span class="a">exceeding</span> joy of which I did taste; that they 
might also be born of God, and be filled with the Holy Ghost. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>36:25</b>   Yea, and now behold, O my son, the Lord doth give me <span class="a">exceedingly</span> great 
joy in the fruit of my labors; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>36:26</b>   For because of the word which he has imparted unto me, behold, many have been born of God, 
and have tasted as I have tasted, and have seen eye to eye as I have seen; therefore they do know of these 
things of which I have spoken, as I do know; and the knowledge which I have is of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>36:27</b>   And I have been supported under trials and troubles of every kind, yea, and in all manner of 
afflictions; yea, God has delivered me from prison, and from bonds, and from death; yea, and I do put my trust 
in him, and he will still deliver me. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">


<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>36:28</b>   And I know that <span class="plag">he will raise me up at the last day</span>, to dwell with him in glory; yea, and 
I will praise him forever, for he has brought our fathers out of Egypt, and he has swallowed up the Egyptians 
in the Red Sea; and he led them by his power into the promised land; yea, and he has delivered them out of 
bondage and captivity from time to time. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">

And I will raise him up at the last day. -- <a href="../../jn/6.html#40">John 6:40</a></font>

<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>36:29</b>   Yea, and he has also brought our fathers out of the land of Jerusalem; and he has also, 
by his everlasting power, delivered them out of bondage and captivity, from time to time even down to the 
present day; and I have always retained in remembrance their captivity; yea, and ye also ought to retain 
in remembrance, as I have done, their captivity. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>36:30</b>   But behold, my son, this is not all; for ye ought to know as I do know, that inasmuch as 
ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper in the land; and ye ought to know also, that inasmuch 
as ye will not keep the commandments of God ye shall be cut off from his presence.  Now this is according to 
his word. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
