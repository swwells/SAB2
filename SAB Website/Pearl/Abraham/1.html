<img src="../../images/sci1.gif">(1:1, 8, 13, 14, 20, 23, 29, 30)<br>
<i>"In the land of the Chaldeans"</i><br>
The word "Chaldeans" is an anachronism<sup><a href="#n1">1</sup></a>. The Chaldeans first appeared in the 9th century BCE, 1000 years before 
Abraham supposedly lived.  

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif">
<img src="../../images/sci1.gif">(1:1)<i>"I, Abraham"</i><br>
Although Joseph Smith said that the Book of Abraham was written by Abraham "in his own hand, upon papyrus," there is no mention of Abraham's name 
anywhere in the papyri or the facsimiles that Joseph Smith claimed to interpret.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (1:2)
<i>"And, finding there was greater happiness and peace and rest for me, I sought for the 
blessings of the fathers, and the right whereunto I should be ordained to administer the same; having been myself 
a follower of righteousness, desiring also to be one who possessed great knowledge, and to be a greater follower 
of righteousness, and to possess a greater knowledge.... ... ..." </i><br>
How did Abraham manage to get all this useless, redundant, and completely unnecessary babbling on the little scrap of papyrus that Joseph 
Smith translated?

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (1:3)
<i>"It came down from the fathers, from the beginning of time, yea, even from the beginning, or before the foundation of the earth, down to 
the present time, even the right of the firstborn, or the first man, who is Adam."</i><br>
Abraham became a priest because he was a descendent of Adam. (Isn't everyone 
supposedly a descendent of Adam?)

<p><img src="../../images/sci1.gif"> (1:3)
<i>"The first man, who is Adam."</i><br>
I guess this means that Mormons can't believe in human evolution. (Who would 
have thought that Abraham would have known about Adam?)

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (1:4) Abraham was a priest "concerning the seed." (Whatever the hell that means.)

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (1:5) <i>"My fathers having turned from ... the holy commandments which the Lord their God had given unto them."</i><br>
God gave the commandments to Abraham's ancestors? And all those silly Christians thought it was Moses! (<a href="../../ex/20.html">Exodus 20</a>, 
<a href="../../dt/5.html">Deuteronomy 5</a>)

<p><img src="../../images/int.gif">(1:6) "For their hearts were set to do evil, and were wholly turned to" other gods.

<!--
<p><img src="../../images/sci1.gif"> (1:6, 7, 13, 17, 20, 29)
<i>"The god of Elkenah, and the god of Libnah, and the god of Mahmackrah, and the god of Korash."</i><br>
There is no record of any of these gods in Egyptian history. 
-->

<p><p><img src="../../images/sci1.gif"> (1:6-10, 13, 17, 20, 25-27)<br>
"Pharaoh" is an anachronism (a term that would not have been used at the time of Abraham).<sup><a href="#n3">3</sup></a>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif">(1:7) <i>"Offering up their children unto these dumb idols"</i><br>
So those nasty Egyptians sacrificed their own children to God. But why would that bother Abraham? He was willing to sacrifice 
Isaac. (<a href="../../gen/22.html#10">Genesis 22:10</a>)

<p><img src="../../images/sci1.gif">(1:8)<br>
<i>"The offering unto these strange gods, men, women, and children"</i><br>
There is no evidence for human sacrifice among the Egyptians of 2000 BCE.

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (1:9,12) <a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a>

<p><img src="../../images/sci1.gif">(1:9)<br>
<i>"Now the god of Shagreel was the sun."</i><br>
No, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra">Ra</a> was the Egyptian sun god.

<p><img src="../../images/sci1.gif">(1:10, 20)<br>
Anachronism: Potiphar's Hill<sup><a href="#n4">4</sup></a> 

<p><img src="../../images/int.gif"> (1:11) <i>"From the loins of Ham"</i><br>

<p><img src="../../images/sci1.gif"> (1:12)
<i>"I will refer you to the representation at the commencement of this record."</i><br>
The facsimile that Joseph Smith (er, Abraham -- excuse me!) refers to does not show a man (supposedly Abraham) being sacrificed, but rather an 
Egyptian priest being embalmed. Since facsimile 1 dates from approximately 100 BCE<sup><a href="#n5">5</a></sup>, Abraham could not have referenced 
it in this verse.

<p><img src="../../images/int.gif"> 
<img src="../../images/inj1.gif">(1:12) <i>"Because they have turned their hearts away from me, to worship [other gods]"</i><br>
God destroys those who worship other gods.

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (1:14) <i>"That you may have an understanding of these gods, I have given you the fashion of them in the figures 
at the beginning."</i><br>
Gosh! Thanks, Abraham! (Of course, the figures are not gods as Joseph Smith says, 
but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Abraham#Facsimile_No._1">jars that contained the deceased guts</a>.)

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (1:15) <i>"And as they lifted up their hands upon me"</i><br>
Just at the last second, God and an angel saved Abraham from being killed by those nasty Egyptians!

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (1:16-19)<br> <i>"And his voice was unto me: Abraham, Abraham, ..."</i><br>
And then Jehovah makes a little speech.

<p><img src="../../images/cr1.gif">(1:20) <i>"The Lord ... smote the priest that he died."</i> 

<p><img src="../../images/inj1.gif"><img src="../../images/int.gif">(1:21-24) <i>"From Ham, sprang that race which preserved the curse in the land"</i><br>
All Egyptians were (are?) cursed by God because Ham saw Noah when he was drunk and naked. 
(<a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/gen/9.html#20">Genesis 9:20-25</a>)

<p><img src="../../images/sci1.gif">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif">(1:23) <i>"Egyptus, which in the Chaldean signifies Egypt, which signifies that which is forbidden"</i><br>
"Egyptus" is a Greek, not a Chaldean word, and it doesn't mean "forbidden" in any language. It wasn't used at until 1375 BCE, well after the time 
that Abraham was supposed to have lived.<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup> 

<p><img src="../../images/int.gif">
<img src="../../images/inj1.gif">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif">(1:26-27) <br><i>"Pharaoh being of that lineage by which he could not have the right of Priesthood"</i><br>
The Pharaoh was black (according to this verse, anyway), and because of that he was banned from the priesthood. (Poor Pharaoh couldn't be a Mormon 
priest, since all black men were denied the Mormon priesthood until 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacks_and_The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints#Modern_LDS_Church">the 1978 revelation</a>.)  

<p><img src="../../images/sci1.gif"> (1:31) <i>"God preserved ... a knowledge of the beginning of the creation, and also of the planets, and of the stars"</i><br>
Oh boy! Abraham is going to tell us about astronomy. I can hardly wait.

<tr><td><b><a name="1">1:1</a></b> <span class="sci">In the land of the Chaldeans</span>, at the residence of my fathers, <span class="a">I, Abraham</span>, saw that it was 
needful for me to obtain another place of residence;

<tr><td><b><a name="2">1:2</a></b> <span class="a">And, finding there was greater happiness and peace and rest for me, I sought for the 
blessings of the fathers, and the right whereunto I should be ordained to administer the same; having been myself 
a follower of righteousness, desiring also to be one who possessed great knowledge, and to be a greater follower 
of righteousness, and to possess a greater knowledge</span>, and to be a father of many nations, a prince of peace, and 
desiring to receive instructions, and to keep the commandments of God, I became a rightful heir, a High Priest, 
holding the right belonging to the fathers.

<tr><td><b><a name="3">1:3</a></b> It was conferred upon me from the fathers; <span class="a">it came down from the fathers, from the 
beginning of time, yea, even from the beginning, or before the foundation of the earth, down to the present time, 
even the right of the firstborn, or the first man, who is Adam</span>, or first father, through the fathers unto me.

<tr><td><b><a name="4">1:4</a></b> I sought for mine appointment unto the Priesthood according to the appointment of God unto the fathers <span class="a">concerning 
the seed.</span>

<tr><td><b><a name="5">1:5</a></b> <span class="interp">My fathers having turned from</span> their righteousness, and from <span class="interp">the holy 
commandments which the Lord their God had given unto them</span>, unto the worshiping of the gods of the heathen, utterly refused to hearken to 
my voice;

<tr><td><b><a name="6">1:6</a></b> <span class="int">For their hearts were set to do evil, and were wholly turned to the god of Elkenah, and the god of Libnah, 
and the god of Mahmackrah, and the god of Korash, and the god of </span><span class="sci">Pharaoh, king of Egypt</span>;</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="7">1:7</a></b> <span class="a">Therefore they turned their hearts to the sacrifice of the heathen in offering up their children 
unto these dumb idols, and hearkened not unto my voice, but endeavored to take away my life by the hand of the priest of Elkenah.</span> The priest 
of 	<span class="sci">Elkenah</span> was also the priest of <span class="sci">Pharaoh</span>.

<tr><td><b><a name="8">1:8</a></b> Now, at this time it was the custom of the priest of <span class="sci">Pharaoh</span>, the king of Egypt, to offer up upon the altar which was 
built in the land of Chaldea, <span class="sci">for the offering unto these strange gods, men, women, and children</span>.


<tr><td><b><a name="9">1:9</a> </b><span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the priest made an offering unto the god of <span class="sci">Pharaoh</span>, and also unto the god of Shagreel, 
even after the manner of the Egyptians. <span class="sci">Now the god of Shagreel was the sun.</span>

<tr><td><b><a name="10">1:10</a></b> Even the thank-offering of a child did the priest of 
	<span class="sci">Pharaoh</span> offer upon the altar which stood by the hill called
	<span class="sci">Potiphar's Hill</span>, at the head of the plain of Olishem.

<tr><td><a name="11"><b>1:11</b></a> Now, this priest had offered upon this altar three virgins at one time, who were the daughters of Onitah, one of the 
royal <span class="int">descent directly from the loins of Ham</span>. These virgins were offered up because of their virtue; they would not bow down to worship gods 
of wood or of stone, therefore they were killed upon this altar, and it was done after the manner of the Egyptians.

<tr><td><a name="12"><b>1:12</b></a> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the priests laid violence upon me, that they might slay me also, as they did those virgins upon 
this altar; and that you may have a knowledge of this altar, <span class="sci">I will refer you to the representation at the commencement of this 
record.</span>

<tr><td><a name="13"><b>1:13</b></a> It was made after the form of a bedstead, such as was had among the <span class="sci">Chaldeans</span>, and it stood before the gods of 
<span class="sci">Elkenah, 
Libnah, Mahmackrah, Korash</span>, and also a god like unto that of <span class="sci">Pharaoh</span>, king of Egypt.

<tr><td><b><a name="14">1:14</a> </b> <span class="a">That you may have an understanding of these gods, I have given you the fashion of them in the figures 
at the beginning</span>, 
which manner of figures is called by the <span class="sci">Chaldeans</span> Rahleenos, which signifies hieroglyphics.

<tr><td><b><a name="15">1:15</a></b> <span class="a">And as they lifted up their hands upon me</span>, that they might offer me up and take away my life, behold, I lifted up my 
voice unto the Lord my God, and the Lord hearkened and heard, and he filled me with the vision of the Almighty, and the angel of his presence 
stood by me, and immediately unloosed my bands;

<tr><td><b><a name="16">1:16</a></b> <span class="a">And his voice was unto me: Abraham, Abraham,</span> behold, my name is Jehovah, and I have heard thee, and have come down to 
deliver thee, and to take thee away from thy father's house, and from all thy kinsfolk, into a strange land which thou knowest not of;

<tr><td><b><a name="17">1:17</a></b> And this <span class="int">because they have turned their hearts away from me, to worship the god of Elkenah, and the god of Libnah,
 and the god of Mahmackrah, and the god of Korash, and the god of Pharaoh, king of Egypt; therefore I have come down to visit them, and to 
 destroy him</span> who hath lifted up his hand against thee, Abraham, my son, to take away thy life.
 
<tr><td><b><a name="18">1:18</a></b> Behold, I will lead thee by my hand, and I will take thee, to put upon thee my name, even the Priesthood of thy father, 
and my power shall be over thee.

<tr><td><b><a name="19">1:19</a></b> As it was with Noah so shall it be with thee; but through thy ministry my name shall be known in the earth forever, 
for I am thy God.

<tr><td><b><a name="20">1:20</a></b> Behold, <span class="sci">Potiphar's Hill</span> was in <span class="sci">the land of Ur</span>, of 
<span class="sci">Chaldea</span>. And <span class="i">the Lord broke down the altar 
of </span><span class="sci">Elkenah</span>, <span class="int">and of the gods of the land, and utterly destroyed them, and</span> 
<span class="v">smote the priest that he died;</span> and there was great mourning in 
	<span class="sci">Chaldea</span>, 
and also in the court of<span class="sci"> Pharaoh</span>; which 
	<span class="sci">Pharaoh</span> signifies king by royal blood.

<tr><td><b><a name="21">1:21</a></b> <span class="int">Now this king of Egypt was a descendant from the loins of Ham, and was a partaker of the blood of the Canaanites 
by birth.</span>

<tr><td><b><a name="22">1:22</a></b> <span class="int">From this descent sprang all the Egyptians, and thus the blood of the Canaanites was preserved in the land.
	</span>

<tr><td><b><a name="23">1:23</a></b> <span class="int">The land of Egypt being first discovered by a woman, who was the daughter of Ham</span>, and the daughter of 
<span class="sci">Egyptus which in the Chaldean signifies Egypt, which signifies that which is forbidden</span>;

<tr><td><b><a name="24">1:24</a></b> When this woman discovered the land it was under water, who afterward settled her sons in it; and thus, 
	<span class="int">from Ham, sprang that race which preserved the curse in the land. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="25">1:25</a></b> Now the first government of Egypt was established by <span class="sci">Pharaoh</span>, the eldest son of<span class="sci"> Egyptus</span>,<span class="int"> the daughter of Ham</span>, and 
it was after the manner of the government of Ham, which was patriarchal.

<tr><td><b><a name="26">1:26</a></b> <span class="sci">Pharaoh</span>, being a righteous man, established his kingdom and judged his people wisely and justly all his days,
 seeking earnestly to imitate that order established by the fathers in the first generations, in the days of the first patriarchal reign, 
 even in the reign of Adam, and also of <span class="int">Noah,</span> his father, who blessed him with the blessings of the earth, and with the blessings of wisdom, 
 but <span class="int">cursed him as pertaining to the Priesthood.</span>
 
<tr><td><b><a name="27">1:27</a></b> Now, <span class="sci">Pharaoh</span> <span class="int">being of that lineage by which he could not have the right of 
Priesthood</span>, 
notwithstanding the <span class="sci">Pharaohs</span>
 would fain claim it from Noah, through Ham, therefore my father was led away by their idolatry; 
 
<tr><td><b><a name="28">1:28</a> </b>But I shall endeavor, hereafter, to delineate the chronology running back from myself to the beginning of the creation, 
for the records have come into my hands, which I hold unto this present time.

<tr><td><b><a name="29">1:29</a></b> Now, after the priest of <span class="sci">Elkenah</span> was smitten that he died, there came a fulfilment of those 
things which were said unto me concerning the land of <span class="sci">Chaldea</span>, that there should be a famine in the land.

<tr><td><b><a name="30">1:30</a></b> Accordingly a famine prevailed throughout all the land of 
	<span class="sci">Chaldea</span>, and my father was sorely tormented because of the famine, and he repented of the evil which he had 
	determined against me, to take away my life.
	
<tr><td><b><a name="31">1:31</a> </b>But the records of the fathers, even the patriarchs, concerning the right of Priesthood, the Lord my 
	<span class="sci">God preserved in 
mine own hands; therefore a knowledge of the beginning of the creation, and also of the planets, and of the stars</span>, as they were made known unto the 
fathers, have I kept even unto this day, and I shall endeavor to write some of these things upon this record, for the benefit of my posterity that 
shall come after me.
