	<h3><a name="preface">Preface</a></h3> 

	<p>For nearly two billion people, the Bible is a holy book containing the revealed word of God. It is the source of their religious beliefs. 
		Yet few of those who believe in the Bible have actually read it.
		
		<p>This must seem strange to those who have never read the Bible. But anyone who has struggled through its repetitious and tiresome 
		trivia, seemingly endless genealogies, pointless stories and laws, knows that the Bible is not an easy book to read. So it is not 
		surprising that those that begin reading at Genesis seldom make it through Leviticus. And the few Bible-believers that survive to 
		the bitter end of Revelation must continually face a disturbing dilemma: their faith tells them they should read the Bible, but by 
		reading the Bible they endanger their faith.
		
		<p>When I was a Christian, I never read the Bible. Not all the way through, anyway. The problem was that I believed the Bible to 
		be the inspired and inerrant word of God, yet the more I read it, the less credible that belief became. I finally decided that 
		to protect my faith in the Bible, I'd better quit trying to read it.
		
		<p>I think most Bible-believers find themselves in that position -- although few will admit it. Not even to themselves.
		
		<p>The most popular solution to this problem is to leave the Bible reading to the clergy. The clergy then quote from the Bible in 
		their writings and sermons, and explain its meaning to the others. Extreme care is taken, of course, to quote from the parts of the 
		Bible that display the best side of God and to ignore those that don't. That this approach means that only a fraction of the Bible 
		is ever referenced is not a great problem. Because although the Bible is not a very good book, it is a very long one.
		
		<p>But if so little of the Bible is actually used, then why isn't the rest deleted? Why aren't the repetitious passages -- which 
		are often contradictory as well -- combined into single, consistent ones? Why aren't the hundreds of cruelties and absurdities 
		eliminated? Why aren't the bad parts of the "Good Book" removed?
		
		<p>Such an approach would result in a much better, but much smaller book. To make it a truly good book, though, would require 
		massive surgery, and little would remain. For nearly all passages in the Bible are objectionable in one way or another. But with 
		a little luck and much careful editing, perhaps a small pamphlet could be produced from the Bible -- one that could honestly be 
		called good.
		
		<p>Perhaps. But to the Bible-believer the entire Bible is inspired, and has God as its author. Each passage contains a message from 
		God that must not be altered or deleted. So the believer is simply stuck with the Bible. He or she has no choice but to call it good, 
		true, beautiful, and perfect. When the Bible seems otherwise, as it nearly always does, the problem lies with the believer's 
		interpretation of the Bible -- not with the Bible itself.
		
		<p>The believer's defense of the Bible is assisted by those who publish it. They are invariably believers as well, and are 
		interested in promoting and defending the Bible. They do so in many ways, but their efforts usually include at least some of 
		the following:
				<ul>
			<li>Point out consistencies between the redundant passages, while never mentioning the contradictions.</li>
			<li>Provide explanations and excuses for the absurdities, cruelties, vulgarities, and insults to women -- when they choose not to ignore them entirely.</li>
			<li>Emphasize the relative few passages that present a decent image of God.</li>
			<li>Attach footnotes to explain away any difficulties.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Millions of such Bibles are published and distributed each year by believers in their tireless and tiresome effort to propagate 
		their beliefs. Consequently, nearly everyone, whether believer or skeptic, has at least one copy in his or her possession. Among 
		these Bibles will be found many different versions, but all have one thing in common: all are believer-friendly editions that 
		support, promote, and defend the Bible.
		
		<p><i>The Skeptic's Annotated Bible</i> attempts to remedy this imbalance. It includes the entire text of the King James Version 
		of the Bible, but without the pro-Bible propaganda. Instead, passages are highlighted that are an embarrassment to the Bible-believer, 
		and the parts of the Bible that are never read in any Church, Bible study group, or Sunday School class are emphasized. For it is 
		these passages that test the claims of the Bible-believer. The contradictions and false prophecies show that the Bible is not 
		inerrant; the cruelties, injustices, and insults to women, that it is neither good nor just.
		
		<p>The SAB will help those who believe in the Bible to honestly reconsider that belief. It will help those who are unfamiliar with 
		the Bible to resist the temptation to believe. And it will help those who have already rejected the Bible defend their position.
		
		<p>It is time for us all to stop believing in, or pretending to believe in, a book that is so unworthy of belief.

		<p><sup><a name="Genesis_1_6">6</a></sup> And God said, <a href="#Genesis_1_6n">Let there be a firmament</a> in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters

		And God called the firmament Heaven. 
		And the evening and the morning were the second day. </p>
		
		<p><sup><a name="Genesis_1_9">9</a></sup> And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the

		evening and the morning were the third day. </p>
		
		<p><sup><a name="Genesis_1_14">14</a></sup> And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the

		<a href="#Genesis_1_16an">And God made

		<sup><a name="Genesis_1_21">21</a></sup> And God created great

		<sup><a name="Genesis_20_1">1</a></sup> And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar. <sup><a name="Genesis_20_2">2</a></sup> And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah. <sup><a name="Genesis_20_3">3</a></sup> But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife. <sup><a name="Genesis_20_4">4</a></sup> But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation? <sup><a name="Genesis_20_5">5</a></sup> Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this. <sup><a name="Genesis_20_6">6</a></sup> And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. <sup><a name="Genesis_20_7">7</a></sup> Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine. <sup><a name="Genesis_20_8">8</a></sup> Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid. <sup><a name="Genesis_20_9">9</a></sup> Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done. <sup><a name="Genesis_20_10">10</a></sup> And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing? <sup><a name="Genesis_20_11">11</a></sup> And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake. <sup><a name="Genesis_20_12">12</a></sup> And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. <sup><a name="Genesis_20_13">13</a></sup> And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother. <sup><a name="Genesis_20_14">14</a></sup> And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife. <sup><a name="Genesis_20_15">15</a></sup> And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee. <sup><a name="Genesis_20_16">16</a></sup> And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved. <sup><a name="Genesis_20_17">17</a></sup> So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children. <sup><a name="Genesis_20_18">18</a></sup> For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.

		<sup><a name="Genesis_21_1">1</a></sup> And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken. <sup><a name="Genesis_21_2">2</a></sup> For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. <sup><a name="Genesis_21_3">3</a></sup> And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac. <sup><a name="Genesis_21_4">4</a></sup> And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him. <sup><a name="Genesis_21_5">5</a></sup> And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him. <sup><a name="Genesis_21_6">6</a></sup> And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me. <sup><a name="Genesis_21_7">7</a></sup> And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age. <sup><a name="Genesis_21_8">8</a></sup> And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned. <sup><a name="Genesis_21_9">9</a></sup> And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking. <sup><a name="Genesis_21_10">10</a></sup> Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac. <sup><a name="Genesis_21_11">11</a></sup> And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son. <sup><a name="Genesis_21_12">12</a></sup> And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called. <sup><a name="Genesis_21_13">13</a></sup> And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed. <sup><a name="Genesis_21_14">14</a></sup> And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba. <sup><a name="Genesis_21_15">15</a></sup> And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. <sup><a name="Genesis_21_16">16</a></sup> And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child.

Therefore was the name of it called Galeed; <sup><a name="Genesis_31_49">49</a></sup> And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another. <sup><a name="Genesis_31_50">50</a></sup> If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee. <sup><a name="Genesis_31_51">51</a></sup> And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee; <sup><a name="Genesis_31_52">52</a></sup> This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm. <sup><a name="Genesis_31_53">53</a></sup> The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac. <sup><a name="Genesis_31_54">54</a></sup> Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount. <sup><a name="Genesis_31_55">55</a></sup> And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.

		<sup><a name="Genesis_32_1">1</a></sup> And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. <sup><a name="Genesis_32_2">2</a></sup> And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim. <sup><a name="Genesis_32_3">3</a></sup> And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom. <sup><a name="Genesis_32_4">4</a></sup> And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now: <sup><a name="Genesis_32_5">5</a></sup> And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight. <sup><a name="Genesis_32_6">6</a></sup> And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him. <sup><a name="Genesis_32_7">7</a></sup> Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands; <sup><a name="Genesis_32_8">8</a></sup> And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape. <sup><a name="Genesis_32_9">9</a></sup> And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee: <sup><a name="Genesis_32_10">10</a></sup> I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands. <sup><a name="Genesis_32_11">11</a></sup> Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children. <sup><a name="Genesis_32_12">12</a></sup> And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude. <sup><a name="Genesis_32_13">13</a></sup> And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother; <sup><a name="Genesis_32_14">14</a></sup> Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams, <sup><a name="Genesis_32_15">15</a></sup> Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals. <sup><a name="Genesis_32_16">16</a></sup> And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove. <sup><a name="Genesis_32_17">17</a></sup> And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee? <sup><a name="Genesis_32_18">18</a></sup> Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us. <sup><a name="Genesis_32_19">19</a></sup> And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him. <sup><a name="Genesis_32_20">20</a></sup> And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me. <sup><a name="Genesis_32_21">21</a></sup> So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company. <sup><a name="Genesis_32_22">22</a></sup> And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok. <sup><a name="Genesis_32_23">23</a></sup> And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had. <sup><a name="Genesis_32_24">24</a></sup> And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. <sup><a name="Genesis_32_25">25</a></sup> And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him. <sup><a name="Genesis_32_26">26</a></sup> And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. <sup><a name="Genesis_32_27">27</a></sup> And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. <sup><a name="Genesis_32_28">28</a></sup> And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed. <sup><a name="Genesis_32_29">29</a></sup> And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there. <sup><a name="Genesis_32_30">30</a></sup> And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved. <sup><a name="Genesis_32_31">31</a></sup> And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh. <sup><a name="Genesis_32_32">32</a></sup> Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.

Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report. <sup><a name="Genesis_37_3">3</a></sup> Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours. <sup><a name="Genesis_37_4">4</a></sup> And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him. <sup><a name="Genesis_37_5">5</a></sup> And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more. <sup><a name="Genesis_37_6">6</a></sup> And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed: <sup><a name="Genesis_37_7">7</a></sup> For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf. <sup><a name="Genesis_37_8">8</a></sup> And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words. <sup><a name="Genesis_37_9">9</a></sup> And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me. <sup><a name="Genesis_37_10">10</a></sup> And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth? <sup><a name="Genesis_37_11">11</a></sup> And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying. <sup><a name="Genesis_37_12">12</a></sup> And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem. <sup><a name="Genesis_37_13">13</a></sup> And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I. <sup><a name="Genesis_37_14">14</a></sup> And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. <sup><a name="Genesis_37_15">15</a></sup> And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou? <sup><a name="Genesis_37_16">16</a></sup> And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks. <sup><a name="Genesis_37_17">17</a></sup> And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan. <sup><a name="Genesis_37_18">18</a></sup> And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him. <sup><a name="Genesis_37_19">19</a></sup> And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh. <sup><a name="Genesis_37_20">20</a></sup> Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams. <sup><a name="Genesis_37_21">21</a></sup> And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him. <sup><a name="Genesis_37_22">22</a></sup> And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again. <sup><a name="Genesis_37_23">23</a></sup> And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him; <sup><a name="Genesis_37_24">24</a></sup> And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it. <sup><a name="Genesis_37_25">25</a></sup> And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt. <sup><a name="Genesis_37_26">26</a></sup> And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood? <sup><a name="Genesis_37_27">27</a></sup> Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content. <sup><a name="Genesis_37_28">28</a></sup> Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt. <sup><a name="Genesis_37_29">29</a></sup> And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes. <sup><a name="Genesis_37_30">30</a></sup> And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go? <sup><a name="Genesis_37_31">31</a></sup> And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood; <sup><a name="Genesis_37_32">32</a></sup> And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's coat or no. <sup><a name="Genesis_37_33">33</a></sup> And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces. <sup><a name="Genesis_37_34">34</a></sup> And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days. <sup><a name="Genesis_37_35">35</a></sup> And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him. <sup><a name="Genesis_37_36">36</a></sup> And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.

		<sup><a name="Genesis_38_1">1</a></sup> And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. <sup><a name="Genesis_38_2">2</a></sup> And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her. <sup><a name="Genesis_38_3">3</a></sup> And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er. <sup><a name="Genesis_38_4">4</a></sup> And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan. <sup><a name="Genesis_38_5">5</a></sup> And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him. <sup><a name="Genesis_38_6">6</a></sup> And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar. <sup><a name="Genesis_38_7">7</a></sup> And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him. <sup><a name="Genesis_38_8">8</a></sup> And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother. <sup><a name="Genesis_38_9">9</a></sup> And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother. <sup><a name="Genesis_38_10">10</a></sup> And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also. <sup><a name="Genesis_38_11">11</a></sup> Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house. <sup><a name="Genesis_38_12">12</a></sup> And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. <sup><a name="Genesis_38_13">13</a></sup> And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep. <sup><a name="Genesis_38_14">14</a></sup> And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife. <sup><a name="Genesis_38_15">15</a></sup> When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face. <sup><a name="Genesis_38_16">16</a></sup> And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me? <sup><a name="Genesis_38_17">17</a></sup> And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it? <sup><a name="Genesis_38_18">18</a></sup> And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him. <sup><a name="Genesis_38_19">19</a></sup> And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood. <sup><a name="Genesis_38_20">20</a></sup> And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not. <sup><a name="Genesis_38_21">21</a></sup> Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place. <sup><a name="Genesis_38_22">22</a></sup> And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place. <sup><a name="Genesis_38_23">23</a></sup> And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her. <sup><a name="Genesis_38_24">24</a></sup> And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt. <sup><a name="Genesis_38_25">25</a></sup> When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff. <sup><a name="Genesis_38_26">26</a></sup> And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more. <sup><a name="Genesis_38_27">27</a></sup> And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb. <sup><a name="Genesis_38_28">28</a></sup> And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first. <sup><a name="Genesis_38_29">29</a></sup> And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez. <sup><a name="Genesis_38_30">30</a></sup> And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.

		<sup><a name="Genesis_39_1">1</a></sup> And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither. <sup><a name="Genesis_39_2">2</a></sup> And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian. <sup><a name="Genesis_39_3">3</a></sup> And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand. <sup><a name="Genesis_39_4">4</a></sup> And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand. <sup><a name="Genesis_39_5">5</a></sup> And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field. <sup><a name="Genesis_39_6">6</a></sup> And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat.

And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you. <sup><a name="Genesis_40_9">9</a></sup> And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me; <sup><a name="Genesis_40_10">10</a></sup> And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes: <sup><a name="Genesis_40_11">11</a></sup> And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand. <sup><a name="Genesis_40_12">12</a></sup> And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days: <sup><a name="Genesis_40_13">13</a></sup> Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler. <sup><a name="Genesis_40_14">14</a></sup> But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house: <sup><a name="Genesis_40_15">15</a></sup> For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon. <sup><a name="Genesis_40_16">16</a></sup> When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head: <sup><a name="Genesis_40_17">17</a></sup> And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head. <sup><a name="Genesis_40_18">18</a></sup> And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days: <sup><a name="Genesis_40_19">19</a></sup> Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee. <sup><a name="Genesis_40_20">20</a></sup> And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants. <sup><a name="Genesis_40_21">21</a></sup> And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand: <sup><a name="Genesis_40_22">22</a></sup> But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them. <sup><a name="Genesis_40_23">23</a></sup> Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.

So I awoke. <sup><a name="Genesis_41_22">22</a></sup> And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good: <sup><a name="Genesis_41_23">23</a></sup> And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them: <sup><a name="Genesis_41_24">24</a></sup> And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me. <sup><a name="Genesis_41_25">25</a></sup> And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do. <sup><a name="Genesis_41_26">26</a></sup> The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one. <sup><a name="Genesis_41_27">27</a></sup> And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine. <sup><a name="Genesis_41_28">28</a></sup> This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh. <sup><a name="Genesis_41_29">29</a></sup> Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt: <sup><a name="Genesis_41_30">30</a></sup> And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land; <sup><a name="Genesis_41_31">31</a></sup> And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous. <sup><a name="Genesis_41_32">32</a></sup> And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass. <sup><a name="Genesis_41_33">33</a></sup> Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. <sup><a name="Genesis_41_34">34</a></sup> Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years. <sup><a name="Genesis_41_35">35</a></sup> And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities. <sup><a name="Genesis_41_36">36</a></sup> And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine. <sup><a name="Genesis_41_37">37</a></sup> And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants. <sup><a name="Genesis_41_38">38</a></sup> And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is? <sup><a name="Genesis_41_39">39</a></sup> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art: <sup><a name="Genesis_41_40">40</a></sup> Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou. <sup><a name="Genesis_41_41">41</a></sup> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt. <sup><a name="Genesis_41_42">42</a></sup> And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck; <sup><a name="Genesis_41_43">43</a></sup> And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt. <sup><a name="Genesis_41_44">44</a></sup> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt. <sup><a name="Genesis_41_45">45</a></sup> And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt. <sup><a name="Genesis_41_46">46</a></sup> And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt. <sup><a name="Genesis_41_47">47</a></sup> And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls. <sup><a name="Genesis_41_48">48</a></sup> And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same. <sup><a name="Genesis_41_49">49</a></sup> And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number. <sup><a name="Genesis_41_50">50</a></sup> And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bare unto him. <sup><a name="Genesis_41_51">51</a></sup> And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house. <sup><a name="Genesis_41_52">52</a></sup> And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction. <sup><a name="Genesis_41_53">53</a></sup> And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended. <sup><a name="Genesis_41_54">54</a></sup> And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. <sup><a name="Genesis_41_55">55</a></sup> And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do. <sup><a name="Genesis_41_56">56</a></sup> And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt. <sup><a name="Genesis_41_57">57</a></sup> And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands.

<h3><a name="notes"></a>Notes</h3>
<h4><a name="Genesis_notes"></a>Genesis</h4>

<a name="Genesis_1_1n"></a> (<a href="#Genesis_1_1">1:1-2:3</a>) <i>"In the beginning"</i><br>
The first of two contradictory creation accounts. Compare with <a href="#Genesis__2_4">Genesis 2:4-25</a> in which the order of events is entirely 
different.

<p>The creation account in <a href="#Genesis_1">Genesis 1</a> conflicts with the order of events that are known to science. 

<p>In <a href="#Genesis_1">Genesis 1:1</a>, the earth and "heaven" are created together "in the beginning" around 6000 years ago, whereas according to current estimates, 
the earth and universe are about 4.6 and 13.7 billion years old, respectively. 

<p>In Genesis, the earth is 
created (<a href="#Genesis_1_1">1:1</a>) before light (<a href="#Genesis_1_3">1:3</a>), sun and stars (<a href="#Genesis_1_16">1:16</a>); birds and 
whales (<a href="#Genesis_1_21">1:21</a>) before reptiles and insects (<a href="#Genesis_1_24">1:24</a>); and flowering plants 
(<a href="#Genesis_1_11">1:11</a>) before any animals (<a href="#Genesis_1_20">1:20</a>). The order of events known from science is 
in each case just the opposite.

<p>Although the Bible's begats do not provide a clear creation date (though many believers believe that they do), they do provide a range 
of possible dates. The universe (if you believe in the Bible) is 5500 to 7500 years old. So right from the start the Bible is wrong. The 
universe is about 2 million times older than the Bible says it is.

<p><a name="Genesis_1_2n"></a> (<a href="#Genesis_1_2">1:2</a>)<i> "The earth was without form"</i><br>
Some Christians believe there was a long gap (perhaps as long as 4.6 billion years) between the first two verses of Genesis. During this time there 
was a war in heaven, demons were cast down to earth, and nature was corrupted through demonic activity.

<p>This interpretation addresses two problems caused by modern science: the age of the earth and the nature of nature. A straightforward 
reading of Genesis indicates that the earth is only about 6000 years old, not the 4.6 billion that science has found it to be. And disease, 
suffering, death, predators, and parasites are found throughout the living world, yet all were supposedly created by a kind and loving God. 
The gap theory allows Mother Nature to be both old and nasty, without casting blame on either God or the Bible.

<p>Needless to say, the gap theory is controversial among Bible-believers. 

<p><a name="Genesis_1_3n"></a> (<a href="#Genesis_1_3">1:3-5</a>, <a href="#Genesis_1_14">14-19</a>) <i>"Let there be light"</i><br>
God creates light and separates light from darkness, and day from night, on the first day. Yet he didn't make the light producing objects (the sun 
and the stars) until the fourth day (<a href="#Genesis_1_14">1:14-19</a>). And how could there be "the evening and the morning" on the first day if there 
was no sun to mark them?

<p><a name="Genesis_1_6n"></a> (<a href="#Genesis_1_6">1:6-8</a>) <i>"Let the be a firmament"</i><br>
God spends one-sixth of his entire creative effort (the second day) working on a solid firmament. This strange structure, which God calls heaven, 
is intended to separate the higher waters from the lower waters.

<p><a name="Genesis_1_11n"></a> (<a href="#Genesis_1_11">1:11</a>) <i>"Let the earth bring forth grass"</i><br>
Plants are made on the third day before there was a sun to drive their photosynthetic processes (<a href="#Genesis_1_14">1:14-19</a>). Notice, though, that God lets 
"the earth bring forth" the plants, rather than creating them directly. <br>
<a href="#evolution">Does the Bible teach evolution?</a><br>
<a href="#plants">Were plants created before or after humans?</a>

<p><a name="Genesis_1_14n"></a> (<a href="#Genesis_1_14">1:14</a>) <i>"Let them be for signs"</i><br>
God placed the sun, moon, and stars in the firmament so that they can be used "for signs". This, of course, is exactly what astrologers do: read "the 
signs" in the Zodiac to predict what will happen on Earth.<br>
<a href="#astrology">Does the Bible condemn astrology?</a>

<p><a name="Genesis_1_16an"></a> (<a href="#Genesis_1_16">1:16</a>) <i>"And God made two great lights."</i><br>
But the moon is not a light; it only reflects light from the sun. And why, if God made the moon to "rule the night," does it spend half of its time 
moving through the daytime sky?

<p><a name="Genesis_1_16bn"></a> (<a href="#Genesis_1_16">1:16</a>) <i>"He made the stars also."</i><br>
God spends a day making light (before making the sun and stars) and separating light from darkness; then, at the end of a hard day's work, and almost 
as an afterthought, he makes the trillions of stars.<br>
<a href="#stars">When were the stars made?</a>

<p><a name="Genesis_1_17n"></a> (<a href="#Genesis_1_17">1:17</a>) <i>"And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon 
the earth."</i><br> 
Then why is only a tiny fraction of stars visible from earth? Under the best conditions, no more than a few thousand stars are visible with the unaided eye, yet there are 
a hundred billion stars in our galaxy and a hundred billion or so galaxies. Were they all created "to give light upon the earth"?

 <p><a name="Genesis_1_25n"></a> (<a href="#Genesis_1_25">1:25</a>)<i>"And God made the beast of the earth" </i><br>
 The Christian Identity and Aryan Nations folks say that "beast of the earth" and "beast of the field" refer to all non-human animals and 
non-white humans. They consider all people of color to be without a soul and on the same level as animals, such as cattle, fish, and birds.<br>
<a href="#adam_first">Were humans created before the other animals?</a>

<p><a name="Genesis_1_26bn"></a> (<a href="#Genesis_1_26">1:26</a>) <i>"Let them have dominion ... over all the earth."</i><br>
God gave humans dominion over every other living thing on earth. This couldn't be true, of course, since millions of other species existed for 
millions of years before humans existed. But this verse is used by fundamentalist Christians to justify their mistreatment of other species and 
disregard for the environment. After all, they believe that God created the other species just for them, so they can do whatever they please with 
them.

<p><a name="Genesis_1_29n"></a> (<a href="#Genesis_1_29">1:29</a>) <i>"I have given you every herb."</i><br>
Since many plants have evolved poisons to protect against animals that would like to eat them, God's advice is more than a little reckless. Would 
you tell your children to go out in the garden and eat whatever plants they encounter? Of course not. But then, you are much nicer and smarter 
than God.<br>

 <p><a name="Genesis_1_30n"></a> (<a href="#Genesis_1_30">1:30</a>) <i>"To every beast ... I have given every green herb for meat."</i><br>
 All animals were originally herbivores. Tapeworms, vampire bats, mosquitoes, and barracudas -- all were strict vegetarians, as created by God. 
 
 <p><a name="Genesis_1_31an"></a> (<a href="#Genesis_1_31">1:31</a>) <i>"It was very good." </i><br>
 God purposefully designed a system that ensures the suffering and death of all his creatures, parasite and host, predator and prey.
 
 <p><a name="Genesis_1_31bn"></a> (<a href="#Genesis_1_31">1:31</a>)
 <i>"The sixth day.</i><br>
In Genesis 1 the entire creation takes 6 days, but the universe is about 13.7 billion years old, with new stars constantly being formed. 

<p><a name="Genesis_2_2n"></a> (<a href="#Genesis_2_2">2:2</a>) <i>"He rested."</i><br>
Even God gets tired sometimes.

<p><a name="Genesis_2_4n"></a> (<a href="#Genesis_2_4">2:4-25</a>) <i>"These are the generations"</i>
<br>
The second creation account. Compare with <a href="#Genesis_1_1">Genesis 1:1-2:3</a> in which the order of events is entirely different.

<p><a name="Genesis_2_5n"></a> (<a href="#Genesis_2_5">2:5</a>) <i>"Every plant of the field before it was in the earth"</i><br>
In <a href="#Genesis_1_1">chapter 1</a> plants are created on the third day before humans are created on the sixth. But in 
<a href="#Genesis_2_2">chapter 2</a> the order is reversed. 

<p><a name="Genesis_2_7n"></a> (<a href="#Genesis_2_7">2:7</a>) <i>"The LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground."</i><br>
<a href="#plants">When were plants created?</a>

<p><a name="Genesis_2_9n"></a> (<a href="#Genesis_2_9">2:9</a>) <i>"The tree of life ... and the tree of knowledge of good and evil."</i><br>
God created two magic trees: the tree of life and the tree of knowledge. Eat from the the first, and you live forever 
(<a href="#Genesis_3_22">3:22</a>); eat from the second and you'll die the same day (<a href="#Genesis_2_17">2:17</a>). (Or that's what God 
said, anyway. Adam ate from the tree of knowledge and lived for another 930 years or so (<a href="#Genesis_5_5">5:5</a>). But he never got a 
change to eat from the tree of life. God prevented him from eating from the tree of life before Adam could eat 
from the tree, become a god, and live forever.)

<p><a name="Genesis_2_15n"></a> (<a href="#Genesis_2_15">2:15</a>) <i>"To dress and keep it"</i><br>
Some believers claim that this verse requires them to be environmentalists.

<p><a name="Genesis_2_17n"></a> (<a href="#Genesis_2_17">2:17</a>) <i>"In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."</i><br>
God says that if Adam eats from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, then the day that he does so, he will die. But later Adam eats the forbidden fruit (<a href="#Genesis_3_6">3:6</a>) and yet 
lives for another 930 years (<a href="#Genesis_5_5">5:5</a>).<br>

<blockquote>God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; 
  male and female created he them. <A href="#Genesis_1_27">Genesis 1:27</A>
</blockquote>

<p><i>After Adam and all the animals were created.</i>

<blockquote>And Adam gave names to  all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every 
  beast of the field; but for Adam there was not  found an help meet for him. And the LORD God 
  caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up 
  the flesh instead thereof; And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, 
  and brought her unto the man. <A href="#Genesis_2_20">Genesis 2:20-22</A>

<h4><a name="fowl">From what were the fowls created?</a></h4>

<p><i>From the waters.</i>

<blockquote>
And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving 
        creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in 
        the open firmament of heaven. And God created great whales, and every 
        living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, 
        after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw 
        that it was good. <A href="#Genesis_1_20">Genesis 1:20-21</A>

</blockquote>

<p><i>From the ground.</i>

<blockquote>And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and
     every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call
     them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name
     thereof. <A href="#Genesis_2_19">Genesis 2:19</A>

<p>God gave us every plant for food. What about <i>Canabis sativa</i>? Is it okay to eat (or smoke) that 
plant? 

How about the opium poppy (<i>Papaver somniferum</i>), coca plant (<i>Erythroxylum 
coca</i>), or the peyote cactus (<i>Lophophora williamsii</i>)? Did God give us 
these plants to eat too? It would seem that he did, since there are no 
exceptions given in <a href="#Genesis_1_19">Genesis 1:29</a>.<hr>


<h4><a name="adam_created">When was Adam created?</a></h4>

<p>4026 BCE, according to the Jehovah's Witnesses.

<p>"According to reliable Bible chronology Adam was created in the year 4026 B.C.E., likely in the autumn of
the year, at the end of the sixth day of creation." (April 1, 1968, Watchtower) This was 
the basis of the failed 1975 prophecy: that Armageddon would occur in 1975, 6000 
years after Adam's creation. The failure of the &quot;reliable Bible
chronology&quot; was never explained, and the whole 6000 years thing was promptly dropped and forgotten after 1975 passed uneventfully.

     <li>Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators,
     stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee.
     Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame:
     there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it. <A href="#Isaiah_47_13">Isaiah 47:13-14</A>

     
     <li>Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of

 kind: and it was so. <a href="#Genesis_1_24">Genesis 1:24</a>

<h3><a name="pre-adamites">The Pre-Adamites</a></h3> 

One way of dealing with the two contradictory creation 
accounts is to say that the reason there are two different stories is that there were two different 
creations. This has been a common interpretation historically, and it is still found taday. 

<p>It does solve a few problems. It explains, for example:
<ul>
<li>Why there are two contradictory creation accounts.
<p><li>Where Cain found his wife and found enough people to build a city. 
(<a href="#Genesis_4_12">Genesis 4:12-17</a>) 
<p><li>The origin of native Americans, Australians, Polynesians, etc.
<p><li>Why the first account doesn't mention Adam or Eve.
</ul>

<p>But Pre-Adamite theology has also been used to support racisim and antisemitism.
