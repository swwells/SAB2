<p><li>The prophecy given in <A
href="../is/7.html#14">Isaiah 7:14</A> referred not to a virgin but to a young
woman, living at the time of the prophecy. And Jesus, of course, was called
Jesus -- and is not called Emmanuel in any verse in the New Testament. <a href="1.html#23">1:23</a>

<p><li>Matthew claims that Jesus' birth in Bethlehem
fulfils the prophecy in <A href="../mic/5.html#2">Micah 5:2</A>. But this is
unlikely for two reasons.
<uL>
  <li>&quot;Bethlehem Ephratah&quot; in Micah 5:2 refers not to a town, but to a
    clan: the clan of Bethlehem, who was the son of Caleb's second wife,
    Ephrathah (<A href="../1chr/2.html#18">1 Chr 2:18</A>, <A
    href="../1chr/2.html#50">2:50-52</A>, <A href="../1chr/4.html#4">4:4</A>).
    
  <li>The prophecy (if that is what it is) does not refer to the Messiah, but
    rather to a military leader, as can be seen from <A href="../mic/5.html#6">Micah
    5:6</A>. This leader is supposed to defeat the Assyrians, which, of course,
    Jesus never did.
</uL>
It should also be noted that Matthew altered the text of Micah 5:2 by saying:
&quot;And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda&quot; rather than &quot;Bethlehem
Ephratah&quot; as is said in Micah 5:2. He did this, intentionally no doubt, to
make the verse appear to refer to the town of Bethlehem rather than the family
clan. <a href="2.html#5">2:5-6</a>

<p><li> &quot;Out of Egypt I have called my son,&quot;<BR>
Matthew claims that the flight of Jesus' family to Egypt is a fulfillment of <A
href="../hos/11.html#1">Hosea 11:1</A>. But Hosea 11:1 is not a prophecy at all,
as is clear when the entire verse is quoted (&quot;When Israel was a child, then
I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.&quot;). It is a reference to the
Hebrew exodus from Egypt and has nothing to do with Jesus. Matthew tries to hide
this fact by quoting only the last part of the verse. <a href="2.html#15">2:15</a>

<p><li>Matthew quotes <A href="../jer/31.html#15">Jeremiah
31:15</A>, claiming that it was a prophecy of King Herod's alleged slaughter of
the children in and around Bethlehem after the birth of Jesus. But this verse
refers to the Babylonian captivity, as is clear by reading the next two verses
(16 and 17), and, thus, has nothing to do with Herod's massacre. <a href="2.html#17">2:17-18</a>

<p><li>&quot;He shall be called a Nazarene.&quot;
Matthew claims this was a fulfillment of prophecy, yet such a prophecy is not
found anywhere in the Old Testament. <a href="2.html#23">2:23</a>

<p><li>The devil correctly quotes scripture (<A
href="../ps/91.html#11">Ps 91:11-12</A>), while Jesus misquotes Deuteronomy by
adding &quot;only&quot; to <A href="../dt/6.html#13">Dt 6:13</A>. <a href="4.html#6">4:6, 10</a>

<p><li>Families will be torn apart because of Jesus (this is one of the few "prophecies" in the Bible that has actually come
true). "Brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents,
and cause them to be put to death."  <a href="10.html#21">10:21</a>

<p><li>Jesus tells his disciples that he will return before they can "go over the cities of Israel." Later (<a href="24.html#14">24:14</a>) 
he says he will not come until the gospel is preached throughout the world. Well, his disciples went over the cities of Israel and then died
waiting for the "return of the Lord." Now, nearly 2000 years later, and long after the gospel had been preached throughout the
world, his followers still wait. <a href="10.html#23">10:23</a>

<p><li>When Jesus and his disciples are accused of breaking the Sabbath, he excuses himself by referring to a scripture in
which priests who "profaned the Sabbath" were blameless. But there is no such passage in the Old Testament.

<a href="13.html#35">13:35</a>

<p><li>Jesus visits Tyre which according to Ezekiel
(<A href="../ezek/26.html#14">26:14, 21</A>; <A href="../ezek/27.html#36">27:36</A>,
<A href="../ezek/28.html#19">28:19</A>) was not supposed to exist. <a href="15.html#21">15:21</a>

<p><li>Jesus mistakenly tells his followers that he will return and establish his kingdom within their lifetime. 
 <a href="16.html#28">16:28</a>
 
<p><li>This verse claims that Jesus fulfils the prophecy in <A href="../zech/9.html#9">Zechariah 9:9</A>. 
But this cannot be since the person referred to in Zechariah (see verses 
<A href="../zech/9.html#10">10-13</A>) was both a military leader and the king of an earthly kingdom.
 <a href="21.html#4">21:4</a>
 
<p><li>Jesus predicts the end of the world within the lifetime of his listeners.  <a href="23.html#36">23:36</a>

<p><li>The end of the world will be signaled by wars, famines, disease, and earthquakes (6-7). And that's just 
    "the beginning of sorrows" (8). Next believers will be hated and killed by unbelievers (9), believers will hate and betray each other (10), false 
    prophets will fool people (11), iniquity will abound and love wax cold (12). But hey, if you make through all that, you'll be saved (13).  
    
    <p>Only one more thing will happen before the end comes: the gospel will be preached throughout the world (14). Well, that and the abomination 
    of desolations will stand in the holy place (15), many false Christs and false prophets will show great signs and wonders (24), the sun and moon 
    will be darkened and the stars will fall (29), the sign of the son of Man will appear in the sky, everyone on earth will mourn, and then, 
    finally, the great and powerful son of Man will come in all his glory (30).
    
    <p>Oh, and all these things will happen within the lifespan of Jesus' contemporaries (34).
    
    <p>Or maybe not. Jesus was talking about things he knew nothing about (36). (See <a href="../mk/13.html#32">Mark 13:32</a>.)
  <a href="24.html#3">24:3-51</a>
    
<p><li>Jesus says the gospel will be preached to all nations &quot;and then shall the end come. Well according 
to Paul the gospel has been preached to everyone (<a href="../rom/10.html#18">Rom.10:18</a>) yet the 
end hasn't come. <a href="24.html#14">24:14</a>

<p><li>Jesus is a false prophet, since he predicts
that the end of the world will come within the lifetimes of his disciples. The world of course didn't end </A>then, and
according to <A href="../ec/1.html#4">Ec.1:4</A> it never will end. <a href="24.html#34">24:34</a>

<p><li>"But all this was done, that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled." What scriptures? What prophets?
There is no such prophecy in the Old Testament.  <a href="26.html#5">26:56</a>

<p><li>Jesus falsely prophesies that the high priest would see his second coming.  <a href="26.html#64">26:64</a>

<p><li>This is not a quote from Jeremiah, but a misquote of Zechariah (<A
href="../zech/11.html#12">11:12-13</A>). <a href="27.html#9">27:9</a>
