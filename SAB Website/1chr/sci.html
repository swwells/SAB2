<p><li>Some creationists believe that this verse (and <a href="../gen/10.html#25">Genesis 10:25</a>) refers to 
continental drift, which, they say, began to occur during the days of Pelag (which means "division"), 
about 100 or so years after the flood. <a href="1.html#19">1:19</a>

<!--<p><li>Among those killed by the "mighty man", Benaiah, was a 
<a href="../topics/giants.html">giant</a> Egyptian "five cubits high". 
Since a cubit is 18 inches or so, that would have made him about 7'6" (2.3 meters).  
<a href="11.html#23">11:23</a>-->

<p><li>"The earth ... shall be stable, that it be not moved." It doesn't spin on its axis or 
travel about the sun.  <a href="16.html#30">16:30</a>

<p><li>According to this verse David's army had 1,100,000 men from Israel and 470,000 men from Judah, 
Of course, this numbers is ridiculously high for a battle between two tribal armies in 1000 BCE. 
(The United States had about <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/almanac/almanac/at_a_glance.html">1.37 
million</a> active duty soldiers in 2001.) <a href="21.html#5">21:5</a>

<p><li>David provides Solomon with a fantastically large amount of gold and 
silver with which to build the temple: 100,000 talents of gold and 1,000,000 talents of silver. Since a 
talent was about 60 pounds, this would be about 3,000 tons of gold and 30,000 tons of silver.

<p><li>King David collects ten thousand drams (or
darics) for the construction of the temple in Jerusalem. This is especially interesting since darics 
were coins named after King Darius I who lived some five hundred years after David.
 <a href="29.html#7">29:7</a>
 
<p><li>As usual, the reported amounts of gold, silver, and iron are grossly exaggerated. (5000 talents 
of gold, for example, would be about 150,000 kilograms, which would be worth about 4.2 billion US dollars in today's market.)
