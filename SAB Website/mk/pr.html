<p><li>Mark claims that John the Baptist fulfilled the prophecy given in Malachi 
(<a href="../mal/3.html#1">3:1</a>, <a href="../mal/4.html#1">4:1, 5</a>). But the Malachi prophecy says that God 
will send Elijah before "the great and dreadful day of the LORD" in which the world will be consumed by fire. Yet John the 
Baptist flatly denied that he was Elijah (Elias) in <a href="../jn/1.html#21">John 1:21</a> and the earth was not destroyed after 
John's appearance.  <a href="1.html#2">1:2</a>

<p><li>Ezekiel (<A href="../ezek/26.html#14">26:14,
21</A>, <A href="../ezek/27.html#36">27:36</A>) prophesied that Tyre would be
completely destroyed, never to be built again. But it wasn't destroyed and
continued to exist, as shown by this verse in which Jesus visits Tyre. <a href="7.html#24">7:24, 31</a>
<p><li> Jesus falsely prophesies that the end of the world will come within his listeners' lifetimes. 
 <a href="9.html#1">9:1</a>
 
<p><li>Jesus shows that he is a false prophet by predicting his return and the end of the world within the lifetime of his
listeners.  <a href="13.html#30">13:30</a>

<p><li>Jesus falsely prophesies that the high priest would see his second coming.  <a href="14.html#62">14:62</a>
