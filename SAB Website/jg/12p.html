<img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (12:1) After Jephthah finished burning his daughter for God to pay God back for helping him slaughter twenty Ammonite cities, he ran into some Ephraimites who were 
angry about being left out of the Ammonite slaughter. They were so pissed off about the whole thing that they threatened to burn down Jephthah's house. 

<p>(12:1) <i>"The men of Ephraim ... said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of 
Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire."</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (12:2-4) Jephthah claimed that he invited them to join him in the God-assisted slaughter, but they didn't come. 
Clearly, there was only one thing for Jephthah to do: call for a holy 
civil war. So that's what he did, and the men from Gilead defeated the Epharimites.

<p>(12:2) <i>"Jephthah said ... I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands."</i>

<p>(12:3) <i>"And the LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?"</i>

<p>(12:4) <i>"Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim."</i>

After the battle, Jephthah posted guards at the Jordan River where the fleeing Ephraimites would have to cross. 
When an Ephraimite came to the crossing, the Gileadites would ask him if he was an Ephraimite. If he said, "No", they'd ask him to say "Shibboleth" (Ephraimites couldn't pronounce it correctly. It was like asking George W. Bush or Sarah Palin to 
say "nuclear.") Then when the lying Ephraimite mispronounced Shibboleth by 
saying Siboleth, they'd kill him.

<p>And the shibboleth test worked like a charm. 42,000 Ephraimites failed the test and were killed trying to cross the Jordan.<br>

<p>(12:5) <i>"When those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay."</i> 

<p>(12:6) <i>"Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew 
him ... and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand."</i>
