<img src="../../images/plag.gif"  > (18:1-22) More Isaiah (<a href="../../is/8.html">Chapter 8</a>)

<p>(18:1)Moreover the LORD said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and write in it
    with a man's pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz. 
    
<p>(18:2) And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and
    Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.

<p>(18:3) And I went unto the prophetess; and she
    conceived, and bare a son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name
    Mahershalalhashbaz.
    
<p><img src="../../images/sex1.gif" >
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (18:3) Isaiah has sex with a prophetess (Why is Joseph Smith telling us about this?) 
who conceivesand bears a son. (You weren't expecting a daughter, were you?) God then tells
Isaiah to call his name Mathershalalhashbaz. (It has a nice ring to it, doesn't
it?)

<p>(18:4) For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my
    mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away
    before the king of Assyria.

<br>(18:5) The LORD spake also unto me again, saying,

<br>(18:6) Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly,
    and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;

<br>(18:7) Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the
    river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he
    shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks:

<br>(18:8) And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall
    reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the
    breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.

<br>(18:9) Associate yourselves, O
    ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of
    far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces;
    gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces.
    
    <p><img src="../../images/inj1.gif" >
<img src="../../images/cr1.gif" > (18:9) If you associate or gird yourself, God will break you in pieces.

<p>(18:10) Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it
    shall not stand: for God is with us. 

<br>(18:11) For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I
    should not walk in the way of this people, saying,

<br>(18:12) Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A
    confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.

<br>(18:13) Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him
    be your dread.

<br>(18:14) And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a
    rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to
    the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

<br>(18:15) And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared,
    and be taken.

<p>(18:16) Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.

<p>(18:17) And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the house of
    Jacob, and I will look for him.

<p>(18:18) Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for signs and
    for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth in mount Zion.

<p>(18:19) And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar
    spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people
    seek unto their God? for the living to the dead? 

<p>(18:20) To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word,
    it is because there is no light in them.

<p>(18:21) <img src="../../images/abs1.gif" >
<a href="aictp_list.html">It shall came to pass</a> (18:21, 22)

<p>(18:21) And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it shall
    come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves,
    and curse their king and their God, and look upward.
    
<br>(18:22) And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and darkness,
    dimness of anguish; and they shall be driven to darkness.

<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>18:1</b> <span class="plag">Moreover, the word of the Lord said unto me: Take thee a great roll, and write in it 
with a man's pen, concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>18:2</b> <span class="plag">And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah 
the son of Jeberechiah.</span>

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>18:3</b> <span class="plag">And</span> <span class="s">I went unto the prophetess;</span><span class="a"> and she conceived and bare a son.  Then said the 
Lord to me: Call his name, Maher-shalal-hash-baz.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>18:4</b> <span class="plag">For behold, the child shall not have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, 
before the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of 
Assyria. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>18:5</b> <span class="plag">The Lord spake also unto me again, saying:
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>18:6</b> <span class="plag">Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and 
rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son; </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>18:7</b> <span class="plag">Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, 
strong and many, even the king of Assyria and all his glory; and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over 
all his banks. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>18:8</b> <span class="plag">And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach 
even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>18:9</b>   <span class="i">Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear 
all ye of far countries; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in 
pieces.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>18:10</b> <span class="plag">Take counsel together, and it shall come to naught; speak the word, and it shall 
not stand; for God is with us. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>18:11</b> <span class="plag">For the Lord spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should 
not walk in the way of this people, saying: </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>18:12</b> <span class="plag">Say ye not, A confederacy, to all to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; 
neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>18:13</b> <span class="plag">Sanctify the Lord of Hosts himself, and let him be your fear, and let him be your 
dread. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>18:14</b> <span class="plag">And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling, and for a rock 
of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>18:15</b> <span class="plag">And many among them shall stumble and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be 
taken. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>18:16</b> <span class="plag">Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>18:17</b> <span class="plag">And I will wait upon the Lord, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and 
I will look for him. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>18:18</b> <span class="plag">Behold, I and the children whom the Lord hath given me are for signs and for 
wonders in Israel from the Lord of Hosts, which dwelleth in Mount Zion. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>18:19</b> <span class="plag">And when they shall say unto you: Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and 
unto wizards that peep and mutter -- should not a people seek unto their God for the living to hear from the dead?
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>18:20</b> <span class="plag">To the law and to the testimony; and if they speak not according to this word, it is 
because there is no light in them. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>18:21</b> <span class="plag">And they shall pass through it hardly bestead and hungry; and
  </span> <span class="a">it shall come to 
pass</span> <span class="plag">that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look 
upward. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>18:22</b> <span class="plag">And they shall look unto the earth and behold trouble, and darkness, dimness of 
anguish, and shall be driven to darkness. </span>
