<a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif">(10:1) <i>"I, Nephi, proceed to give an account ... of my proceedings ... wherefore, 
to proceed with mine account, I must speak somewhat...."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<img src="../../images/pr1.gif">(10:2-11) Jesus said that John the Baptist was the greatest prophet who 
had ever lived.

<p><i>"For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: 
but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."</i> <a href="../../lk/7.html#28">Luke 7:28</a>

<p>But that was just because he hadn't yet read the Book of Mormon, so he didn't know about Lehi.

<p>Because when it comes to prophecy, Lehi makes Moses, Muhammad, Jesus, and John the Baptist look 
like the governing body of the Jehovah's Witnesses.

<p>Here are just some of the things that Lehi prophesied in 600 BCE.

<ol>
<li>The Babylonian captivity.

<p><i>"He spake unto them concerning the Jews -- That after they should be destroyed, even that great city Jerusalem, 
and many be carried away captive into Babylon."</i> (10:2-3)

<p><li>That a Messiah ("or, in other words, the Savior of the world") would come 600 years later.

<p><i>"Yea, even six hundred years from the time that my father left Jerusalem, a prophet would the Lord God raise up among the 
Jews -- even a Messiah, or, in other words, a Savior of the world."</i> (10:4)

<p><li> That a prophet would come before the Messiah to "prepare the way of the Lord."

<p><i>"And he spake also concerning a prophet who should come before the Messiah, to prepare the way of the Lord."</i> (10:7)

<p><li> Lehi even know the words that the King James Version translators would put in John the Baptist's mouth 2200 years later.

<p><i>"Yea, even he should go forth and cry in the wilderness: Prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight; for there 
standeth one among you whom ye know not; and he is mightier than I, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose. And much spake 
my father concerning this thing."</i> (10:8)

<p><li> He knew where John the Baptist would be baptizing. (Bethabara, beyond the Jordan)

<p><i>"And my father said he should baptize in Bethabara, beyond Jordan; and he also said he should baptize with water; even that he 
should baptize the Messiah with water. And after he had baptized the Messiah with water, he should behold and bear record that he 
had baptized the Lamb of God, who should take away the sins of the world."</i> (10:9-10)

<p><li> And that the Messiah (Lehi couldn't quite make out Jesus' name) would be killed by the Jews (who were dwindling in unbelief) 
and then rise from the dead.

<p><i>"And it came to pass after my father had spoken these words he spake unto my brethren concerning the gospel which should be 
preached among the Jews, and also concerning the dwindling of the Jews in unbelief. And after they had slain the Messiah, who should 
come, and after he had been slain he should rise from the dead, and should make himself manifest, by the Holy Ghost, unto the 
Gentiles."</i> (10:11)

</ol>

<p>So Jesus was wrong about John the Baptist. Lehi was the greatest prophet in the world."</i>

<p>(10:8) I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight

<p>(10:8) One mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose.

Messiah with water. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="10">10:10</b></a>   <span class="p">And after he had baptized the Messiah with water, he should 
behold and bear record that he had baptized </span><span class="plag">the Lamb of God, who should take away the sins 
of the world.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="11">10:11</b></a>   <span class="p">And it came to pass after my father 
had spoken these words he spake unto my brethren concerning the gospel which should be 
preached among the Jews, and also concerning the </span><span class="a">dwindling </span><span class="p">of the Jews<span><span class="a"> in unbelief</span>.  <span class="p">And 
after they had slain the Messiah, who should come, and after he had been slain he should 
rise from the dead, and should make himself manifest, by the Holy Ghost, unto the 
Gentiles. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="12">10:12</b></a>   Yea, even my father spake much concerning the Gentiles, 
and also concerning the house of Israel, that they should be compared like unto an 
olive-tree, whose branches should be broken off and should be scattered upon all the face 
of the earth. 

<tr><td><b><a name="13">10:13</b></a>   Wherefore, he said it must needs be that we 
should be led with one accord into the land of promise, unto the fulfilling of the word of 
the Lord, that we should be scattered upon all the face of the earth. 

<tr><td><b><a name="14">10:14</b></a>   And after the house of Israel should be scattered they 
should be gathered together again; or, in fine, after the Gentiles had received the fulness 
of the Gospel, the natural branches of the olive-tree, or the remnants of the house of 
Israel, should be grafted in, or come to the knowledge of the true Messiah, their Lord and 
their Redeemer. 

<tr><td><b><a name="15">10:15</b></a>   And after this manner of language did my father prophesy 
and speak unto my brethren, and also many more things which I do not write in this book; 
for I have written as many of them as were expedient for me in mine other book. 

<tr><td><b><a name="16">10:16</b></a>   And all these things, of which I have spoken, were done as 
my father dwelt in a tent, in the valley of Lemuel. 

<tr><td><b><a name="17">10:17</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> after I, 
Nephi, having heard all the words of my father, concerning the things which he saw in a 
vision, and also the things which he spake by the power of the Holy Ghost, which power he 
received by faith on the Son of God -- and the Son of God was the Messiah who should 
come -- I, Nephi, was desirous also that I might see, and hear, and know of these things, 
by the power of the Holy Ghost, which is the gift of God unto all those who diligently 
seek him, as well in times of old as in the time that he should manifest himself unto the 
children of men. 

<tr><td><b><a name="18">10:18</b></a>   For <span class="plag">he is the same yesterday, to-day, 
and forever</span>; and the 
way is <span class="plag">prepared for all men from the foundation of the world</span>, if it so be that they repent 
and come unto him. 

<tr><td><b><a name="19">10:19</b></a>   For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the 
mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy Ghost, as well in 
these times as in times of old, and as well in times of old as in times to come; 
wherefore, the course of the Lord is one eternal round. 

<tr><td><b><a name="20">10:20</b></a>   Therefore remember, O man, for all thy doings thou shalt be 
brought into judgment. 

<tr><td><b><a name="21">10:21</b></a>   Wherefore, if ye have sought to do wickedly in the days of 
your probation, then ye are found unclean before the judgment-seat of God; and no unclean 
thing can dwell with God; wherefore, ye must be cast off forever. 

<tr><td><b><a name="22">10:22</b></a>   And the Holy Ghost giveth authority that I should speak 
these things, and deny them not.
