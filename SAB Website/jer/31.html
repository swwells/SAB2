<img src="../images/pr1.gif" >(31:15) <i>"A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; 
Rachel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not."</i><br>
Matthew (<A href="../mt/2.html#17">2:17-18</A>)
quotes this verse, claiming that it was a prophecy of King Herod's alleged
slaughter of the children in and around Bethlehem after the birth of Jesus. But
this passage refers to the Babylonian captivity, as is clear by reading the next
two verses (16 and 17), and, thus, has nothing to do with Herod's massacre.
