<p><li>The people who heard Muhammad's "revelations" thought they sucked, saying, "Find another messenger or change the message."

<p><li>Denying the revelations of Allah is the worst sin imaginable. <a href="index.htm#17">10:17</a>

<p><li>"Neither dust nor ignominy cometh near their faces."
Muslims will look good in heaven. There'll be no dust on their faces!  <a href="index.htm#26">10:26</a> 

<p><li>The Quran is so perfect it could never be invented. Go ahead and try to write a Surah as great as those in the Quran.

 <p><li>"Allah wrongeth not mankind in aught; but mankind wrong themselves."<br>
Nah, Allah never hurt anyone. Well, he did drown everyone on earth except Noah and his family. And he's going to torture every non-muslim 
forever after they die. But other than that (and other cruel stuff like it), what did Allah ever do to anyone?

<p><li>The Pharaoh became a Muslim to avoid being drowned by Allah. <a href="index.htm#90">10:90</a> 

<p><li><i>"And We verily did allot unto the Children of Israel a fixed abode."</i><br>
Really? Then why do modern Muslims object to Jews occupying the land (Israel) that Allah gave them?
