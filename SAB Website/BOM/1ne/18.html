(18:1) God shows Nephi how to work timbers of curious workmanship. (Where did Nephi find the timbers? There are very 
few trees in the Arabian desert.) 

<br><i>"We did work timbers of curious workmanship. And the Lord did show me from time to time after what 
manner I should work the timbers of the ship."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (18:2-23) 

<p>(18:2) Nephi explains (several times in the same verse) that he didn't work the timbers 
after the manner of men, but in the manner that God showed him.

<br><i>"Now I, Nephi, did not work the timbers after the manner which was learned by men, neither did I build the ship after the manner 
of men; but I did build it after the manner which the Lord had shown unto me; wherefore, it was not after the manner of men."</i>

<p>(18:4) The ship took less than two verses to build, but by all accounts it turned out exceedingly fine.

<br><i>"After I had finished the ship ... my brethren beheld that it was good, and that the workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine."</i>

<p>(18:6) When it was finished, they gathered up their stuff and boarded their unnamed ship, every 
one according to his age.

<br><i>"We did go down into the ship, with all our loading and our seeds ... every one according to his age."</i>

<p>(18:8) After they all got on board, they sailed off toward the promised land (America in BoM-speak).

<br><i>"We ... were driven forth ... towards the promised land."</i>

<p> (18:9) And then, after the space of many days, there was mutiny on the nameless ship. (Nephi 
didn't keep much of a log. Everything happens "after a space of many days.") Nephi's brothers, Ishmael's sons, and all their wives 
began to merrily dance, sing, and speak with exceeding rudeness.

<br><i>"After ... the space of many days, behold, my brethren and the sons of Ishmael and 
also their wives began to make themselves merry, insomuch that they began to dance, and to sing, and to speak with much rudeness, yea 
... unto exceeding rudeness."</i>

<p>(18:10) So he, Nephi, began to fear exceedingly that God would smite them for dancing, singing, 
and carrying on like that. So he spoke to them with much soberness. But they all said unto him in unison, "Fuck off, little brother."

<br><i>"And I, Nephi, began to fear exceedingly lest the Lord should ... smite us ... wherefore, I, Nephi, began to speak to them with 
much soberness; but behold they were angry with me, saying: We will not that our younger brother shall be a ruler over us."</i>

<p>(18:11) Finally, Laman and Lemuel got so sick of Nephi's pompous ass that they tied him up again 
(See <a href="7.html#16">1 Nephi 7:16</a>).

<br><i>"Laman and Lemuel did take me and bind me with cords."</i>

<p>(18:12) Then the magic compass stopped working.

<br><i>"And it came to pass that ... the compass ... did cease to work."</i>

<p><p>(18:13) So they didn't know which way to steer. And then a great and terrible tempest came up 
for the space of three days. Everyone was exceedingly frightened. Still, they didn't untie Nephi.

<br><i>"Wherefore, they knew not whither they should steer the ship, insomuch that there arose a great storm, yea, a great and 
terrible tempest ... for the space of three days; and they began to be frightened exceedingly ... nevertheless they did not loose me."</i>

<p>(18:14) The tempest became exceedingly sore on the fourth day.

<br><i>"On the fourth day ... the tempest began to be exceedingly sore."</i>

<p>(18:15) And just when they were about to be swallowed up in the depths 
of the sea, they untied Nephi, whose wrists and ankles had swollen exceedingly and great was the soreness thereof.

<br><i>"We were about to be swallowed up in the depths of the sea ... They ... loosed the bands 
which were upon my wrist, and behold they had swollen exceedingly ... and great was the soreness thereof."</i>

<p>(18:16) Still, Nephi didn't murmur against the Lord but praised him all day long.

<br><i>"Nevertheless, I did look unto my God, and I did praise him all the day long; and I did not murmur against the Lord."</i>

<p>(18:17-18) Nephi's dad said many things to the mutineers, but they ignored him. The rude behavior 
of their children sickened Lehi and his wife Sariah. (They were "stricken in years" and about to die even though they just had a couple 
of baby boys a few verses ago. See <a href="#7">1 Nephi 18:7</a>)

<br><i>"Now my father, Lehi, had said many things unto them ... and my parents being stricken in years ... were near to be cast with 
sorrow into a watery grave."</i>

<p>(18:19) Poor little Jacob and Joseph were in need of much nourishment (Was Sariah still 
breastfeeding them?) and Nephi's nameless wife cried and prayed, along with Nephi's nameless children.

<br><i>"Jacob and Joseph ... being young, having need of much nourishment ... 
and also my wife with her tears and prayers, and also my children"</i>

<p>(18:21) Finally they untied Nephi. The magic compass magically started working again and there 
was a great calm. 

<br><i>"After they had loosed me, behold, I took the compass, and it did work whither I desired it ... and after I had prayed ... the 
storm did cease, and there was a great calm."</i>

<p> (18:22) I guess the calm didn't last forever, though, because the ship began to sail again 
toward the promised land.

<br><i>"I, Nephi, did guide the ship, that we sailed again towards the promised land."</i>

<p>(18:23) And after the space of many days, they arrived in the promised land. (And they did 
call it the promised land.)

<br><i>"After we had sailed for the space of many days we did arrive at the promised land ... and we did call it 
the promised land."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif">
<img src="../../images/sci1.gif"> (18:24-25) 

<p>(18:24) After arriving in the New World, Nephi and company planted all of the seeds that 
they brought from "the land of Jerusalem" and "they did grow exceedingly." Yet there is no evidence that Near Eastern crops 
ever grew in the New World in pre-Columbian times.

<br><i>"We ... put all our seeds into the earth which we had brought from the land of Jerusalem ... And ... they did grow exceedingly."</i>

<p>(18:25a) Nephi found cows, horses, oxen, and asses when he arrived in the New World in 590 BCE. 
(None of these domesticated animals existed in North America before the Europeans brought them over 2000 years later.)

<br><i>"There were beasts ... of every kind, both the cow and the ox, and the ass and the horse, and the goat and the wild goat, and 
all manner of wild animals."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (18:25b) And they found lots of gold, silver, and copper.

<br><i>"And we did find ... gold, ... silver, and ... copper."</i>

of men. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="3">18:3</b></a>   And I, Nephi, did go into the mount oft, and I did pray oft unto the 
Lord; wherefore the Lord showed unto me great things. 

<tr><td><b><a name="4">18:4</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that <span class="a">after I had finished 
the ship</span>, according to the word of the Lord, <span class="a">my brethren beheld that it was good, and that 
the workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine</span>; wherefore, they did 
humble themselves again before the Lord. 

<tr><td><b><a name="5">18:5</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the voice of the Lord 
came unto my father, that we should arise and go down into the ship. 

<tr><td><b><a name="6">18:6</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that on the morrow, after we 
had prepared all things, much fruits and meat from the wilderness, and honey in abundance, 
and provisions according to that which the Lord had commanded us, <span class="a">we did go down into the 
ship, with all our loading and our seeds</span>, and whatsoever thing we had brought with us, 
<span class="a">every one according to his age</span>; wherefore, we did all go down into the ship, with our 
wives and our children. 

<tr><td><b><a name="7">18:7</b></a>   And now, my father had begat two sons 
in the wilderness; the elder was called Jacob and the younger Joseph. 

<tr><td><b><a name="8">18:8</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> after we had all gone down 
into the ship, and had taken with us our provisions and things which had been commanded 
us, <span class="a">we</span> did put forth into the sea and <span class="a">were driven forth before the wind towards the 
promised land</span>. 

<tr><td><b><a name="9">18:9</b></a>   And <span class="a">after</span> we had been driven forth before the wind 
for <span class="a">the space of many days, behold, my brethren and the sons of Ishmael and also their wives 
began to make themselves merry, insomuch that they began to dance, and to sing, and to 
speak with much rudeness, yea</span>, even that they did forget by what power they had been 
brought thither; yea, they were lifted up <span class="a">unto exceeding rudeness</span>. 

<tr><td><b><a name="10">18:10</b></a>   <span class="a">And I, Nephi, began to fear exceedingly lest 
the Lord should</span> be angry with us, and <span class="a">smite us</span> because of our iniquity, that we should be 
swallowed up in the depths of the sea; <span class="a">wherefore, I, Nephi, began to speak to them with 
much soberness; but behold they were angry with me, saying: We will not that our younger 
brother shall be a ruler over us. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="11">18:11</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came 
to pass</span> that <span class="a">Laman and Lemuel did take me and bind me with cords</span>, and they did treat 
me with much harshness; nevertheless, the Lord did suffer it that he might show forth his 
power, unto the fulfilling of his word which he had spoken concerning the wicked. 

<tr><td><b><a name="12">18:12</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that</span> after they had bound 
me insomuch that I could not move, <span class="a">the compass</span>, which had been prepared of the Lord, <span class="a">did 
cease to work. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="13">18:13</b></a>   <span class="a">Wherefore, they knew not whither they should steer 
the ship, insomuch that there arose a great storm, yea, a great and terrible tempest</span>, and 
we were driven back upon the waters <span class="a">for the space of three days; and they began to be 
frightened exceedingly</span> lest they should be drowned in the sea; 
<span class="a">nevertheless they did not loose me.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="14">18:14</b></a>   And <span class="a">on the fourth day</span>, which we had been driven back, <span class="a">the 
tempest began to be exceedingly sore</span>. 

<tr><td><b><a name="15">18:15</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that <span class="a">we were about to be 
swallowed up in the depths of the sea.</span>  And after we had been driven back upon the waters 
for the space of four days, my brethren began to see that the judgments of God were upon 
them, and that they must perish save that they should repent of their iniquities; 
wherefore, <span class="a">they</span> came unto me, and <span class="a">loosed the bands which were upon my wrist, and behold 
they had swollen exceedingly; and also mine ankles were much 
swollen, and great was the soreness thereof. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="16">18:16</b></a>   <span class="a">Nevertheless, I did look unto my God, and I did praise him all the 
day long; and I did not murmur against the Lord</span> because of mine afflictions. 

<tr><td><b><a name="17">17</b></a>   <span class="a">Now my father, Lehi, had said many things unto them</span>, and also unto 
the sons of Ishmael; but, behold, they did breathe out much threatenings against anyone 
that should speak for me; <span class="a">and my parents being stricken in years</span>, and having suffered 
much grief because of their children, they were brought down, yea, even upon their 
sick-beds. 

<tr><td><b><a name="18">18:18</b></a>   Because of their grief and much sorrow, and the iniquity of my 
brethren, they were brought near even to be carried out of this time to meet their God; 
yea, their grey hairs were about to be brought down to lie low in the dust; yea, even 
they <span class="a">were near to be cast with sorrow into a watery grave. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="19">18:19</b></a>   And <span class="a">Jacob and Joseph</span> also, <span class="a">being young, having need of much 
nourishment</span>, were grieved because of the afflictions of their mother; <span class="a">and also my wife with 
her tears and prayers, and also my children</span>, did not soften the hearts of my brethren that 
they would loose me. 

<tr><td><b><a name="20">18:20</b></a>   And there was nothing save it were the power of God, which threatened 
them with destruction, could soften their hearts; wherefore, when they saw that they were 
about to be swallowed up in the depths of the sea they repented of the thing which they 
had done, insomuch that they loosed me. 

<tr><td><b><a name="21">18:21</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass after they had loosed me, 
behold, I took the compass, and it did work whither I desired it.</span>  <span class="a">And it 
came to pass</span> that I prayed unto the Lord; <span class="a">and after I had prayed</span> the winds did 
cease, and <span class="a">the storm did cease, and there was a great calm.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="22">18:22</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that <span class="a">I, Nephi, did guide 
the ship, that we sailed again towards the promised land. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="23">18:23</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that <span class="a">after we had sailed 
for the space of many days we did arrive at the promised land</span>; and we went forth upon the 
land, and did pitch our tents; <span class="a">and we did call it the promised land. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="24">18:24</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that we did begin to till 
the earth, and we began to plant seeds; yea, <span class="sci">we did put all our seeds into the earth, 
which we had brought from the land of Jerusalem.</span>  <span class="a">And it came to 
pass</span> that <span class="sci">they did grow </span><span class="a">exceedingly</span>; wherefore, we were 
blessed in abundance. 

<tr><td><b><a name="25">18:25</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that we did find upon the 
land of promise, as we journeyed in the wilderness, that <span class="sci">there were beasts</span> in the forests 
<span class="sci">of every kind, both the cow and the ox, and the ass and the horse, and the goat and the 
wild goat, and all manner of wild animals</span>, which were for the use of men.  <span class="a">And we did 
find all manner of ore, both of gold, and of silver, and of copper. </span>
