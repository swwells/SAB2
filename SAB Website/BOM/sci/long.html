<h4>1 Nephi</h4>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../1ne/sci.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p><li>"I make a record in the language of 
my father ... the language of the Egyptians." That's a strange language an Israelite around 
600 BCE to write in!  <a href="../1ne/1.html#2">1:2</a> 
 
<p><li>Apparently the 400+ km hike from Jerusalem to the Red Sea took only three days. <a href="../1ne/2.html#5">2:5-6</a>

<p><li>Nephi named a "continually running" river that flowed from Arabia to 
the Red Sea after his son Laman. But there are no permanent rivers in Arabia and there is no evidence that such rivers existed in 600 BCE.
<a href="../1ne/2.html#8">2:8-9</a>

<p><li>God made the New World just for Nephi and his family. (For though it 
had been occupied by the Native Americans for tens of thousands of years, God made 
it for Nephi, not for them.) <a href="../1ne/2.html#20">2:20</a>

<p><li>Laban's sword blade was made of steel, long before steel existed.
 <a href="../1ne/4.html#9">4:9</a>
 
<p><li>"And he, supposing that I spake of the brethren of the church, and that I was truly that Laban whom I had slain, wherefore he 
did follow me."<br>Laban's servant figured Nephi was Laban and that he spoke for the church. 
What church? The Jews in 600 BCE didn't have churches, did they? <a href="../1ne/4.html#26">4:26</a>

<p><li>Lehi's brass plates told the story of Adam and Eve "who were our first parents." (So Mormons know Evolution is false.) <a href="../1ne/5.html#11">5:11</a>

<p><li>Nephi sees "many cities" settled by the Nephites in the New World. 
Yet no evidence of them has ever been found. <a href="../1ne/12.html#3">12:3</a>

<p><li>And then it came to pass that Nephi broke his steel bow. Of course steel didn't exist at the time, wouldn't work 
   well for a bow anyway, and would be hard to break. But, oh well. This is the Book of Mormon. <a href="../1ne/16.html#18">16:18</a>

<p><li>They come to a place that they call Bountiful, "because of its much fruit and 
also wild honey." But the Arabian coastline does not abound in fruit or honey, and hasn't for 
many thousands of years. <a href="../1ne/17.html#5">17:5</a>

<p><li>"We did work timbers of curious workmanship." But where did Nephi get the lumber? There are 
 very few trees in the Arabian desert.  <a href="../1ne/18.html#1">18:1</a>
 
<p><li>After arriving in the New World, Nephi and company planted 
all of the seeds that they brought from "the land of Jerusalem" and "they did grow
exceedingly." Yet there is no evidence that Near Eastern crops ever grew in the New 
World<br> in pre-Columbian times. <a href="../1ne/18.html#24">18:24</a>

<p><li>Nephi found cows, horses, oxen, asses, and goats and goats when he arrived in the 
New World in 590 BCE. Yet none of these domesticated animals existed in North America 
before the Europeans brought them over 2000 years later. <a href="../1ne/18.html#25">18:25</a>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="64692" endspan --><h4>2 Nephi</h4>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../2ne/sci.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p><li>In 590 BCE, Lehi and company found the Americas completely uninhabited. <a href="../2ne/1.html#8">1:8-9</a>

<p><li>Nephi brought along the brass plates and the magic ball (or compass) that God made with his own hands. This was 
about 1600 years before <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass#History_of_the_navigational_compass">compasses 
</a> were used in navigation.</font> <a href="../2ne/5.html#12">5:12</a>

<p><li>Nephi makes many swords [like Laban's, made of "the most precious steel" 
(<a href="../1ne/4.html#9">1 Ne 4:9</a>)]. Yet there is no evidence of metal swords in the New World before 
Columbus. <a href="../2ne/5.html#14">5:14</a>

<p><li>Nephi teaches his followers to build buildings and work in iron, copper, brass, steel, gold, and silver. 
But evidence is lacking for such pre-Columbian metallurgy, and it would be well beyond the capabilities of a handful of 
immigrants from the ancient Near-East around 590 BCE. <a href="../2ne/5.html#15">5:15</a>

<p><li>Wasn't it God that cut <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahab_%28demon%29">Rahab</a> (the sea 
monster) to pieces, wounded the dragon, and dried up the sea? 
Yeah, it was him all right. Who else could do <i>that</i>?  <a href="../2ne/8.html#9">8:9-10</a> 

<p><li>Jacob tells the Nephites that they are on an isle of the sea, and since the Bible mentions "isles of the sea" (see for example <a href="../../is/24.html#15">Isaiah 24:15</a>), 
there must be other isles that are inhabited by the descendants of other ancient seafaring Jews. (As I'm sure you've guessed by now, the other inhabitants of the "isles of the sea" are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamanite">
Polynesians</a>.) <a href="../2ne/10.html#20">10:20-21</a>

<p><li>"The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb...." I wonder what will become of the spiders. 
Will they be more friendly toward flies? And will the parasitic wasps find another way to feed their larvae? Or will they 
continue to feed off the living bodies of caterpillars? <a href="../2ne/21.html#6">21:6</a>

<p><li>"And  the weaned child shall put his hand in the cockatrice' den." A cockatrice is a serpent, hatched from a
cock's egg, that can kill with a glance. They are rare nowadays. <a href="../2ne/21.html#8">21:8</a>

<p><li>According to this verse, the moon produces its own light and the earth does not move. <a href="../2ne/23.html#23:10">23:10</a>
<p><li>When God gets really angry, he causes earthquakes. <a href="../2ne/23.html#13">23:13</a>

<p><li>Dragons will live in Babylonian palaces and satyrs will dance there. <a href="../2ne/23.html#21">23:21-22</a>

<p><li>"Out of the serpent's root shall come forth a <i>cockatrice</i>, and his fruit shall be a <i>fiery flying 
serpent</i>." What ever happened to these fascinating biblical creatures? <a href="../2ne/24.html#29">24:29</a>

<p><li> "And  the weaned child shall put his hand in the cockatrice's den." A cockatrice is a serpent, hatched from a 
cock's egg, that can kill with a glance. They are rare nowadays. <a href="../2ne/30.html#14">30:14</a>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="57097" endspan --><h4>Enos</h4>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../enos/sci.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p><li>"My father ... taught me in his language."<br>
Enos' father (Jacob) taught him in his language -- which, of course, was reformed Egyptian. (All native Americans spoke reformed Egyptian in 500 BCE.) <a href="../enos/1.html#1">1:1</a>

<p><li>A Cmimeter is a curved sword with the sharp edge on the convex side. This type of sword did not exist at  the time 
Enos was supposedly written (ca. 500 BCE). Indeed there is no evidence that swords of any kind existed in pre-Columbian 
America. <a href="../enos/1.html#20">1:20</a>

<p><li>The Nephites planted "all manner of grain" and all manner of cattle, goats, and horses. (Cattle, horses, 
and European grains were absent in pre-Columbian North America.) <a href="../enos/1.html#21">1:21</a>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="44827" endspan --><h4>Jarom</h4>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../jarom/sci.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p><li>The Nephites fortified their cities. (Why is there no evidence for these fortified cities?)
 <a href="../jarom/1.html#7">1:7</a>
<p><li>The Nephites "multplied exceedingly" and "became exceedingly rich" in gold, silver, iron, copper, brass, 
and steel making tools and weapons "of every kind." This was before steel existed, of course, and no evidence for any of 
these Nephite weapons, tools, cities, or technologies have ever been found. <a href="../jarom/1.html#8">1:8</a>


<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="15818" endspan --><h4>Mosiah</h4>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../mosiah/sci.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p><li>Lehi, a 7th century Israelite, was taught in the language of the Egyptians. <a href="../mosiah/1.html#4">1:4</a>

<p><li>The Nephites had to hand over half of their barley to the Lamanites. But that wouldn't have been a big deal 
since barley didn't exist in the New World at the time. <a href="../mosiah/7.html#22">7:22</a>

<p><li>Ammon finds ancient swords. If swords existed in pre-Columbian America, why is there no evidence of it 
today? <a href="../mosiah/8.html#11">8:11</a>

<p><li>Zeniff and his people plant all kinds of crops, including wheat and barley, neither of which were present 
until the Europeans brought them to America.   <a href="../mosiah/9.html#9">9:9</a>

<p><li>Zeniff arms his people with swords and cimeters. No evidence for these pre-Columbian weapons 
has ever been found.  <a href="../mosiah/9.html#16">9:16</a>

<p><li>More swords and cimeters. But no evidence for these pre-Columbian weapons 
has ever been found. <a href="../mosiah/10.html#8">10:8</a>

<p><li>"And of their brass and their iron ... fatlings ... and grain." -- none of which existed in the New World before being introduced by 
Europeans. <a href="../mosiah/11.html#3">11:3</a>

<p><li>"King Noah built many elegant and spacious buildings" ornamented with gold, silver, iron, brass, copper, and ziff.<br>
Why is there no evidence for these fancy buildings? There were many of them, decorated with gold and silver. Where are they now? And 
the metallurgy technology for iron and brass didn't exist prior to European contact. But there was plenty of ziff around at the time 
so that wouldn't have been a problem. <a href="../mosiah/11.html#8">11:8</a>

<p><li>The Amlicites were armed with swords and cimeters (ca. 87 BCE). But no evidence for these weapons has 
ever been found. <a href="../alma/2.html#12">2:12</a>
<p><li>No metal coins (ezrons, senines, ontis, etc.) have been found from pre-Columbia America. 
<a href="../alma/11.html#4">11:4-19</a>
<p><li>The New World in 78 BCE had many temples, sanctuaries, and synagogues that "were built after the manner 
of the Jews." Yet no evidence of these magnificent buildings has ever been found. <a href="../alma/16.html#13">16:13</a>
<p><li>Swords (presumably made of metal) are again mentioned as though though they were common in pre-Columbian 
America. But no evidence for their existence has ever been found. <a href="../alma/17.html#7">17:7</a>
<p><li>Ammon had lots of horses an chariots, at a time when neither horses nor chariots existed in the New World.
 <a href="../alma/18.html#9">18:9-10</a>
<p><li>Lamoni had horses and chariots. But horses and wheeled transportation didn't exist in the Pre-Columbian 
New World. <a href="../alma/20.html#6">20:6</a>
<p><li>Just another of the many swords that are mentioned in the Book of Mormon at a time and place where 
swords did not exist. <a href="../alma/20.html#16">20:16</a>
<p><li>More metal swords, cimeters, and breastplates, none of which has ever been found. </font>

no evidence for such weapons in the Pre-Columbian New World has ever been found. <a href="../hel/1.html#14">1:14</a>
<p><li>The Nephites "began to cover the whole earth." Yet no evidence for Native Americans of Israelite descent has 
ever been found. <a href="../hel/3.html#8">3:8</a>
<p><li>The Nephites built cities, temples, synagogues, sanctuaries, "and all manner of buildings." But no trace of 
them has ever been found. <a href="../hel/3.html#9">3:9</a>
<p><li>The Nephites had a large timber industry. They exported "much by the way of shipping." 
Of course, there is no evidence for any of this now. <a href="../hel/3.html#10"></a>
<p><li>The Nephites built "many cities, both of wood and of cement." No evidence of them exists today.
 <a href="../hel/3.html#11">3:11</a>
<p><li>The Nephites built ships, temples, synagogues, and sanctuaries. But no one has found any evidence of them.
 <a href="../hel/3.html#14">3:14</a>
<p><li>The Nepites wrote many books and records "of every kind", but no evidence for them exists today.
 <a href="../hel/3.html#15">3:15</a>
<p><li>"From the west sea [Pacific], even unto the east [Atlantic]; it being a day's journey for a Nephite."

<a href="../ether/1.html#33">1:33</a>

<p><li>The Jaredites brought domesticated old world animals and plants "of every kind" to the New World.  <a href="../ether/1.html#41">1:41</a>

 <p><li>"They did also carry with them deseret, which, by interpretation, is a honey bee."<br>
There were no honey bees in the New World before they were introduced by Europeans in the 17th century.

<p><li>The brother of Jared made 16 small stones, as clear as glass, out of molten rock. He then
