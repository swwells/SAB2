<p><li>"Be not soon shaken in mind ... by letter as from us."<br>
What letter is being referred to here? Is it 1 Thessalonians? If so, then should Christians not read it to avoid being "skaken 
in mind?" <a href="2.html#2">2:2</a>

<p><li>If Paul wrote this letter (and many scholars think he didn't), then he is changing his mind (since writing 1 Thessalonians)
 about the timing of the Christ's return. The day of the Lord is no longer at hand. In fact it's nowhere near. Many things must happen 
 first: there will be a great "falling away", a "man of sin" will be reveled, and Satan will show off his power by doing all kinds of 
 signs and wonders. <a href="2.html#2">2:2-9</a>

<p><li>Although 2 Thessalonians claims to have been written by Paul, many scholars think it was a forgery.
 <a href="1.html#1">1:1</a>, <a href="3.html#17">3:17</a> 

<p><li>Jehovah's Witnesses use these verses to justify disfellowshipping anyone who disagrees with the 
Watchtower's teachings. <a href="3.html#6">3:6, 14</a>
