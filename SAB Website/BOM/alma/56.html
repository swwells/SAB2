"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",
"<span class='i'>Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever.</span>--<a href='3.html#14'>Alma 3:14</a>",
"<span class='i'>I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</span>--<a href='3.html#15'>Alma 3:15</a>",
"<span class='I'>If ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd ... the devil is your shepherd.</span>--<a href='5.html#39'>Alma 5:39</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",
"<span class='a'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges ... even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year....</span>--<a href='16.html#1'>Alma 16:1</a>",
"<span class='a'>Their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.</span>--<a href='16.html#11'>Alma 16:11</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",
"<span class='v'>He [Ammon] smote off their arms with his sword; for he did withstand their blows by smiting their arms with the edge of his sword.</span>--<a href='17.html#37'>Alma 17:37</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.   Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</span>--<a href='30.html#22'>Alma 30:22</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",
"<span class='i'>God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.</span>--<a href='30.html#47'>Alma 30:47</a>",
"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Amalekites were of a more wicked and murderous disposition than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='43.html#6'>Alma 43:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lord is with us; and ye behold that he has delivered you into our hands.</span>--<a href='44.html#3'>Alma 44:3</a>",
"<span class='i'>God ... has strengthened  our arms that we have gained power over you, by  our faith, by our religion, and by our rites of worship, and by  our church.</span>--<a href='44.html#5'>Alma 44:5</a>",
"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",
"<span class='i'>These dissenters ... became ... more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='47.html#36'>Alma 47:36</a>",
"<span class='a'>God would prosper them in the land, or in other words ... God ... would prosper them in the land.</span>--<a href='48.html#15'>Alma 48:15</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='50.html#22'>Alma 50:22</a>",
"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",
"<span class='i'>The remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty.</span>--<a href='51.html#20'>Alma 51:20</a>",
"<span class='g'>And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye.</span>--<a href='54.html#21'>Alma 54:21</a>",
"<span class='v'>We did slay upwards of two thousand of them after they had surrendered themselves prisoners of war.</span>--<a href='57.html#14'>Alma 57:14</a>",

(56:1, 18, 22, 27, 32, 33, 35, 36, 39, 41, 42, 49, 52, 54, 55)
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>56:2</b>   And these are the words which he wrote, saying: My dearly beloved brother, Moroni, as well in 
the Lord as in the tribulations of our warfare; behold, my beloved brother, I have somewhat to tell you 
concerning our warfare in this part of the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>56:3</b>   Behold, two thousand of the sons of those men whom Ammon brought down out of the land of 
Nephi -- now ye have known that these were descendants of Laman, who was the eldest son of our 
father Lehi; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>56:4</b>   Now I need not rehearse unto you concerning their traditions or their unbelief, for thou 
knowest concerning all these things --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>56:5</b>   Therefore it sufficeth me that I tell you that two thousand of these young men have taken 
their weapons of war, and would that I should be their leader; and we have come forth to defend our country. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>56:6</b>   And now ye also know concerning the covenant which their fathers made, that they would not take 
up their weapons of war against their brethren to shed blood. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>56:7</b>   But in the twenty and sixth year, when they saw our afflictions and our tribulations for 
them, they were about to break the covenant which they had made and take up their weapons of war in our defence. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>56:8</b>   But I would not suffer them that they should break this covenant which they had made, supposing 
that God would strengthen us, insomuch that we should not suffer more because of the fulfilling the oath which 
they had taken. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>56:9</b>   But behold, here is one thing in which we may have great joy.   For behold, in the twenty 
and sixth year, I, Helaman, did march at the head of these two thousand young men to the city of Judea, to 
assist Antipus, whom ye had appointed a leader over the people of that part of the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>56:10</b>   And I did join my two thousand sons, (for they are worthy to be called sons) to the army of 
Antipus, in which strength Antipus did rejoice <span class="a">exceedingly</span>; for behold, his army had been 
reduced by the Lamanites because their forces had slain a vast number of our men, for which cause we have to mourn. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1"><a href="exceed_list.html">Exceedingly</a> (56:10, 52)
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>56:11</b>   Nevertheless, we may console ourselves in this point, that they have died in the cause of 
their country and of their God, yea, and they are happy. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>56:12</b>   And the Lamanites had also retained many prisoners, all of whom are chief captains, for none 
other have they spared alive.   And we suppose that they are now at this time in the land of Nephi; it is so if 
they are not slain. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>56:13</b>   And now these are the cities of which the Lamanites have obtained possession by the shedding of 
the blood of so many of our valiant men: <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>56:14</b>   The land of Manti, or the city of Manti, and the city of Zeezrom, and the city of Cumeni, and the 
city of Antiparah. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>56:15</b>   And these are the cities which they possessed when I arrived at the city 
of Judea; and I found Antipus and his men toiling with their might to fortify the city. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>56:16</b>   Yea, and they were depressed in body as well as in spirit, for they had fought valiantly by 
day and toiled by night to maintain their cities; and thus they had suffered great afflictions of every kind. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>56:17</b>   And now they were determined to conquer in this place or die; therefore you may well suppose 
that this little force which I brought with me, yea, those sons of mine, gave them great hopes and much joy. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>56:18</b>   <span class="a">And now it came to pass</span> that when the Lamanites saw that Antipus had received a greater strength 
to his army, they were compelled by the orders of Ammoron to not come against the city of Judea, or against us, 
to battle. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>56:19</b>   And thus were we favored of the Lord; for had they come upon us in this our weakness they 
might have perhaps destroyed our little army; but thus were we preserved. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>56:20</b>   They were commanded by Ammoron to maintain those cities which they had taken.  And thus ended 
the twenty and sixth year.  And in the commencement of the twenty and seventh year we had prepared our city 
and ourselves for defence. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>56:21</b>   Now we were desirous that the Lamanites should come upon us; for we were not desirous to 
make an attack upon them in their strongholds. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>56:22</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that we kept spies out round about, to watch the 
movements of the Lamanites, that they might not pass us by night nor by day to make an attack upon our other 
cities which were on the northward. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>56:23</b>   For we knew in those cities they were not sufficiently strong to meet them; therefore we were 
desirous, if they should pass by us, to fall upon them in their rear, and thus bring them up in the rear at the 
same time they were met in the front.  We supposed that we could overpower them; but behold, we were 
disappointed in this our desire. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>56:24</b>   They durst not pass by us with their whole army, neither durst they with a part, lest they 
should not be sufficiently strong and they should fall. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>56:25</b>   Neither durst they march down against the city of Zarahemla; neither durst they cross the 
head of Sidon, over to the city of Nephihah. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>56:26</b>   And thus, with their forces, they were determined to maintain those cities which they had 
taken. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>56:27</b>   <span class="a">And now it came to pass</span> in the second month of this year, there was brought unto us many 
provisions from the fathers of those my two thousand sons. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>56:28</b>   And also there were sent two thousand men unto us from the land of Zarahemla.  And thus we 
were prepared with ten thousand men, and provisions for them, and also for their wives and their children. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>56:29</b>   And the Lamanites, thus seeing our forces increase daily, and provisions arrive for our 
support, they began to be fearful, and began to sally forth, if it were possible to put an end to our 
receiving provisions and strength. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>56:30</b>   Now when we saw that the Lamanites began to grow uneasy on this wise, we were desirous to 
bring a stratagem into effect upon them; therefore Antipus ordered that I should march forth with my little 
sons to a neighboring city, as if we were carrying provisions to a neighboring city. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>56:31</b>   And we were to march near the city of Antiparah, as if we were going to the city beyond, in the 
borders by the seashore. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="32"></a>56:32</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that we did march forth, as if with our provisions, 
to go to that city. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="33"></a>56:33</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Antipus did march forth 
with a part of his army, leaving the remainder to maintain the city.  But he did not march forth until I had gone 
forth with my little army, and came near the city Antiparah. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="34"></a>56:34</b>   And now, in the city Antiparah were stationed the strongest army of the Lamanites; yea, the 
most numerous. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="35"></a>56:35</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when they had been informed by their spies, 
they came forth with their army and marched against us. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="36"></a>56:36</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that we did flee before them, northward.   And 
thus we did lead away the most powerful army of the Lamanites; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="37"></a>56:37</b>   Yea, even to a considerable distance, insomuch that when they saw the army of Antipus 
pursuing them, with their might, they did not turn to the right nor to the left, but pursued their march 
in a straight course after us; and, as we suppose, it was their intent to slay us before Antipus should 
overtake them, and this that they might not be surrounded by our people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="38"></a>56:38</b>   And now Antipus, beholding our danger, did speed the march of his army.  But behold, it was 
night; therefore they did not overtake us, neither did Antipus overtake them; therefore we did camp for the 
night. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="39"></a>56:39</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that before the dawn of the morning, behold, 
the Lamanites were pursuing us.  Now we were not sufficiently strong to contend with them; yea, I would 
not suffer that my little sons should fall into their hands; therefore we did continue our march, and we 
took our march into the wilderness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="40"></a>56:40</b>   Now they durst not turn to the right nor to the left lest they should be surrounded; 
neither would I turn to the right nor to the left lest they should overtake me, and we could not stand 
against them, but be slain, and they would make their escape; and thus we did flee all that day into the 
wilderness, even until it was dark. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="41"></a>56:41</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that again, when the light of the morning 
came we saw the Lamanites upon us, and we did flee before them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="42"></a>56:42</b>   <span class="a">But it came to pass</span> that they did not pursue us far before they halted; and it was in the 
morning of the third day of the seventh month. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="43"></a>56:43</b>   And now, whether they were overtaken by Antipus we knew not, but I said unto my men: 
Behold, we know not but they have halted for the purpose that we should come against them, that they 
might catch us in their snare; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="44"></a>56:44</b>   Therefore what say ye, my sons, will ye go against them to battle? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="45"></a>56:45</b>   And now I say unto you, my beloved brother Moroni, that never had I seen so great courage, 
nay, not amongst all the Nephites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="46"></a>56:46</b>   For as I had ever called them my sons (for they were all of them very young) even so they 
said unto me: Father, behold our God is with us, and he will not suffer that we should fall; then let us go 
forth; we would not slay our brethren if they would let us alone; therefore let us go, lest they should 
overpower the army of Antipus. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="47"></a>56:47</b>   Now they never had fought, yet they did not fear death; and they did think more upon the 
liberty of their fathers than they did upon their lives; yea, they had been taught by their mothers, that 
if they did not doubt, God would deliver them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="48"></a>56:48</b>   And they rehearsed unto me the words of their mothers, saying: We do not doubt our 
mothers knew it. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="49"></a>56:49</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that I did return with my two thousand 
against these Lamanites who had pursued us.  And now behold, the armies of Antipus had overtaken them, 
and a terrible battle had commenced. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="50"></a>56:50</b>   The army of Antipus being weary, because of their long march in so short a space of time, 
were about to fall into the hands of the Lamanites; and had I not returned with my two thousand they would 
have obtained their purpose. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="51"></a>56:51</b>   For Antipus had fallen by the sword, and many of his leaders, because of their weariness, 
which was occasioned by the speed of their march -- therefore the men of Antipus, being confused because of 
the fall of their leaders, began to give way before the Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="52"></a>56:52</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Lamanites took courage, and began to 
pursue them; and thus were the Lamanites pursuing them with great vigor when Helaman came upon their rear 
with his two thousand, and began to slay them <span class="a">exceedingly</span>, insomuch that the whole 
army of the Lamanites halted and turned upon Helaman. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="53"></a>56:53</b>   Now when the people of Antipus saw that the Lamanites had turned them about, they gathered 
together their men and came again upon the rear of the Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="54"></a>56:54</b>   <span class="a">And now it came to pass</span> that we, the people of Nephi, the people of Antipus, and I with my 
two thousand, did surround the Lamanites, and did slay them; yea, insomuch that they were compelled to 
deliver up their weapons of war and also themselves as prisoners of war. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="55"></a>56:55</b>   <span class="a">And now it came to pass</span> that when they had surrendered themselves up unto us, behold, I 
numbered those young men who had fought with me, fearing lest there were many of them slain. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="56"></a>56:56</b>   But behold, to my great joy, there had not one soul of them fallen to the earth; yea, and they 
had fought as if with the strength of God; yea, never were men known to have fought with such miraculous 
strength; and with such mighty power did they fall upon the Lamanites, that they did frighten them; and 
for this cause did the Lamanites deliver themselves up as prisoners of war. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="57"></a>56:57</b>   And as we had no place for our prisoners, that we could guard them to keep them from 
the armies of the Lamanites, therefore we sent them to the land of Zarahemla, and a part of those men 
who were not slain of Antipus, with them; and the remainder I took and joined them to my stripling 
Ammonites, and took our march back to the city of Judea. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
