"fill his bowels" with it. He does, and finds it to be as sweet as honey.

<p>(3:1) <i>"He said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll."</i>

<p>(3:2) <i>"So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll."</i>

<p> (3:3) <i>"And he said unto me ... fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in 
my mouth as honey for sweetness."</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (3:4-7) After Ezekiel eats the scroll, God sends him off to preach to the Israelites, though God 
knows they won't listen to him.

    and speak with my words unto them."</i>

<p>If Ezekiel doesn't warn the wicked that God's 
going to kill them for being wicked, God will kill the wicked people and Ezekiel, too. Or God will force Ezekiel to kill the wicked people. Or God will force Ezekiel to kill himself. Or something.

<p>If Ezekiel warns the wicked, then God will kill the wicked people (if they don't change their wicked ways), but not Ezekiel.

<p>If a good person does something wrong after
God "lays a stumbling block before him," then God will kill him.
"He shall die in his sin" and whatever good he has done will be forgotten. And Ezekiel will be killed, too, if he didn't warn the good guy beforehand. Or something. (See the first if above.)

<p>(3:18) <i>"When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning ... the same wicked man shall 
die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand."</i>

<p>(3:19) <i>"Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness ... he shall die in his iniquity; 
but thou hast delivered thy soul."</i>

<p>(3:20) <i>"When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, 
he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered;

(3:24-26)<br> The spirit (of God?) enters Ezekiel, ties him up, and makes 
his tongue stick to the roof of his mouth so that he could no longer speak.

<p>(3:25) <i>"They shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them."</i>

  But thou, <span class="a">O son of man, 
  behold, they shall put bands upon thee</span>, and shall
    bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="26">3:26</A></B>
  <span class="a">And I will make thy tongue 
  cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou
    shalt be dumb</span>, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a
    rebellious house.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="27">3:27</A></B>
  But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto
    them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that
    forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.
