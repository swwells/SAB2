Blessed is He Who hath revealed unto His slave the Criterion (of right and  wrong), that he may be a warner to the peoples. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

He unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, He  hath chosen no son nor hath He any partner in the Sovereignty. He hath created  everything and hath meted out for it a measure. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Yet they choose beside Him other gods who create naught but are themselves  created, and possess not hurt nor profit for themselves, and possess not death nor life,  nor power to raise the dead. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="4"><b>25:4</a></b>
Those who disbelieve say: This is naught but a lie that he hath invented, and  other folk have helped him with it, so that they have produced a slander and a lie. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="5"><b>25:5</a></b>
And they say: Fables of the men of old which he hath had written down so  that they are dictated to him morn and evening. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="6"><b>25:6</a></b>

Say (unto them, O Muhammad): He who knoweth the secret of the heavens  and the earth hath revealed it. Lo! He ever is Forgiving, Merciful. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="7"><b>25:7</a></b>
And they say: What aileth this messenger (of Allah) that he eateth food and  walketh in the markets ? Why is not an angel sent down unto him, to be a warner with  him. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="8"><b>25:8</a></b>
Or (why is not) treasure thrown down unto him, or why hath he not a  paradise from whence to eat ? And the evil-doers say: Ye are but following a man  bewitched. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="9"><b>25:9</a></b>
See how they coin similitudes for thee, so that they are all astray and cannot  find a road! <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Blessed is He Who, if He will, will assign thee better than (all) that - Gardens  underneath which rivers flow  - and will assign thee mansions. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><a NAME="18"><b>25:18</a></b>

And We shall turn unto the work they did and make it scattered motes. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

A day when the heaven with the clouds will be rent asunder and the angels  will be sent down, a grand descent. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

And We have sent thee (O Muhammad) only as a bearer of good tidings and  a warner. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Say: I ask of you no reward for this, save that whoso will may choose a way  unto his Lord. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="58"><b>25:58</a></b>
And trust thou in the Living One Who dieth not, and hymn His praise. He  sufficeth as the Knower of His bondmen's sins, <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="59"><b>25:59</a></b>
Who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six  Days, then He mounted the Throne. The Beneficent! Ask anyone informed  concerning Him! <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="60"><b>25:60</a></b>

And when it is said unto them: Adore the Beneficent! they say: And what is  the Beneficent ? Are we to adore whatever thou (Muhammad) biddest us ? And it  increaseth aversion in them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="61"><b>25:61</a></b>
Blessed be He Who hath placed in the heaven mansions of the stars, and hath  placed therein a great lamp and a moon giving light! <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="62"><b>25:62</a></b>
And He it is Who hath appointed night and day in succession, for him who  desireth to remember, or desireth thankfulness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="63"><b>25:63</a></b>
The (faithful) slaves of the Beneficent are they who walk upon the earth  modestly, and when the foolish ones address them answer: Peace; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="64"><b>25:64</a></b>
And who spend the night before their Lord, prostrate and standing, <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

And who say: Our Lord! Avert from us <span class="v">the doom of hell; lo! the doom  thereof is anguish</span>;
