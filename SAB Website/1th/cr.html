<p><li>God is planning a messy, mass murder in "the wrath to come" and only Jesus can save you from it. 
<a href="1.html#10">1:10</a>

<p><li>Christians shouldn't mourn the death of their fellow believers. They'll be OK and you'll see them later in heaven. The people you should 
    mourn are dead nonbelievers. They have no hope (because they're going to hell). <a href="4.html#13">4:13</a>
