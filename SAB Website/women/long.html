<p><b><a href="../gen/wom_list.html">Genesis</a></b>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../gen/wom.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->
<p><li>God fashions a woman out of one of Adam's ribs. This was necessary since Adam
couldn't find a "help meet" in any of the animals that God made for him. 
<a href="../gen/2.html#20">2:20-22</a>

<p><li>Adam blames Eve and Eve blames the serpent.  <a href="../gen/3.html#12">3:12-13</a>

<p><li><i>"In sorrow thou shalt bring forth children. ... Thy husband ... shall rule over thee."</i><br>
God punishes Eve, and all women after her, with the pains of childbirth and subjection to
men.  <a href="../gen/3.html#16">3:16</a>

<p><li>Adam is also punished, although less severely. He now will have to work for a living because he 
    "hearkened unto the voice" of his wife. <a href="../gen/3.html#17">3:17</a>
    
<p><li>Lamech is the first of a long line of biblical men with more than one wife. It seems
that God approves of such marriages.  <a href="../gen/4.html#19">4:19, 23</a>

<p><li>Finally, sometime in the next 800 years, Adam begat some daughters. These nameless
ones are the first (and nearly the last) girls to be born in the Bible. <a href="../gen/5.html#4">5:4</a>

<p><li>"The male and his female ..." Notice that in the Bible female animals are the property of
male animals, as women are the property of men.  <a href="../gen/7.html#2">7:2</a>

<p><li>Abram makes his wife lie for him, by telling the Egyptians that she is his sister. But at
least it was half-true, since she was his half-sister. Such incestuous marriages are condemned
elsewhere in the Bible, but god makes an exception for Abram and Sarai. (See 
<a href="../gen/17.html#15">Genesis 17:15-16</a> where God blesses their marriage.) 
<a href="../gen/12.html#13">12:13</a>

<p><li>Sarai is the first of a long line of barren women who were desperate for children. (In
the Bible, it is the women who are barren, never the men.) She sends Abram into her
handmaid, Hagar, so that she can "obtain children by her." Abram gladly complies. 
<a href="../gen/16.html#1">16:1-4</a>

<p><li>Sarah, who is about 90 years old and has gone through menopause, laughs at God
when he tells her that she will have a son. She asks God if she will "have pleasure" with her
"Lord" [Abraham], when both are so very old. God assures her that he will return and
impregnate her at the appointed time.  <a href="../gen/18.html#11">18:11-14</a>

<p><li>Lot refuses to give up his angels to the perverted mob, offering his two "virgin daughters"
instead. He tells the bunch of angel rapers to "do unto them [his daughters] as is good in your
eyes." This is the same man that is called "just" and "righteous" in 
<a href="../2pet/2.html#7">2 Pet.2:7-8</a>. <a href="../gen/19.html#8">19:8</a>

<p><li>Lot's nameless wife looks back, and God turns her into a pillar of salt. 
<a href="../gen/19.html#26">19:26</a>

<p><li>Lot and his daughters camp out in a cave for a while. The daughters get their "just
and righteous" father drunk, and have sexual intercourse with him, and each conceives and
bears a son (wouldn't you know it!). Just another wholesome family values Bible story. 
<a href="../gen/19.html#30">19:30-38</a>

<p><li>Honest Abe does the same "she's my sister" routine again, for the same cowardly reason.
And once again, the king just couldn't resist Sarah -- even though by now she is over 90 years
old. (See <a href="../gen/12.html#13">Gen.12:13-20</a> for the first, nearly identical, episode.)  
<a href="../gen/20.html#2">20:2</a>

<p><li>God gets angry with king Abimelech, though the king hasn't even touched Sarah. He
says to the king, "Behold, thou art but a dead man," and threatens to kill him and all of his
people. To compensate for the crime he never committed, Abimelech gives Abraham sheep,
oxen, slaves, silver, and land. Finally, after Abraham "prayed unto God," God lifts his
punishment to Abimelech, "for the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of
Abimelech, because of Sarah."  <a href="../gen/20.html#3">20:3-18</a>

<p><li>God "closed all the wombs" because Abimelech believed Abe's lie. <a href="../gen/20.html#18">20:18</a>

<p><li>"And the damsel was fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her." (Oh
boy!) <a href="../gen/24.html#16">24:16</a>

<p><li>Abraham had several concubines.  <a href="../gen/25.html#6">25:6</a>

<p><li>"She was barren."<br>
In the Bible it's always the women that are "barren", never the men. And when God "opens their womb," the resulting babies are always little 
boys. <a href="../gen/25.html#21">25:21-26</a>

<p><li>Isaac uses the same "she's my sister" lie that his father twice used so effectively. (Once on the same King Abimelech) 
(see <a href="../gen/12.html#13">12:13</a>, <a href="../gen/20.html#2">20:2</a>). <a href="../gen/26.html#7">26:7</a>

<p><li>Esau &quot;takes&quot; two wives. <a href="../gen/26.html#34">26:34</a>

<p><li>Esau, who already had two wives (<a href="../gen/26.html#34" >26:34</a>), 
"takes" another. <a href="../gen/28.html#9">28:9</a>

<p><li>Jacob offers to work for seven years to pay for Rachel. As it turns out, he is tricked 
into having sex with her sister, Leah, instead, so he has to work for another seven years so in order 
to pay for them both.  <a href="../gen/29.html#18">29:18-30</a>

<p><li>Jacob is tricked by Laban, the father of Rachel and Leah. Jacob asks for Rachel so
that he can "go in unto her." But Laban gives him Leah instead, and Jacob "went in unto her
[Leah]" by mistake. Jacob was fooled until morning -- apparently he didn't know who he was
going in unto. Finally they worked things out and Jacob got to "go in unto" Rachel, too. 
<a href="../gen/29.html#21">29:21-30</a>

<p><li>As part of the deal with Jacob, Zilpah and Bilhah (Laban's slaves) are handed 
over to Leah and Rachel. <a href="../gen/29.html#24">29:24, 29</a>

<p><li>Since Jacob hated Leah, God decided to "open her womb" and make Rachel barren. (Like he did to Sarah and Rebekah.) 
 <a href="../gen/29.html#31">29:31</a>
 
<p><li>Leah conceives and bears four sons. And it's a good thing, too, since her husband 
hated her until then for not giving him any sons. <a href="../gen/29.html#32-34">29:32-34</a>

<p><li>"Give me children or else I die." Rachel considers herself worthless if she 
cannot produce children for her husband. But luckily she has an idea. She says to 
Jacob, "Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her." She solved the problem the same way 
as did Sarah (<a href="../gen/16.html#2">16:2</a>). "And Jacob went in unto her. And Bilhah 
conceived, and bare Jacob a son." (These arrangements rarely produce daughters.) 
<a href="../gen/30.html#1">30:1-4</a>

<p><li>Leah, not to be outdone, gives Jacob her maid (Zilpah) "to wife." And Zilpah "bare
Jacob a son." <a href="../gen/30.html#9">30:9</a>

<p><li>Leah thinks her husband will honor her now that she has given him six sons. <a href="../gen/30.html#20">30:20</a>

<p><li>And finally, "God remembered Rachel ... and opened her womb. And she conceived
and bare a son [surprise, surprise]." <a href="../gen/30.html#22">30:22</a>

<p><li>"Then Jacob ... set his ... wives upon camels." Jacob had four wives (or two wives and
two concubines -- this distinction is not clear in the Bible): Rachel, Leah, Billah, and Zilpah.
There is no indication that God disapproves of this arrangement. <a href="../gen/31.html#17">31:17</a>

<p><li>Jacob has two wives and two concubines, continuing the biblical tradition of polygamy. <a href="../gen/32.html#22">32:22</a>
<p><li>Laban, Rachel's father, is hunting for the "images" that Rachel had stolen from him.
Rachel sits on the "images" and says to her father, "Let it not displease my lord that I cannot
rise up before thee: for the custom of women is upon me." She knows that no man will come
near her when she is menstruating.  <a href="../gen/31.html#34">31:34-35</a>
<p><li>Jacob has two wives and two concubines, continuing the biblical tradition of polygamy. 
<a href="../gen/32.html#22">32:22</a>
<p><li><i>What did Dinah want?</i>  Did she love Shechem? 
Did she want to marry him? Or did she want him killed? We'll ever know since it was of no 
interest to the biblical author. <a href="../gen/34.html#1">34:1-31</a>
<p><li>Dinah's brothers, to justify the massacre of a town for the rape of their sister, say:
"Should he deal with our sister as with a harlot?" To the author of Genesis, rape is a
crime against the honor of men rather than against a woman.  <a href="../gen/34.html#31">34:31</a>
<p><li>Rachel dies in childbirth; but at least she had another son. And in the Bible, a
woman is expected to die happily as long as she has a son.  <a href="../gen/35.html#17">35:17-18</a>
<p><li>&quot;Reuben went and lay with his father's concubine.&quot;&nbsp; 
<a href="../gen/35.html#22">35:22</a>, <a href="../gen/49.html#4">49:4</a>
<p><li>Esau (Isaac's son) had several wives (continuing the tradition of polygamy, with no
editorial comment from the Bible). <a href="../gen/36.html#2">36:2, 6</a>
<p><li>"And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite ... and he took her, and went
in unto her. And she conceived, and bare a son; and she called his name Er. And she
conceived again [I guess Judah must have went in unto her again] and bare a son; and she
called hi name Onan." (It seems that the probability of having a biblical daughter is
considerably less than 50%.)  <a href="../gen/38.html#2">38:2-4</a>
<p><li>After Judah pays Tamar for her services, he is told that she "played the harlot" and "is
with child by whoredom." When Judah hears this, he says, "Bring her forth, and let her be
burnt."  <a href="../gen/38.html#24">38:24</a>

<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../ex/wom.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->
<p><li>To commemorate the divine massacre of the Egyptian children, Moses instructs the Israelites to "sacrifice to the
Lord all that openeth the matrix" -- all the males, that is. God has no use for dead, burnt female bodies.  
<a href="../ex/13.html#2">13:2, 12, 15</a>

<p><li>Moses, like a coach giving instructions to the team before the big game, tells the men to "come not at your wives" before
he goes up to Mt. Sinai.  <a href="../ex/19.html#15">19:15</a>

<p><li>"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, ... nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbor's." In the Bible, women are the
property of men; they are his possessions -- like an ox or an ass. <a href="../ex/20.html#17">20:17</a>

<p><li>How to sell your daughter -- and what to do if she fails to please her new master. 
<a href="../ex/21.html#7">21:7-8</a>

<p><li>God's instructions for taking a second wife.  <a href="../ex/21.html#10">21:10</a>

<p><li>If you "entice" an "unmarried maid" to "lie" with you, then you must marry her, unless the father refuses to give her to you,
in which case you must pay him the going price for virgins.  <a href="../ex/22.html#16">22:16</a>

<p><li>"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live." Thousands of innocent women have suffered excruciating deaths because of this
verse.  <a href="../ex/22.html#18">22:18</a>

<p><li>Three times a year God wants to see all of the males. The females he never wants to see. <a href="../ex/23.html#17">23:17</a>

<p><li>"Their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods." God always blames the
women; it is they who "go a whoring" and then "make" the men "go a whoring."  <a href="../ex/34.html#16">34:16</a>

<p><li>"Thrice in the year shall all your men children appear before the Lord." But what about the "women children"? Don't they
ever get to appear before the Lord?  <a href="../ex/34.html#23">34:23</a>
<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="21978" endspan --><p><b><a href="../lev/wom_list.html">Leviticus</a></b>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../lev/wom.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->
<p><li>Only unblemished males are to be killed and offered to God. Females don't even make
good burnt offerings.  <a href="../lev/1.html#3">1:3</a>, <a href="../lev/1.html#10">10</a>

<p><li>When a king sins only the best sacrifice will do -- he must offer a male goat to God.
But if a commoner sins, a female will do.  <a href="../lev/4.html#22">4:22-28</a>

<p><li>"If any one of the common people sin through ignorance ... then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, 
a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned."<br>
If a common person sins through ignorance, then kill a female goat. (More important people must kill male goats.) <a href="../lev/4.html#27">4:27-28</a>

<p><li>"He shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD ... a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats."<br>
If you touch an insect, dead animal, or "the uncleanness of man" or if you swear to do something good or bad (5:2-4), kill a female lamb or goat for God. (A female
 will do since it's a minor offense.) <a href="../lev/5.html#6">5:6</a>

<p><li>"She shall be unclean."<br>
Women are dirty and sinful after childbirth, so God prescribes rituals for their purification. 
(And baby girls make them twice as sinful and dirty as baby boys do.)   <a href="../lev/12.html#1">12:1-5</a>

<p><li>"If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days ... And she shall then 
continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days."<br>
If a boy is born, the mother is unclean for 7 days and must be purified for 33 days. <a href="../lev/12.html#2">12:2, 4</a>

<p><li>"But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks ... and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying 
threescore and six days."<br>
If a girl is born, the mother is unclean for 14 days and be purified for 66 days. This is because, in the eyes of God, 
girls are twice as dirty as boys. <a href="../lev/12.html#5">12:5</a>

<p><li>"She shall bring a lamb ... for a burnt offering, and... a young pigeon, or dove, for a sin offering."<br>
After a woman gives birth, a priest must kill a lamb, pigeon, or dove as a sin offering. This is because having children is sinful and God likes it when things are 
killed for him. <a href="../lev/12.html#6">12:6</a>

<p><li>"She shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood." <a href="../lev/12.html#7">12:7</a>

<p><li>"If she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons ... and she shall be clean." 
<a href="../lev/12.html#8">12:8</a>

<p><li>"The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water, 
and be unclean until the even." <a href="../lev/15.html#18">15:18</a>

<p><li><i>God's law for menstruating women</i><br>
They are unclean and sinful. Anthing that they touch is unclean. Anyone who touches anything that they touch is unclean. 
Stay completely away from them. (And for God's sake, don't even think about having sex with them!) <a href="../lev/15.html#19">15:19-30, 33</a>

<p><li>"If a woman have an issue, and her issue... be blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean 
until the even." <a href="../lev/15.html#19">15:19</a>

<p><li>"And every thing that she lieth upon in her separation shall be unclean: every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean." 
<a href="../lev/15.html#20">15:20</a>

<p><li>"And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even." 
<a href="../lev/15.html#21">15:21</a>

<p><li>"Whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall ... be unclean until the even." <a href="../lev/15.html#22">15:22</a>

<p><li>"And if it be on her bed, or on any thing whereon she sitteth, when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even." 
<a href="../lev/15.html#23">15:23</a>

<p><li>"If any man lie with her at all, and her flowers be upon him, he shall be unclean seven days; and all the bed whereon he lieth 
shall be unclean." <a href="../lev/15.html#24">15:24</a>

<p><li>"If a woman have an issue of her blood ... she shall be unclean." <a href="../lev/15.html#25">15:25</a>

<p><li>"Every bed whereon she lieth ... and whatsoever she sitteth upon shall be unclean." <a href="../lev/15.html#26">15:26</a>

<p><li>"Whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean." <a href="../lev/15.html#27">15:27</a>

<p><li>"But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean."<br>
Women are unclean while mestruating and for seven days after bleeding has stopped.  <a href="../lev/15.html#28">15:28</a>

<p><li>"On the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or two young pigeons ... for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement 
for her before the LORD for the issue of her uncleanness." <a href="../lev/15.html#29">15:29-30</a>

<p><li>"This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed goeth from him ... And of her that is sick of her flowers, 
and of him that hath an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean." 
<a href="../lev/15.html#32">15:32-33</a>

 <p><li>A man who has sex with a menstruating woman "shall be unclean seven days." 
 <a href="../lev/15.html#24">15:24</a>
 
 <p><li>"Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is
apart for her uncleanness," Don't even look at a menstruating woman. 
 <a href="../lev/18.html#19">18:19</a>

<p><li>Priests can't marry "whores", "profane", or divorced women. Why? Because "he is holy
unto his God" and they would defile him.  <a href="../lev/21.html#7">21:7</a>

    shall not offer these unto the LORD ... Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or crushed, or
    broken, or cut."<br>
God wants us to kill lots of animals for him. Not just any animals, though. God only wants dead, male animals without any blemishes. Don't 
kill any blind , broken, maimed, or scabbed, or female animials for him. <a href="../lev/22.html#19">22:19-24</a>

<p><li>God defines the value of human life in dollars and cents. Of course, to God, females
are worth considerably less than males (50 - 60%) -- but neither are worth much.

<p><li>The Law of Jealousies. If a man suspects his wife of being unfaithful, he reports it to the priest. The priest then
makes her drink some "bitter water." If she is guilty, the water makes her thigh rot and her belly swell. If innocent, no harm
done -- the woman is free and will "conceive seed." In any case, "the man shall be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman shall
bear her iniquity."  <a href="../num/5.html#11">5:11-31</a>

<p><li>Miriam and Aaron (Moses' brother and sister) criticize Moses for marrying an Ethiopian woman and thus breaking
the law of God. But God makes it clear that his rules 
don't apply to his favorites, and he strikes Miriam with leprosy. Notice that 
only Miriam is punished, though both she and Aaron complained.&nbsp;  
<a href="../num/12.html#1">12:1, 9-10</a>

<p><li>When one of the Israelite men brings home a foreign woman, "Phinehas (Aaron's grandson) sees them and throws a spear "through the man .. and the woman through her belly."
This act pleases God so much that "the plague was stayed from the children of Israel." But not before 
24,000 had died.  <a href="../num/25.html#6">25:6-9</a>

<p><li>For impaling the interracial couple, God rewards Phinehas and his sons with the everlasting 
priesthood. <a href="../num/25.html#10">25:10-13</a>

<p><li>If a man dies and has no son, then his inheritance goes to his daughter. But if he has a son, then the daughter gets
nothing. Also no mention is made of wives, sisters, or aunts.  <a href="../num/27.html#8">27:8</a>

<p><li>If men make vows, then God expects them to keep them. But a woman cannot make a vow, unless it is "allowed" by
her husband or father. If it is "allowed," then she must keep it -- but even so, she is not responsible 
(her husband or father is). <a href="../num/30.html#3">30:3-16</a>

<p><li>Under God's direction, Moses' army defeats the Midianites. They kill all the adult males, but take the women and
children captive. When Moses learns that they left some live, he angrily says: "Have you saved all the women alive? Kill
every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. But all the women children,
that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves." So they went back and did as Moses (and
presumably God) instructed, killing everyone except for the virgins. In this way they got 32,000 virgins -- Wow!

<p><li> If a man marries, then decides that he hates his wife, he can claim she wasn't a virgin when they were married. If
her father can't produce the "tokens of her virginity" (bloody sheets), then the woman is to be stoned to death at her father's
doorstep.  <a href="../dt/22.html#13">22:13-21</a>

<p><li>"If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband, then they shall both of them die." 
<a href="../dt/22.html#22">22:22</a>

<p><li>If a man marries a woman and later finds "some uncleanness in her," then he can divorce her and kick her out of his

<p><li>If a man dies without having a child, his brother shall "go in unto" his dead brother's wife -- whether she likes him or

God keeps his end of the deal by providing Jephthah with "a very great slaughter." But when Jephthah returns, his

<p><li>After taking in a traveling Levite, the host offers his virgin daughter and his guest's concubine to a mob of
perverts (who want to have sex with his guest). The mob refuses the daughter, but accepts the concubine and they
"abuse her all night." The next morning she crawls back to the doorstep and dies. The Levite puts her dead body on an
ass and takes her home. Then he chops her body up into twelve pieces and sends them to each of the twelve tribes of
Israel.  <a href="../jg/19.html#22">19:22-30</a>

<p><li>After the Israelites heard the Levite's story (about chopping up his dead concubine and sending her body parts to each 
tribe of Israel) they vowed not to "give" their daughters to the Benjamites. So now they had a problem: they just finished 
killing all the Benjamite women and children (<a href="../jg/20.html#48">Jg 20:48</a>) so there were no women for the surviving Benjamite men to marry. 
[There were 600 Benjamite men that survived the war with the Israelites. (<a href="../jg/20.html#47">Jg 20:47</a>)]  
<a href="../jg/21.html#1">21:1-7</a>  

<p><li>To find wives for the Benjamites (they were unwilling to use their own daughters), the other tribes attacked
and killed all occupants of a city except for the young virgins. These virgins were then given to the Benjamites for
wives.  <a href="../jg/21.html#7">21:7-23</a>

<p><li>Here's what the Israelites decide to do. They will go and kill everyone in Jabeshgilead except for the virgin 
women and give them to the 600 surviving Benjamites. <a href="../jg/21.html#11">21:11</a>

<p><li>So the Israelites killed all the non-virgin women and children in Jabeshgilead, bringing back 400 virgin women 
to give to the Benjamites. But they were still 200 short. Damn! <a href="../jg/21.html#12">21:12-14</a>

<p><li>Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are 
destroyed out of Benjamin?" <a href="../jg/21.html#16">21:16</a>

<p><li>"We may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that 
giveth a wife to Benjamin." <a href="../jg/21.html#18">21:18</a>

<p><li>So they come up with another brilliant plan. Have the Benjamites hide in the bushes and then catch the daughters 
of Shiloh when they come out to dance. So that's what they did and everyone lived happily ever after.  <a href="../jg/21.html#19">21:19-23</a>

<p><li>The priest tells David that he and his men can eat the "hallowed" bread if "they have kept themselves at least

with her "for she was purified from her uncleanness." She conceives and bears a son (of course).  
<a href="../2sam/11.html#2">11:2-5</a>

<p><li>David tells Joab (his captain) to send Bathsheba's husband (Uriah) to "the forefront of the hottest battle
... that he may be smitten and die." In this way, David gets another wife.  <a href="../2sam/11.html#15">11:15</a>,

<p><li>God gave the wives of King Saul to David. <a href="../2sam/12.html#7">12:7-8</a>

<p><li>God is angry at David for having Uriah killed. As a punishment, he will have David's wives raped by his
neighbor while everyone else watches. It turns out that the "neighbor" that God sends to do his dirty work is David's
own son, Absalom (<a href="../2sam/16.html#22">16:22</a>).  <a href="../2sam/12.html#11">12:11-12</a>

<p><li>To punish David for having Uriah killed, God kills Bathsheba's baby boy.  <a href="../2sam/12.html#14">12:14-18</a>

<p><li>After Bathsheba's baby is killed by God, David comforts her by going "in unto her." She conceives and bears
another son (Solomon).  <a href="../2sam/12.html#24">12:24</a>

<p><li>Ammon (David's son) says to his half-sister Tamar, "Come lie with me, my sister." But she resists, so he
rapes her and then sends her away. Tamar, knowing that she now belongs to him (since she was a virgin), expects him
to marry her, but he refuses.  <a href="../2sam/13.html#1">13:1-22</a>

<p><li>"And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house."</i><br>
David left Jerusalem because he was afraid that his son Absalom was going to kill him. But he left his 
concubines to fend for themselves.  <a href="../2sam/15.html#16">15:16</a>

<p><li>Absalom "went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel." This was according the God's plan
as announced in <a href="../2sam/12.html#11">12:11-12</a>.  <a href="../2sam/16.html#21">16:21-22</a>

<p><li>To punish his ten concubines for
being raped by his son, Absalom (See <a href="../2sam/16.html#21">16:21-22</a>), 
David refuses to ever again have sex with them and forces them to 
"keep house" for the rest of their lives. <a href="../2sam/20.html#3">20:3</a>

<p><li> Jerusalem is compared to a naked woman who sighs and turns backward. "Her filthiness is 
in her skirts." <a href="../lam/1.html#8">1:8-9</a>

<p><li>"The adversary puts his hand upon "all her pleasant things." <a href="../lam/1.html#10">1:10</a>

<p><li> God tramples "as in a winepress" mighty men, young men, and virgins. <a href="../lam/1.html#15">1:15</a>

<p><li>"Jerusalem is as a menstrous woman." (To God this is an insult.) <a href="../lam/1.html#17">1:17</a>

<p><li>"The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground." <a href="../lam/2.html#10">2:10</a></li></p>

<p><li>God mercilessly kills everyone, young and old. He even causes women to eat their children. <a href="../lam/2.html#20">2:20-22</a>

<p><li> God &quot;accomplishes his fury&quot; by making women eat their children. 
<a href="../lam/4.html#10">4:10-11</a>
<p><li> When God gets angry at you he calls you a drunken whore.  <a href="../lam/4.html#21">4:21</a>

<p><li> God sends a &quot;man clothed with linen&quot; to mark the foreheads of the men who will be 
saved. Apparently only men are considered good enough to keep, the others (unmarked 
men, &quot;maids&quot;, little children, and women) are to be slaughtered. God says 
he'll &quot;fill the courts with the slain&quot; and will have pity on no 
one. <a href="../ezek/9.html#4">9:4-11</a>

<p><li>"Woe to the woman that sew pillows ... Behold, I am against your 
pillows." (God likes neither woman nor pillows.) <a href="../ezek/13.html#18">13:18-21</a>

<p><li>God dresses up Jerusalem, 
cleans off the blood that  she was wallowing in, and compliments her on her nice hair 
and breasts.  <a href="../ezek/16.html#6">16:6-7, 22</a>

<p><li>Jerusalem was a harlot who had sex with everyone that passed by. If no one was available, she "committed whoredom" with "images of men."
 <a href="../ezek/16.html#15">16:15-17</a>

<p><li>"Thou ... hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by." <a href="../ezek/16.html#25">16:25</a>

<p><li>"Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, great of flesh." (Jerusalem 
had sex with Egyptians with big penises.) <a href="../ezek/16.html#26">16:26</a>

<p><li>Jerusalem still wasn't satisfied after having sex with the the well-endowed Egyptians (v.26), so she had sex with Assyrians, Canaanites, Chaldeans, 
and complete strangers, but still was not satisfied. So she hired men to "come in unto [her] on every side." <a href="../ezek/16.html#28">16:28-29</a>

<p><li>God calls Jerusalem "an imperious whorish woman." <a href="../ezek/16.html#30">16:30</a>

<p><li>God says that Jerusalem has sex with strangers, hiring them to "come in unto thee on every side."
<a href="../ezek/16.html#32">16:32-33</a>

<p><li>Because she is such a filthy harlot, God will expose her nakedness 
before all of her lovers. <a href="../ezek/16.html#35">16:35-37</a>

<p><li>After exposing her nakedness, God will give her "blood in fury and jealousy" and strip her naked once more. 
Then he'll have her stoned "with stones and thrust through with swords." <a href="../ezek/16.html#38">16:38-41</a>

<p><li> A good man never gets near a menstruating
woman.  <a href="../ezek/18.html#5">18:5-6</a>

<p><li>"They humbled her that was set apart for pollution."</i> <br>
    (They had sex with a menstruating woman.) <a href="../ezek/22.html#10">22:10</a>

<p><li> Two sisters were guilty of &quot;committing whoredoms&quot; by pressing their breasts and 
bruising &quot;the teats of their virginity.&quot; As a punishment, one sister's nakedness was 
discovered, her children were taken from her, and she was killed by the sword. And the fate of the 
surviving sister was even worse: Her nose and ears were cut off, she was made to &quot;pluck off&quot; 
her own breasts, and then after being raped and mutilated, she is stoned to death. 
<a href="../ezek/23.html#1">23:1-49</a>

<p><li>"Their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity." <a href="../ezek/23.html#3">23:3</a>

<p><li>"Thus she committed her whoredoms with them ... with all their idols she defiled herself." <a href="../ezek/23.html#7">23:7</a>

<p><li>"They bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her." <a href="../ezek/23.html#8">23:8</a>

<p><li>"These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword." <a href="../ezek/23.html#10">23:10</a>

<p><li>"Her sister ... was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and
    in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms." <a href="../ezek/23.html#11">23:11</a>
    
<p><li>"And the Babylonians came
    to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom,
    and she was polluted with them." <a href="../ezek/23.html#17">23:17</a>  
    
<p><li>"So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness ... she multiplied her whoredoms." <a href="../ezek/23.html#18">23:18-19</a>

<p><li>Really Big Penises. One of the sister (Aholibah) had lovers
&quot;whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.&quot;
<a href="../ezek/23.html#20">23:20</a>
 
<p><li>"The lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth." <a href="../ezek/23.html#21">23:21</a>

<p><li>"They shall also strip
    thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels." <a href="../ezek/23.html#26">23:26</a>
    
<p><li>"I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen ... Thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in 
derision ... thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow." <a href="../ezek/23.html#30">23:30-33</a>  

<p><li>"Thou shalt ... pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD." <a href="../ezek/23.html#34">23:34</a>  

<p><li>"They came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and
    deckedst thyself with ornaments, And satest upon a stately bed." <a href="../ezek/23.html#40">23:40-41</a>
    
        <p><li>"They went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot." <a href="../ezek/23.html#44">23:44</a>
        
     <p><LI>"And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; 
    because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands." <a href="../ezek/23.html#45">23:45</a>       

<p><li>"Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught." <a href="../ezek/23.html#48">23:48</a>

<p><li>God gets all excited about cooking with "scum" and human flesh, saying "kindle the fire, consume the
flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned. Her scum shall be in the fire." <a href="../ezek/24.html#3">24:3-14</a>

<p><li> God kills Ezekiel's wife and then tells him not to mourn her.  <a href="../ezek/24.html#15">24:16-18</a>

<p><li> God says he will destroy Tyrus. He plans to kill everyone, but he is especially looking 
 forward to killing all of the women. "And her daughters  which are in the field shall be slain by the sword; and 
they shall know that I am the LORD." <a href="../ezek/26.html#1">26:1-21</a>

<p><li>The Israelites were like a menstruating women, so God poured his fury on them.  <a href="../ezek/36.html#17">36:17-18</a>

<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../hos/wom.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->
<p><li>God tells Hosea to commit adultery, saying "take ... a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms" because the land has "committed great
whoredom." So Hosea did as God commanded and "took" a wife named Gomer.  <a href="../hos/1.html#2">1:2-3</a>
  
<p><li> God (or Hosea?) tells his children that their mother is a whore who is not his wife. He asks 
them to tell their mother to "put away her whoredoms" and  "her adulteries from between her breasts" or 
he'll "strip her naked ... and slay her with thirst." <a href="../hos/2.html#2">2:2-3</a>

<p><li>God "will not have mercy upon ... the children of whoredoms. For their mother hath played the
harlot."  <a href="../hos/2.html#4">2:4-5</a>

<p><li> God says he "will discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers."  <a href="../hos/2.html#10">2:10</a>
  
<p><li>"She decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD." <a href="../hos/2.html#13">2:13</a>

<p><li>God tells Hosea to love an adulteress. (I thought he already did that in chapter 1.) In any case, Hosea buys (another?) one 
for a homer and a half of barley.  <a href="../hos/3.html#1">3:1-2</a>

<p><li>Committing whoredom by going a whoring with the spirit of whoredom. <a href="../hos/4.html#10">4:10</a>

<p><li>If you misbehave, God will make your daughters "commit whoredom" and your wife "commit 
adultery." </a> <a href="../hos/4.html#13">4:13</a>

<p><li> If you misbehave, God will make your daughters &quot;commit whoredom&quot; and your 
wife &quot;commit adultery.&quot;  </a><a href="../hos/4.html#13">4:13</a>

<p><li>"O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom." <a href="../hos/5.html#3">5:3</a>

<p><li>"The spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them." <a href="../hos/5.html#4">5:4</a>

<p><li> Israel has &quot;gone a whoring&quot; and has &quot;loved a reward upon every cornfloor.&quot; <a href="../hos/9.html#1">9:1</a>
<p><li> God will induce miscarriages and kill the children of Ephraim. <a href="../hos/9.html#11">9:11-12</a>
<p><li>"O Lord: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.&quot;
  <a href="../hos/9.html#14">9:14</a>
<p><li> "I will slay even the beloved fruit of their womb.&quot; <a href="../hos/9.html#16">9:16</a>
<p><li>God will punish Israel by "dashing" together mothers and their children.
 <a href="../hos/10.html#14">10:14</a>
<p><li>Because the Samaritans chose to worship another deity, God will dash their infants to pieces and 
their &quot;women with child shall be ripped up.&quot;&nbsp;<a href="../hos/13.html#16">13:16</a>
