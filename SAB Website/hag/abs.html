<p><li> It sounds so much more prophet-like when we are told the year, month, and day of some prophetic nonsense. 
<a href="1.html#1">1:1, 15</a>,  <a href="2.html#1">2:1, 10, 18, 20</a>

<p><li>God wanted a nice, fancy house to take pleasure in and be glorified in. <a href="1.html#8">1:8</a>

<p><li> But the Israelites repaired their own houses while ignoring the temple. So God huffed, and he puffed, and he blew on the land, 
thereby bringing a drought to punish them. <a href="1.html#9">1:9-11</a>

<p><li> A whole lot of shaking going on.<br>
God will shake the heavens, the earth, sea, and dry land. He'll shake until "the desire of the nations" comes and his house is filled with glory. 
<a href="2.html#6">2:6-7, 21</a>

<p><li> God will have more glory than ever when he is settled into his new house, and he might even give some peace. <a href="2.html#9">2:9</a>

<p><li>God has a conversation with Haggai and the priests about holy flesh, skirts touching bread or wine, the cleanliness of dead bodies, and whatnot. 
The main thing to remember here is this: Don't let your holy flesh touch any food or wine, because if you do your flesh won't be holy any more.
<a href="2.html#11">2:11-14</a>

<p><li>God sent blight and hail upon the Israelites, yet they still didn't return to him. What is wrong with people?
 <a href="2.html#17">2:17</a>
 
 <p><li> Consider this: "Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, 
 even from the day that the foundation of the LORD's temple was laid, consider it." <a href="2.html#18">2:18</a>
