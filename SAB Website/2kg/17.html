  In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to
    reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="2">17:2</A></B>
  And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as the
    kings of Israel that were before him.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="3">17:3</A></B>
  Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his
    servant, and gave him presents.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="4">17:4</A></B>
  And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent
    messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of
    Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him
    up, and bound him in prison.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">    
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="5">17:5</A></B>
  Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to
    Samaria, and besieged it three years.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="6">17:6</A></B>
  In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried
    Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river
    of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="7">17:7</A></B>
  For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD
    their God, which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under
    the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="8">17:8</A></B>
  And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from
    before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they had
    made.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="9">17:9</A></B>
  And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not right
    against the LORD their God, and they built them high places in all their
    cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="10">17:10</A></B>
  And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every
    green tree:<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="11">17:11</A></B>
  And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the heathen
    whom the LORD carried away before them; and wrought wicked things to provoke
    the LORD to anger:<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  For they served idols, whereof the LORD had said unto them, Ye shall not

  <tr><td><B><A name="13">17:13</A></B>
  Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the
    prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and
    keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I
    commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="14">17:14</A></B>
  Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the
    neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their God.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="15">17:15</A></B>
  And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their
    fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they
    followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that were round
    about them, concerning whom the LORD had charged them, that they should not
    do like them.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="16">17:16</A></B>
  And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made them
    molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the
    host of heaven, and served Baal.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="17">17:17</A></B>
  And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire,
    and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the
    sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
   <tr><td><B><A name="18">17:18</A></B>
  Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his
    sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="19">17:19</A></B>
  Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in
    the statutes of Israel which they made.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and
    delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his
    sight.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="21">17:21</A></B>
  For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son
    of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the LORD, and made
    them sin a great sin.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  Until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his

  And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and

    cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed
    Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the LORD,
