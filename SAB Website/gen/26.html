(26:1) <i>"Isaac went unto Abimelech  king of the Philistines"</i><br>Isaac visits the king of the 
Philistines &quot;in the days of Abraham&quot;, yet the 
 Philistines didn't live in the region until&nbsp; around 1200 BCE (800 years after &quot;the days of 
 Abraham&quot;).
 
 <p><img src="../images/contra1.gif"> (26:2) <i>"And the Lord appeared unto him."</i><br>
<a href="../contra/seen.html">Can God be seen?</a>

<p><img src="../images/pr1.gif" >

 <img src="../images/contra1.gif"> (26:4) <i>"I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven ... and in thy seed shall 
 all the nations of the earth be blessed."</i><br>     
God promises to make Isaac's descendents as numerous as "the stars of heaven", which, of course, never happened. The Jews 
have always been, and will always be, a small minority. <br>
<a href="../contra/jews_many.html">Will there be many Jews?</a>

   because she was fair to look upon."</i><br>   
Isaac uses the same "she's my sister" lie that his father used so effectively with the Pharaoh and the same king Abimelech. 
(<a href="../gen/12.html#13">Genesis 12:13</a>, <a href="../gen/20.html#2">20:2</a>). And Isaac grew rich 
from the lie, just like his father had. (You'd think Abimelech wouldn't fall for the same 
stupid lie twice. But, hey, this is the Bible!)

<p><img src="../images/sex1.gif" >  (26:8) <i>"Abimelech ... looked out at a window, and saw ... Isaac ... sporting with Rebekah."</i><br>
The king looked out his window, and saw Isaac "sporting" with Rebekah. 

<p><img src="../images/inj1.gif" > 
  <img src="../images/interp.gif"  > (26:12-14) <br>
God blessed Isaac (like his father Abraham before him) with many slaves.<br>
  <a href="../contra/slavery.html">Does God approve of slavery?</a>
