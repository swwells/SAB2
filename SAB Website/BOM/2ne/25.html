<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (25:1) <i>"Now I, Nephi, do speak somewhat concerning the words which I have written, 
which have been spoken by the mouth of Isaiah."</i><br>
Nephi speaks (somewhat) about the 13 chapters that he stole from Isaiah. (<a href="11.html">2 Nephi 11</a>-<a href="24.html">24</a>)

<p><img src="../../images/inj1.gif" >

</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>25:1</b><span class="a">   Now I, Nephi, do speak somewhat 
	</span>concerning the words which I have written, which have 
been spoken by the mouth of Isaiah.  For behold, Isaiah spake many things which were hard for many of my people to 
understand; for they know not concerning the manner of prophesying among the Jews. 

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>25:2</b>   For I, Nephi, have not taught them many things concerning the manner of 
	<b> <span class="i">the 
Jews; for their works were works of darkness, and their doings were doings of abominations.</span></b>

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>25:3</b>   Wherefore, I write unto my people, unto all those that shall receive hereafter 
these things which I write, that they may know the judgments of God, that they come upon all nations, according to the 
word which he hath spoken. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>25:4</b>   Wherefore, hearken, O my people, which are of the house of Israel, and give ear unto 
my words; for because <span class="a">the words of Isaiah are not plain unto you, nevertheless they are plain unto all those that are 
filled with the spirit of prophecy.</span>  But I give unto you a prophecy, according to the spirit which is in me; wherefore<span class="a"> 
I shall prophesy according to the plainness which hath been with me</span> from the time that I came out from Jerusalem with 
my father; for behold, <span class="a">my soul delighteth in plainness unto my people</span>, that they may learn.

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (25:4) <i>"The words of Isaiah are not plain unto you, 
nevertheless they are plain unto all those that are filled with the spirit of prophecy ... My soul delighteth in plainness unto my people."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" >
<img src="../../images/plag.gif" > (25:5a) <i>"My soul delighteth in the words of Isaiah,"</i><br>
That's probably why he included 13 consecutive chapters from Isaiah. (2 Nephi 12-24)

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (25:5b) <i>"The Jews do understand the things of the prophets, 
and there is none other people that understand the things which were spoken unto the Jews like unto them, save it be 
that they are taught after the manner of the things of the Jews."</i><br>
To understand the prophets correctly you've got to be "taught after the manner of the things of the Jews" 
(Like early 19th century Americans).

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (25:7) <i>"Behold, I proceed with mine own prophecy, according to my plainness."</i> 

</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>25:5</b>   Yea, and <span class="a">my soul delighteth in the words of Isaiah</span>, for I came out from Jerusalem, 
and mine eyes hath beheld the things of the Jews, and I know that 
	<span class="a">the Jews do understand the things of the prophets, 
and there is none other people that understand the things which were spoken unto the Jews like unto them, save it be 
that they are taught after the manner of the things of the Jews. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>25:6</b>   But behold, I, Nephi, have not taught my children after the manner of the Jews; but 
behold, I, of myself, have dwelt at Jerusalem, wherefore I know concerning the regions round about; and I have made 
mention unto my children concerning the judgments of God, which hath come to pass among the Jews, unto my children, 
according to all that which Isaiah hath spoken, and I do not write them. 

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>25:7</b>   But <span class="a">behold, I proceed with mine own prophecy, according to my plainness</span>; in the 
which I know that no man can err; nevertheless, in the days that the prophecies of Isaiah shall be fulfilled men shall 
know of a surety, at the times when they shall come to pass. 

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>25:8</b>   Wherefore, they are of worth unto the children of men, and he that supposeth that 
they are not, unto them will I speak particularly, and confine the words unto mine own people; for I know that they shall
