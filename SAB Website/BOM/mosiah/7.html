<a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a> (7:1, 2, 3, 8, 14, 17, 18)

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (7:1-3) The first three years of King Mosiah's reign were peaceful.  
But he was getting a little bored, and was wondering about his brethren who had left Zarahemla years ago.   
So he sent 16 of his finest men to the land of Lehi-Nephi to go looking for them.  Ammon (a strong and mighty man) was their leader. 

<p>(7:1) <i>"After King Mosiah had had continual peace for the space of three years, he was desirous to 
know concerning the people who went up to dwell in the land of Lehi-Nephi, or in the city of Lehi-Nephi; for his people ... wearied 
him with their teasings."</i>

<p>(7:2) <i>"King Mosiah granted that sixteen of their strong men might go up to the land of Lehi-Nephi to inquire concerning their brethren."</i>

<p>(7:3) <i>"On the morrow they started to go up, having with them one Ammon, he being a strong and mighty man ... 
and he was also their leader."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (7:4-5) After 40 days of wandering around, they set up camp on a hill north of Shilom, 
in the land of Nephi.  

<p>(7:4) <i>"They knew not the course they should travel in the wilderness to go up to the land of Lehi-Nephi; 
therefore they wandered many days in the wilderness, even forty days did they wander."</i>

<p>(7:5) <i>"They came to a hill, which is north of the land of Shilom, and there they pitched their tents."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (7:6-7) The next morning, Ammon and three of his best men went down into the land of Nephi to explore.  
They promptly got thrown in jail by the king's guard.

<p>(7:6) <i>"And Ammon took three of his brethren ... into the land of Nephi."</i>

<p>(7:7) <i>"And behold ... they were surrounded by the king's guard, and were taken, and were bound, and were committed to prison."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (7:8-11) After two days in jail, the king brought them out for questioning.  He told them that 
he was Limhi (the son of Noah, who was the son of Zeniff, who came up out of the land of Zarahemla) and then asked them to explain 
why they were there, or else be put to death.  Seems fair. 

<p>(7:8) <i>"When they had been in prison two days they were again brought before the king ...and were permitted, or rather commanded, 
that they should answer the questions which he should ask them."</i>

<p>(7:9) <i>"And he said ... Behold, I am Limhi, the son of Noah, who was the son of Zeniff, who came up out of the land of 
Zarahemla."</i>

<p>(7:11) <i>"I suffered that ye should be preserved, that I might inquire of you, 
or else ... put you to death."</i>

	<span class="a">when they had been in prison two days they were again brought

<tr><td><b><a name="9">7:9</a></b> <span class="a">And he said</span> unto them: 
	<span class="a">Behold, I am Limhi, the son of Noah, who was the son of Zeniff, who came up out 
of the land of Zarahemla</span> to inherit this land, which was the land of their fathers, who was made a king by the voice of 
the people. 

<tr><td><b><a name="10">7:10</a></b>   And now, I desire to know the cause whereby ye were so bold as to come near the walls of the city, 
when I, myself, was with my guards without the gate? 

<tr><td><b><a name="11">7:11</a></b>   And now, for this cause have 
	<span class="a">I suffered that ye should be preserved, that I might inquire of you, or

	<span class="a">bowed</span> himself before the king; 
<span class="a">and</span> rising again he <span class="a">said: O king, I am very thankful before God this day that I am yet alive, and am permitted to 
speak</span>; and I will endeavor to speak with boldness; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (7:12) <i>"Ammon ... bowed ... and ... said: O king, I am very thankful before God this day that I am yet alive, 
and am permitted to speak."</i><br>
Ammon bows and thanks King Limhi for not already killing him, and for letting him explain himself.  There is so much to be thankful for!
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="13">7:13</a></b>   For I am assured that if ye had known me ye would not have suffered that I should have worn these 
bands.  For <span class="a">I am Ammon</span>, and am a descendant of Zarahemla, 
	<span class="a">and have come up out of the land of Zarahemla to inquire 
concerning our brethren, whom Zeniff brought up out of that land. </span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee" rowspan="7" valign="top">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (7:13-15) After Ammon tells his story, Lemhi is pleased. His people are being forced to pay a 
high tribute to the Lamenites, and he figures that his long-lost brethren in Zarahemla will help him out of the mess.

<p>(7:13) <i>"I am Ammon ... and have come up out of the land of Zarahemla to inquire concerning our brethren, 
whom Zeniff brought up out of that land."</i>

<p>(7:14) <i>"Limhi ... was <a href="exceed_list.html">exceedingly</a> glad, and said: Now, I know 
of a surety that my brethren who were in the land of Zarahemla are yet alive."</i>

<p>(7:15) <i>"We are in bondage to the Lamanites, and are taxed with a tax ... [If] our brethren will deliver us out of our bondage ... 
we will be their slaves; for it is better that we be slaves to the Nephites than to pay tribute to the king of the Lamanites."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (7:16) <i>"Limhi commanded his guards that they should no more bind 
Ammon nor his brethren, but ... bring their brethren into the city, that thereby they might eat, and drink, 
and rest themselves."</i><br>
So King Lemhi set Ammon and his men free, and allowed them to eat, drink and rest in the city.  He even sent a few guards 
to collect the rest of the men who were still camping on the hill.

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (7:17-18) Then King Lemhi sent a proclamation to all his people, telling them to gather 
together for a speech (oh boy!).  Once everyone gathers around, he gives them the good news: 
"The time is at hand, or is not far distant, when we shall no longer be in subjection to our enemies."

<p>(7:17) <i>"King Limhi sent a proclamation among all his people, that thereby 
they might gather themselves together to the temple to hear the words which he should speak unto them."</i>

<p>(7:18) <i>"He spake ... saying: ... the time is at hand, or is not far distant, when we shall no longer be in 
subjection to our enemies."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif">
<img src="../../images/boring.jpg">  (7:19-33) He then preaches for a little while about how the tribute was their 
fault in the first place; that it was a punishment sent from the Lord because of their iniquity.  Luckily, 
God is now giving them a second chance. 

<p>(7:19) <i>"Therefore, lift up your heads, and rejoice, and put your trust in God, in that God who was the God of Abraham, and Isaac, 
and Jacob......"</i>

<tr><td><b><a name="14">7:14</a></b>   And now, <span class="a">it came to pass</span> that after 
	<span class="a">Limhi</span> had heard the words of Ammon, he 
	<span class="a">was exceedingly glad, and said: Now, I know of a surety that my brethren who were in the land of Zarahemla are yet alive.</span>  And now, I will rejoice; and on the morrow I will cause that my people shall rejoice also. 

<tr><td><b><a name="15">7:15</a></b>   For behold, <span class="a">we are in bondage to the Lamanites, and are taxed with a tax</span> which is grievous to be 
borne.  And now, behold, <span class="a">our brethren will deliver us out of our bondage</span>, or out of the hands of the Lamanites, and 
	<span class="a">we will be their slaves; for it is better that we be slaves to the Nephites than to pay tribute to the king of the Lamanites.
	</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="16">7:16</a></b>   And now, king <span class="a">Limhi commanded his guards that they should no more bind Ammon nor his brethren, but</span> 
caused that they should go to the hill which was north of Shilom, and 
	<span class="a">bring their brethren into the city, that thereby 
they might eat, and drink, and rest themselves</span> from the labors of their journey; for they had suffered many things; 
they had suffered hunger, thirst, and fatigue. 

<tr><td><b><a name="17">7:17</a></b>   And now, <span class="a">it came to pass</span> on the morrow that 
	<span class="a">king Limhi sent a proclamation among all his people, that 
thereby they might gather themselves together to the temple to hear the words which he should speak unto them.
	</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="18">7:18</a></b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when they had gathered themselves together that 
	<span class="a">he spake</span> unto them in this wise, <span class="a">saying</span>: O ye, my people, lift up your heads and be comforted; for behold, 
	<span class="a">the time is at 
hand, or is not far distant, when we shall no longer be in subjection to our enemies</span>, notwithstanding our many strugglings, which have been in vain; yet I trust there remaineth an effectual struggle to be made. 

<tr><td><b><a name="19">7:19</a></b> <span class="a">Therefore, lift up your heads, and rejoice, and put your trust in God, in that God who was the God of 
Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob</span>; and also, that God who brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, and 
caused that they should walk through the Red Sea on dry ground, and fed them with manna that they might not perish in 
the wilderness; and many more things did he do for them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20">7:20</a></b>   And again, that same God has brought our fathers out of the land of Jerusalem, and has kept and 
preserved his people even until now; and behold, it is because of our iniquities and abominations that he has brought 
us into bondage. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21">7:21</a></b>   And ye all are witnesses this day, that Zeniff, who was made king over this people, he being 
over-zealous to inherit the land of his fathers, therefore being deceived by the cunning and craftiness of king 
Laman, who having entered into a treaty with king Zeniff, and having yielded up into his hands the possessions of 
a part of the land, or even the city of Lehi-Nephi, and the city of Shilom; and the land round about --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="22">7:22</a></b>   And all this he did, for the sole purpose of bringing this people into subjection or into bondage.  And 
behold, <span class="a">we</span> at this time do <span class="a">pay</span> tribute to the king of the Lamanites, to the amount of 
	<span class="a">one half of</span> our corn, 
<span class="sci"> and our barley, and even all our grain of every kind</span>, and one half of the increase of our flocks and our herds; and even one 
half of all we have or possess the king of the Lamanites doth exact of us, or our lives. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/sci1.gif" > (7:22) <i>"We ... pay ... to the king of the Lamanites ... one half of 
... our barley, and even 
our grain of every kind."</i><br>
The Nephites had to hand over half of their barley to the Lamanites. But that wouldn't have been a big deal 
since barley didn't exist in the New World at the time.

<tr><td><b><a name="23">7:23</a></b>   And now, is not this grievous to be borne?  And is not this, our affliction, great?  Now behold, how 
great reason we have to mourn. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24">7:24</a></b>   Yea, I say unto you, great are the reasons which we have to mourn; for behold how many of our brethren 
have been slain, and their blood has been spilt in vain, and all because of iniquity. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25">7:25</a></b>   <span class="a">For if this people had not fallen into transgression the Lord would not have suffered that this great

<tr><td><b><a name="26">7:26</a></b>   And a prophet of the Lord have they slain; yea, a chosen man of God, who told them of their wickedness

<tr><td><b><a name="27">7:27</a></b>   And because he said unto them that Christ was the God, the Father of all things, and said that he 
should take upon him the image of man, and it should be the image after which man was created in the beginning; or in 
other words, he said that man was created after the image of God, and that God should come down among the children of 
men, and take upon him flesh and blood, and go forth upon the face of the earth --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="28">7:28</a></b>   And now, because he said this, they did put him to death; and many more things did they do which brought 
down the wrath of God upon them.  Therefore, who wondereth that they are in bondage, and that they are smitten with sore 
afflictions? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="29">7:29</a></b>   For behold, the Lord hath said: I will not succor my people in the day of their transgression; but I

<tr><td><b><a name="30">7:30</a></b>   And again, he saith: If my people shall sow filthiness <span class="plag">they shall reap the chaff
