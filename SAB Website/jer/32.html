<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="1">32:1</A></B>
  The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah
    king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="2">32:2</A></B>
  For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the
    prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the king of
    Judah's house.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="3">32:3</A></B>
  For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou
    prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into
    the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="4">32:4</A></B>
  And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the
    Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of
    Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold
    his eyes;<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="5">32:5</A></B>
  And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit
    him, saith the LORD: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not
    prosper.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="6">32:6</A></B>
  And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  
  <tr><td><B><A name="7">32:7</A></B>
  Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee
    saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth: for the right of redemption
    is thine to buy it.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="8">32:8</A></B>
  So Hanameel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison
    according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray
    thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin: for the
    right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for
    thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="9">32:9</A></B>
  And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that was in Anathoth,
    and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="10">32:10</A></B>
  And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and
    weighed him the money in the balances.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="11">32:11</A></B>
  So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed
    according to the law and custom, and that which was open:<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="12">32:12</A></B>
  And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the

    presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before
    all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="13">32:13</A></B>
  And I charged Baruch before them, saying,<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  
  <tr><td><B><A name="14">32:14</A></B>
  Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences,
    this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which
    is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many
    days.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
