<p><li>Jesus believed the stupid and vicious story from <a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/num/21.html#4">Numbers 21</a>. 
(God sent snakes to bite the people for complaining about the lack of food and water. 
Then God told Moses to make a brass snake to cure them from the bites.)  <a href="3.html#14">3:14</a>

<p><li>"God so loved the world, that he gave his His only begotten Son."<br>
As an example to parents everywhere and to save the world (from himself), God had his own son tortured and killed. <a href="3.html#16">3:16</a>
 
<p><li>People are damned or saved depending only on what they believe. <a href="3.html#18">3:18</a>, 
<a href="3.html#36">36</a>

<p><li>The "wrath of God" is on all unbelievers.  <a href="3.html#36">3:36</a>

<p><li>Jesus believes people are crippled by God as a punishment for sin. He tells a crippled man, after healing him, to
"sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee."  <a href="5.html#14">5:14</a>

<p><li>Those who do not believe in Jesus will be cast into a fire to be burned.  <a href="15.html#6">15:6</a>

<p><li>Jesus says we must eat his flesh and drink his blood if we want to have eternal life. This idea was just too gross for &quot;many of his disciples&quot; and &quot;walked no more 
with him.&quot; (They are called Protestants nowadays.) <a href="6.html#53">6:53-66</a>
