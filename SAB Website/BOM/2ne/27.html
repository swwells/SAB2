<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/plag.gif" > Nephi got tired of his own tiresome words, so he went back to quoting Isaiah again.

<p>But this time, it's not just filler. Isaiah 29 is selected because it refers to a special book, sealed by God, that the wise and learned 
cannot understand. Only one very special person will be able to read it. The book is the Book of Mormon, "a marvelous work and a wonder," 
and the very special person is Joseph Smith. The book of Mormon prophesies itself -- 2400 years before it was found and translated by 
Joseph Smith!

<p>(27:2) Thou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with
    earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of
    devouring fire. -- <a href="../../is/29.html#6">Isaiah 29:6</a>

nations of the Gentiles and also the Jews, both those who shall come upon this land and those who shall be upon other 
lands, yea, even upon all the lands of the earth, behold, they will be drunken with iniquity and all manner of 
abominations --  

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>27:2</b>   And when that day shall come they 
  <span class="plag">shall be visited of the Lord of Hosts, with

fire. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>27:3</b>   And all the nations that fight against Zion, and that distress her, shall be as a 
dream of a night vision; yea, it shall be unto them, even as unto a hungry man which dreameth, and behold he eateth but 
he awaketh and his soul is empty; or like unto a thirsty man which dreameth, and behold he drinketh but he awaketh 
and behold he is faint, and his soul hath appetite; yea, even so shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight 
against Mount Zion. 

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>27:4</b>   For behold, all ye that doeth iniquity,
