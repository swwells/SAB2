  There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman
    careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in
    spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she
    may please her husband.

  But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin,
    if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he
    will, he sinneth not: let them marry.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="37">7:37</A></B>  Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity,

  So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her
    not in marriage doeth better.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="39">7:39</A></B>
  The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her
    husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in
    the Lord.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="40">7:40</A></B>
  But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also
    that I have the Spirit of God.
