They said: We are lords of might and lords of great prowess, but it is for thee  to command; so consider what thou wilt command. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><a NAME="40"><b>27:40</a></b>
One with whom was knowledge of the Scripture said: I will bring it thee  before thy gaze returneth unto thee. And when he saw it set in his presence,  (Solomon) said: This is of the bounty of my Lord, that He may try me whether I give  thanks or am ungrateful. Whosoever giveth thanks he only giveth thanks for (the good  of) his own soul; and whosoever is ungrateful (is ungrateful only to his own soul's  hurt). For lo! my Lord is Absolute in independence, Bountiful. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="41"><b>27:41</a></b>
He said: Disguise her throne for her that we may see whether she will go  aright or be of those not rightly guided. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

So, when she came, it was said (unto her): Is thy throne like this ? She said:  (It is) as though it were the very one. And (Solomon said): We were given the  knowledge before her and we had surrendered (to Allah). <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="43"><b>27:43</a></b>
And (all) that she was wont to worship instead of Allah hindered her, for she  came of disbelieving folk. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="44"><b>27:44</a></b>
It was said unto her: Enter the hall. And when she saw it she deemed it a  pool and bared her legs. (Solomon) said: Lo! it is a hall, made smooth, of glass. She  said: My Lord! Lo! I have wronged myself, and I surrender with Solomon unto Allah,  the Lord of the Worlds. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="45"><b>27:45</a></b>
And We verily sent unto Thamud their brother Salih, saying: Worship Allah.  And lo! they (then  became two parties quarrelling. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="46"><b>27:46</a></b>
He said: O my people! Why will ye hasten on the evil rather than the good ?  Why will ye not ask pardon of Allah, that ye may receive mercy. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><a NAME="47"><b>27:47</a></b>
They said: We augur evil of thee and those with thee. He said: Your evil  augury is with Allah. Nay, but ye are folk that are being tested. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="48"><b>27:48</a></b>
And there were in the city nine persons who made mischief in the land and  reformed not. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="49"><b>27:49</a></b>
They said: Swear one to another by Allah that we verily will attack him and  his household by night, and afterward we will surely say unto his friend: We  witnessed not the destruction of his household. And lo! we are truthtellers. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="50"><b>27:50</a></b>
So they plotted a plot: and We plotted a plot, while they perceived not. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Then see the nature of the consequence of their plotting, for lo! <span class="v">We

<span class="i">And we saved those who believed</span> and used to ward off (evil). <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
