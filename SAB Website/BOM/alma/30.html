"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",
"<span class='i'>Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever.</span>--<a href='3.html#14'>Alma 3:14</a>",
"<span class='i'>I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</span>--<a href='3.html#15'>Alma 3:15</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",
"<span class='a'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges ... even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year....</span>--<a href='16.html#1'>Alma 16:1</a>",
"<span class='a'>Their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.</span>--<a href='16.html#11'>Alma 16:11</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",
"<span class='v'>He [Ammon] smote off their arms with his sword; for he did withstand their blows by smiting their arms with the edge of his sword.</span>--<a href='17.html#37'>Alma 17:37</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.   Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</span>--<a href='30.html#22'>Alma 30:22</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",
"<span class='i'>God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.</span>--<a href='30.html#47'>Alma 30:47</a>",
"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Amalekites were of a more wicked and murderous disposition than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='43.html#6'>Alma 43:6</a>",

"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",
"<span class='i'>These dissenters ... became ... more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='47.html#36'>Alma 47:36</a>",
"<span class='a'>God would prosper them in the land, or in other words ... God ... would prosper them in the land.</span>--<a href='48.html#15'>Alma 48:15</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='50.html#22'>Alma 50:22</a>",
"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",
"<span class='i'>The remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty.</span>--<a href='51.html#20'>Alma 51:20</a>",
"<span class='g'>And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye.</span>--<a href='54.html#21'>Alma 54:21</a>",
"<span class='v'>We did slay upwards of two thousand of them after they had surrendered themselves prisoners of war.</span>--<a href='57.html#14'>Alma 57:14</a>",

mourning, and prayer, (and it was in the sixteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi) there

 spoken by the prophets, concerning the coming of Christ. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>30:7</b>   <span class="g">Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to

 Ammon, who were once the people of the Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>30:20</b>   But behold they were more wise than many of the Nephites; for they took him, and bound him, and

 <tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>30:21</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that he caused that he should be carried out of the

 land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>30:22</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the high priest said unto him: Why do ye go about

Korihor says that the Nephites don't know that Christ will come, or that he will be killed for the

 own hands for my support, notwithstanding my many travels round about the land to declare the word of God unto 
 my people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="33"></a>30:33</b>   And notwithstanding the many labors which I have performed in the church, I have never received

 then we have received only according to law for our time. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
<tr><td><b><a name="34"></a>30:34</b>   And now, if we do not receive anything for our labors in the church, what doth it profit us to labor 
in the church save it were to declare the truth, that we may have rejoicings in the joy of our brethren? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="35"></a>30:35</b>   Then why sayest thou that we preach unto this people to get gain, when thou, of thyself, knowest 
that we receive no gain?   And now, believest thou that we deceive this people, that causes such joy in their 
hearts? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="36"></a>30:36</b>   And Korihor answered him, Yea. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="39"></a>30:39</b>   Now Alma said unto him: Will ye deny again that there

come. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="40"></a>30:40</b>   And now what evidence have ye that there is no God, or that Christ cometh not?  I say unto you that 
ye have none, save it be your word only. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

true? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="43"></a>30:43</b>   And now <span class="g">Korihor said unto Alma: If thou wilt

truth of thy words.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/good1.gif" width="32" height="32"><i>"Show me a sign."</i><br>
Korihor tells Alma that if he can just show him a sign to convince him that God exists, he will believe.
</font>

  <tr><td><b><a name="44"></a>30:44</b>   <span class="a">But Alma said unto him: Thou hast had signs enough; will ye tempt your God?  Will ye say, Show 
 unto me a sign, when ye have the testimony of all these thy brethren, and also all the holy prophets?  The 
 scriptures are laid before thee, yea, and all things denote there is a God; yea, even the earth, and all 
 things that are upon the face of it, yea, and its motion, yea, and also all the planets which move in their

<font size="-1">
 <img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<i>"Thou hast had signs enough."</i><br>
Alma refuses, saying that Korihor has signs enough. Others believe in God, so he should too. 
There is the bible, and the earth and its motions, and the planets. (Of course none of this is evidence for the existence of a 
God.)</font>
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="45"></a>30:45</b>   And yet do ye go about, leading away the hearts of this people, testifying unto them there is

 me a sign. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="46"></a>30:46</b>   <span class="a">And now it came to pass</span> that Alma said unto him: Behold,

Since Alma can't refute Korihor's arguments, he says he'll have God smite him so that he can no longer 
speak. It's better, he says, that Korihor's soul be lost than that he convince others that there is no God.</font>

 <tr><td><b><a name="48"></a>30:48</b>   Now Korihor said unto him: I do not deny the existence of a God, but I do not believe that

 not believe. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

 unto me: Go and reclaim this people, for they have all gone astray after an unknown God.  And he said unto me: 
 There is no God; yea, and he taught me that which I should say.  And I have taught his words; and I taught them 
 because they were pleasing unto the carnal mind; and I taught them, even until I had much success, insomuch that 
 I verily believed that they were true; and for this cause I withstood the truth, even until I have brought this 
 great curse upon me. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="54"></a>30:54</b>   Now when he had said this, he besought that Alma should pray unto God, that the curse might be

 <tr><td><b><a name="55"></a>30:55</b>   But Alma said unto him: If this curse should be taken from thee thou wouldst again lead away the

 <tr><td><b><a name="56"></a>30:56</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that <span class="i">the curse was
