<p><li>"Her house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall."<br>
    Since Rahab's house was built on the wall, how did she and her family survive when the wall fell down? 
    (See <a href="6.html#20">Joshua 6:20</a>) <a href="2.html#15">2:15</a>
    
<p><li>The priests were able to cross the Jordan without getting their feet wet. Glory!
<a href="3.html#16">3:8-17</a>

<p><li>At God's command, Joshua makes some knives and circumcises "again the children of Israel the second time"
(ouch!) at the "hill of the foreskins." <a href="5.html#2">5:2-3</a>

<p><li>It took the Israelites 40 years to travel from Egypt to Canaan, yet such a journey, even at that time, 
would have taken no more than a few weeks. <a href="5.html#6">5:6</a>

<p><li>Joshua meets a man with a sword in his hand who claims to be the captain of God's army. Joshua 
seemed to think the strange man was God himself, as he bowed down to worship him. Apparently God's 
captain agreed, telling Joshua to take off his shoe, since he was standing on holy ground (as Moses was 
told to do in Exodus 3:5). But whoever was, he disappeared, never to return again. <a href="5.html#13">5:13-15</a>
    
<p><li>"And Joshua fell on his face." <a href="5.html#14">5:14</a>

<p><li>God's plan for the destruction of Jericho: Have seven priests go before the ark with seven trumpets of ram's horns.
Then on the seventh day, they go around the city seven times. Finally, the priests blow a long blast from the ram's horns, all
the people shout, and the walls will fall down. <a href="6.html#4">6:3-5</a>

<p><li>Keep yourselves from "the accursed thing". Whatever that is. But be sure to save all the silver and gold for God! 
 <a href="6.html#18">6:18-19</a>
 
<p><li>Joshua and all the elders tear their clothes, fall on their faces, and put dust on their heads. They perform this tantrum
because the Israelites lost a battle (God was punishing them because one man (Achan) "took of the accursed thing"). 
<a href="7.html#1">7:1-13</a>

<p><li>And Joshua ... fell to the earth upon his face." <a href="7.html#6">7:6</a>

<p><li>"And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way."<br>
God slaughters the Amorites and even chases them along the way.  <a href="10.html#10">10:10</a>

<p><li>"The LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them ... and they died."<br>
As the Amorites try to escape, God sends down huge hailstones and kills even more of them. <a href="10.html#11">10:11</a>

<p><li>In a divine type of daylight savings time, God makes the sun stand still so that Joshua can get all his killing done
before dark. <a href="10.html#12">10:12-13</a>

<p><li>"The Lord fought for Israel." <a href="10.html#14">10:14, 42</a>

<p><li>"And the coast of Og king of Bashan, which as of the remnant of the giants...." 
<a href="12.html#4">12:4</a>, <a href="18.html#16">18:16</a>

<p><li> God's plan for accidental killings: Establish some cities of refuge that accidental killers can 
flee to so they won't be killed by "the avenger of blood." <a href="20.html#1">20:1-9</a>

<p><li>One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he it is that fighteth for you." <a href="23.html#10">23:10</a>

<p><li>God sent hornets to fight for the Israelites. <a href="24.html#12">24:12</a>
