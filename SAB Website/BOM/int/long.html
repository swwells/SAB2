<OL>
<h4>1 Nephi</h4>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../1ne/int.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p><li>"The Jews did mock him because ... he truly testified of their wickedness and their abominations ... they were angy with 
him ... as with the prophets of old, whom they had cast out and stoned."<br>
After Lehi saw the pillar of fire, God, Jesus, the apostles, and angels, and read from the book that God gave him, 
he went into town to tell the people about it. They all thought he was crazy, since they were a bunch of wicked, abominable Jews. 
<a href="../1ne/1.html#19">1:19-20</a>

<p><li>"Laman and Lemuel ... were like unto the Jews."<br>
Nephi's older brothers, Laman and Lemuel, were so evil that they were "like unto the Jews." (Being like a Jew is about as bad as it gets 
in the Book of Mormon.) <a href="../1ne/2.html#11">2:11-13</a>

<p><li>God goes on (and on) about what a great guy Nephi is and all the cool things he's going to do for him. But God hates Nephi's brothers, 
which he'll soon be cursing "even with a sore curse."  <a href="../1ne/2.html#21">2:21-23</a>

<p><li>Nephi saw an exceedingly white virgin. (Being white is exceedingly good in the Book of Mormon.) <a href="../1ne/11.html#13">11:13</a>

<p><li>The Native Americans are the descendants of those "who dwindled in 
unbelief." As a punishment for their disbelief, their skin was darkened and they 
became "a filthy people, full of idleness and all manner of abominations."
 <a href="../1ne/12.html#22">12:22-23</a>
 
<p><li>Nephi sees the "great and abominable church" and its founder, the devil.
 <a href="../1ne/13.html#6">13:6</a> 
 
 <p><li>The wrath of God is on the Native Americans (Nephi's brethren). <a href="../1ne/13.html#11">13:11</a>
 
 <p><li>God's wrath is on the Native Americans who were slaughtered by the Europeans. <a href="../1ne/13.html#14">13:14</a>

<p><li>God inspired the Europeans (who "were white, and exceedingly fair and beautiful" just like Nephi's descendants before the evil, 
dark-skinned  Laminites killed them all ) to slaughter the Native Americans. <a href="../1ne/13.html#15">13:15</a>

<p><li>"The Gentiles ... did humble themselves before the Lord; and the power of the Lord was with them." <a href="../1ne/13.html#16">13:16</a>

<p><li>The angel tells Nephi that the "great and 
abominable church" (the Catholics) ruined the Bibe by deleting the "plan and most precious parts."
 <a href="../1ne/13.html#26">13:26-32</a>
 
<p><li>Good news for "gentiles" in "the promised land." ("Gentiles" are non-Mormons and "the promised land" is 
the United States in Mormon-speak). All you have to do is become a Mormon and then you will be blessed by God 
(otherwise you're going to hell). <a href="../1ne/14.html#1">14:1-2</a>
 
<p><li>The Catholic church was founded by the devil to lead souls to hell. <a href="../1ne/14.html#3">14:3</a>

<p><li>f you're a gentile, you've only got two choices: become a Mormon or fall into the Catholic pit that leads to hell. 
<a href="../1ne/14.html#5">14:5-6</a>

<p><li>The angel tells Nephi that the lamb of God (Jesus) says that the time will come (2423 years later) when a 17 year old treasure 
digger from New York (Joseph Smith) will find some golden plates and translate them by staring into his hat at some magic rocks and 
thereby produce the "great and marvelous work" that we now know as the Book of Mormon. This book is, according to the angel, the best 
and most important book by far that you, me, or anyone else will ever read. And we'll be tortured forever after we die unless 
we believe it. <a href="../1ne/14.html#7">14:7</a>
 
<p><li>The "great and abominable church, ... the mother of abominations, 
whose founder is the devil." <a href="../1ne/14.html#9">14:9</a>

<p><li>There are only two churches: the church of the Lamb of God, and the church of the 
devil.You either belong to the good chuch or the bad church (the mother of abominations, 
the whore of all the earth). <a href="../1ne/14.html#10">14:10</a>

<p><li>"The whore of all the earth sat upon many waters." <a href="../1ne/14.html#11">14:11</a>

<p><li>The angel showed Nephi the Mormon church (the church of the Lamb of God). There weren't many Mormons, though, because of that 
fucking whore that sat on many waters (the Catholic Church). <a href="../1ne/14.html#12">14:12</a>

<p><li>The "great mother of abominations" recruits people from all over the earth 
to fight against the Lamb of God. <a href="../1ne/14.html#13">14:13</a>

<p><li>God hated pretty much everyone on earth (they were all just a bunch of Catholics to him) until the Mormons showed up. 
<a href="../1ne/14.html#15">14:15-17</a>

<p><li>The angel told Nephi to look over there. You see that guy in the white robe? That's the apostle John who will write the 
Book of Revelation about 700 years from now. (Which doesn't make a lot of sense since the apostle John didn't write Revelation, 
but oh well.) <a href="../1ne/14.html#18">14:18-22, 27</a>
 
<p><li>There's an "awful gulf" that separates the wicked from the saints.
 <a href="../1ne/15.html#28">15:28</a>
 
<p><li>There's an "awful hell" prepared for the wicked. <a href="../1ne/15.html#29">15:29</a>

<p><li>There's an "awful hell" prepared by the devil. <a href="../1ne/15.html#35">15:35</a>

<p><li>Among many other things, Nephi told his brothers that God 
straitens murmurers by sending fiery flying serpents to bite and kill them. (See <a href="../../num/21.html#6">Numbers 21:6</a>) 
<a href="../1ne/17.html#41">17:41</a>

<p><li>Then Zenos explains how all kinds of bad stuff would happen to the 
Jews because they "crucify the God of Israel." They'd be hated by all nations, wander in the flesh, etc. <a href="../1ne/19.html#13">19:13-14</a>
 
<p><li>The members of "the great and abominable church" (the whore of all the earth) will kill each other and 
get drunk on their own blood. <a href="../1ne/22.html#13">22:13</a>

<p><li>All those that fight again Zion (Mormonism), like "that great whore, that great and abominable church" 
will be destroyed. <a href="../1ne/22.html#14">22:14</a>

<p><li>They who fight again Zion (Mormonism) will be cut off. <a href="../1ne/22.html#19">22:19</a>

<p><li>You must do whatever the prophet (Jesus or Joseph Smith) says. Those who don't will be cut off.
 <a href="../1ne/22.html#20">22:20</a>
 
<p><li>Soon all the churches of the devil (non-Mormon churches) will be destroyed. <a href="../1ne/22.html#23">22:23</a>

<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../2ne/int.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p><li>God cursed the Lamanites (the ancestors of the Native Americans) causing their skin to turn dark and making them 
"loathsome" to His people. <a href="../2ne/5.html#21">5:21-22</a>

<p><li>God forbids intermarriage between the Nephites and Lamanites. Those who do will be cursed by 
God with "the same cursing".  <a href="../2ne/5.html#23">5:23</a>

<p><li>God's curse on the Lamanites (Native Americans) also caused them to "become an idle people, full 
of mischief." <a href="../2ne/5.html#24">5:24</a>

<p><li>Those who don't fight against Zion (the Mormon Church) and who don't join "the great and abominable 
church (the Catholic Church) will be saved. <a href="../2ne/6.html#12">6:12</a>

<p><li>Those who do not believe in the Messiah (Jesus) will be destroyed by fires, storms, 
earthquakes, war, disease, and starvation. <a href="../2ne/6.html#15">6:15</a>

<p><li>God will force people to eat their own flesh and drink their own blood. <a href="../2ne/6.html#18">6:18</a>

<p><li>"Many of our children shall perish in the flesh because of unbelief." <a href="../2ne/10.html#2">10:2</a>

<p><li>Jews are wicked. Only the Jews would crucify their God. <a href="../2ne/10.html#3">10:3</a>

<p><li>God gave the entire Western Hemisphere to the Mormon Church, but he blesses non-Mormon, non-Catholic, white Christians ("Gentiles" in Mormon-speak) too. <a href="../2ne/10.html#10">10:10</a>

<p><li>God will protect and strengthen America (since it's his favorite country). <a href="../2ne/10.html#12">10:12</a>

<p><li>Those who fight against Zion (Mormonism) will die, for they are the whore of all the earth. Those who are not 
for God are against God. <a href="../2ne/10.html#16">10:16</a> 

<p><li>America was consecrated by God to the seed of Nephi (Mormons). God likes America better than any other 
country. All Americans will someday worship God. (And become Mormons?) <a href="../2ne/10.html#19">10:19</a>

<p><li>The Jews created abominations and works of darkness. <a href="../2ne/25.html#2">25:2</a>

<p><li>Wo unto them that fight against God and the people of his church (the Mormons). <a href="../2ne/25.html#14">25:14</a>

<p><li>God will destroy (in varous ways) those who "dwindle in unbelief." <a href="../2ne/26.html#15">26:15</a>
<p><li>God won't give good stuff to those who "dwindle in unbelief." <a href="../2ne/26.html#17">26:17</a>
<p><li>God will get the Gentiles to kill all those who "dwindle in unbelief." <a href="../2ne/26.html#19">26:19</a>
<p><li>There are many bad churches out there. (The non-LDS ones.) <a href="../2ne/26.html#21">26:21</a>
<p><li>The devil is the founder of all those "secret combinations." <a href="../2ne/26.html#22">26:22</a>
<p><li>"Wo be unto him that rejecteth the word of God!<br>(By "word of God" Joseph Smith means the 
Book of Mormon.) <a href="../2ne/27.html#14">27:14</a>
<p><li>More ranting about "that great and abominable church, the whore of all the earth." <a href="../2ne/28.html#18">28:18</a>
<p><li>Death, hell, the devil, and the "endless torment" of "the lake of fire and brimstone."
 <a href="../2ne/28.html#23">28:23</a>
<p><li>Before many generations pass, Native Americans will convert to Mormonism, their skins will turn white, and they 
will become a "delightsome" people. <a href="../2ne/30.html#6">30:6</a>
<p><li>The Jews will also be converted and become a "delightsome" people. <a href="../2ne/30.html#7">30:7</a>
<p><li>Those who reject the Book of Mormon are of the devil. <a href="../2ne/33.html#5">33:5</a>
<p><li>Those who believe in Christ will also believe in the Book of Mormon. <a href="../2ne/33.html#10">33:10</a>

<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../jacob/int.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p><li>God curses "the land" to punish humans, and he has cursed the Lamanites (Native Americans) "with a sore 
cursing." <a href="../jacob/3.html#3">3:3</a>

<p><li>The Lamanites (Native Americans) are filthy and have dark skins because they were cursed by God. (But 
at least they weren't polygamists, as were the Nephites.) <a href="../jacob/3.html#5">3:5</a>

<p><li>If you don't repent, God will make your skin even darker than that of the Lamanites (Native Americans).
 <a href="../jacob/3.html#8">3:8</a>
 
<p><li>God made the Lamanites (Native Americans) filthy and dark skinned "because of their fathers."
 <a href="../jacob/3.html#9">3_9</a>
 
<p><li>"Jews were a stiffnecked people" who "despised the words of plainness," killed the prophets, and sought 
understanding. For this, God has blinded them and "taken away his plainness from them" so "that they may stumble."
 <a href="../jacob/4.html#14">4:14</a>
 
<p><li>God will curse some people and burn the world with fire. <a href="../jacob/6.html#3">6:3</a>

<p><li>Those who "bring forth evil fruit" will be "cast into the fire." <a href="../jacob/6.html#7">6:7</a>

<p><li>God will cast some people into a lake of fire and brimstone where he will torment them forever.
 <a href="../jacob/6.html#10">6:10</a>
 
 <p><li>Sherem, the first freethought martyr in the Book of Mormon [see the story of Korihor for another 
(<a href="../alma/30.html#12">Alma 30</a>)], tells Jacob he is misleading the people in by telling them 
(ca. 500 BCE) that Christ will be coming "many hundred years hence." <a href="../jacob/7.html#1">7:1-7</a>
 
<p><li>Jacob asks Sherem if he denies that Christ will come. Sherem answers that although he doesn't believe it now, 
he could be convinced if Jacob could show him a sign. Jacob responds by saying, "Thou art the devil ... but if 
God shall smite thee, let that be a sign unto thee."  <a href="../jacob/7.html#9">7:9-14</a>

<p><li>"He gave up the ghost."<br>
God gives Sherem a little sign: he kills him. <a href="../jacob/7.html#15">7:15-20</a>

<p><li>"This thing was pleasing to me."<br>
Jacob is pleased that God killed Sherem. <a href="../jacob/7.html#22">7:22</a>

<p><li>After God killed Sherem, things got back to normal. The Nephites were righteous and the Lamanites were wicked. So the Nephites built up their military to fight the Lamanites. <a href="../jacob/7.html#23">7:23-24</a>

<p><li>"Priestcraft"<br>
The term "priestcraft" is an obvious attempt to denigrate the Catholic Church. <a href="../alma/1.html#12">1:12</a>

<p><li>Those who didn't belong to the right church were lazy, wicked, babbling, idolatrous, proud people who 
were all a bunch of thieves and murderers. <a href="../alma/1.html#32">1:32</a>

<p><li>The Lamanites were naked, and their skins were dark because of a curse from God.

<p><li>The Lamanites were a wild, ferocious, and lazy people who delighted in murdereing, robbing, and 
plundering. God cursed them because of what their fathers did. <a href="../alma/17.html#14">17:14-15</a>

<p><li>"The dark veil of unbelief" <a href="../alma/19.html#6">19:6</a>

<p><li>God's curse of the Lamanites was lifted from the "Anti-Nephi-Lehies." So did their skin became

<p><li>Korihor is arrested for expressing his disbelief. <a href="../alma/30.html#29">30:29</a>

<p><li>Since Alma can't refute Korihor's arguments, he says he'll have God smite him so that he can no longer

<p><li>"The curse was not taken off of Korihor; but he was  cast out, and went about from house to house 
begging for his food." <a href="../alma/30.html#56">30:56</a>

<p><li>The chief judge warned everyone not to believe Korihor or they will also be struck dumb and be forced to 
beg for their food. <a href="../alma/30.html#57">30:57</a>

<p><li>Korihor was trampled upon by the Nephites until he was dead.

<p><li>Denying the Holy Ghost (refusing to become Mormon or escaping from Mormonism?) is the greatest 
abomination and is unpardonable. <a href="../alma/39.html#5">39:5-6</a>

<p><li>Evil people are those who "have no part or portion of the Spirit of the Lord." They will be 
"cast out into outer darkness; there shall be weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth."
 <a href="../alma/40.html#13">40:13</a>
 
<p><li>The Amalekites were even "more wicked and murderous" than the Lamanites.

<p><li>God is with Moroni and the Nephites. The Lord has delivered the Lamanites into their hands "because of [their]

<p><li>Alma prophesies that the Nephites will "dwindle in unbelief" 400 years after Jesus is born. (Dwindling in unbelief 
is <i>really</i> bad.) <a href="../alma/45.html#10">45:10</a>

<p><li>If the Nephites forsake God, then God will tear them to pieces. <a href="../alma/46.html#21">46:21</a>

giving way to indolence and all manner of lasciviousness." <a href="../alma/47.html#36">47:36</a>

<p><li>Those who were faithful "were delivered at all times," while "thousands of their wicked brethren" were 
enslaved, killed, forced to dwindled in unbelief, or to "mingle with the Lamanites [Native Americans]."
 <a href="../alma/50.html#22">50:22</a>
 
  <p><li>Moroni writes a petition empowering him "to compel those dissenters to defend their country or 
to put them to death." <a href="../alma/51.html#15">51:15</a>

<p><li>Four thousand dissenters were "hewn down by the sword." <a href="../alma/51.html#19">51:19</a>

<p><li> The rest of the dissenters were forced to live in freedom (just like the Iraqis!).
