<p><li>Virgins await those who enter paradise. <a href="index.htm#25">2:25</a>

<p><li>It's OK to have sex with your wives during Ramadan (at least after sunset). In fact you must "hold intercourse with them." 
All of them. It is your sacred Muslim duty. <a href="index.htm#187">2:187</a>

<p><li> Menstruation is a filthy disease. All good Muslim men should stay the hell away from menstruating women And for God sakes, 
don't have sex with them while they're menstruating. It creeps Allah out just to think of it. <a href="index.htm#222">2:222a</a>

<p><li> But don't worry guys. After they clean up you can have sex with them whenever you want. Allah loves clean men as much 
as he hates menstruating women. <a href="index.htm#222">2:222b</a>
 
<p><li>In the mind of Allah, women are like a dirty field for men to plow with their penises. Plow them whenever you like 
 (as long as they're not menstruating, of course.) <a href="index.htm#223">2:223</a>
 
 <p><li>Still, if a man doesn't want to have sex with his wives, Allah is OK with that, too. Wait four months, then if they 
 change their minds, go ahead and have sex with them. <a href="index.htm#226">2:226</a>

<p><li>When a man dies, his wives can't have sex for four months and ten days. After that, if they're not pregnant, it's no sin for 
the dead man if his wives have sex again. <a href="index.htm#234">2:234</a>
