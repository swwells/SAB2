       This is just another variation on the same old story. If you've been following along, you know what's going to happen.
       (See <a href="2.html#14">Judges 2:14</a>, <a href="3.html#8">3:8</a>, 
       <a href="6.html#1">6:1</a>, and <a href="10.html#7">10:7</a> for other versions of the same silly story.) <br>

       <p>1. The Israelites do evil in the sight of the Lord.
       
       <p>(4:1) <i>"The children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD."</i>
       
       <p>2. God sells them into slavery.
       
       <p>(4:2) <i><b>"The Lord sold them</b> into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan."</i>
       
       <p>3. The Israelites cry out to the Lord.
       
       <p>(4:3) <i>"The children of Israel cried unto the LORD."</i>
       
       <p>4. Gold slaughters the people he sold the Israelites to. 
       
       <p>(4:15-16) <i>The LORD discomfited Sisera</i> [the captain of King Jabin’s army], <i>and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword … 
       and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left."</i>       
      
     
 <p>This story is more interesting than most, though, because one of the characters is named Barak. (Although Barack Obama's 
       first name is not derived from this biblical character, believers sometimes like to pretend otherwise.)
       
       <p>Here are the details.
       
       <p>After Ehud dies, a woman became the leader of the Israelites. Her name is Deborah and she is called a prophetess and judge. 
       She sat under a palm tree and everyone "came up to her for judgment." 
       
<p>(4:4-5) <i>"Deborah, a prophetess, ... dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah ... and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment."</i>  

<p>One day, she summoned Barak and told him to take 10,000 soldiers to fight Sisera.

<p>(4:6-7) <i>"She sent and called Barak ... and said ... the LORD God of Israel commanded, 
saying ... take with thee ten thousand men ... to ... Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army ... and I will deliver him into thine hand."</i>   

<p>Barak, who was a bit of a chicken shit, said: 

<p>(4:8) <i>"If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go."</i>

<p>Deborah said that she would go with him and that God would deliver Sisera into the hands of a woman.

<p>(4:9)  <i>"I will surely go with thee ... for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak."</i>

<p><IMG src="../images/contra1.gif" > (4:11) <i>"Hobab the father in law of Moses"</i><br>
    <a href="../contra/mosesfil.html">Who was Moses' father-in-law?</a>
    
    <p><img src="../images/contra1.gif">(4:13) <i>"Nine hundred chariots  of iron"</i><br>
    <a href="../contra/iron.html">Can God stop iron chariots?</a>
    
    <p>So Deborah and Barak go off to fight in God's holy war. Guess what happens.
    
    <p>(4:15) <i>"The LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet."</i>
    
    <p>(4:16) <i>"But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host... and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left."</i>
    
    <p>That's right. God confused ("discomfited") Sisera's army, forcing them to either kill each other or kill 
	themselves. No one survived -- except Sisera, and God will take care of him
    in his next killing.

       Jael (our heroine) offers food and shelter to a traveler (Sisera, Jabin's captain), saying "turn in my Lord ... fear not." 
Then after giving him a glass of milk and tucking him in, she drives a tent stake through his head. "So God subdued on that day Jabin." <br>
