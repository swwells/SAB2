<img src="../images/contra1.gif" >  (8:5-6) <i>"There came unto him a centurion, beseeching
    him, And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick."</i><br>    
    Jesus is approached by a centurion who asks him to heal his servant (slave). But when 
    the same story is told in Luke (<A href="../lk/7.html#2">7:1-7</A>), the centurion doesn't come himself but sends 
    some &quot;elders of the Jews."<br>

    <img src="../images/interp.gif" > (8:6-7) <i>"My servant lieth at home sick ... And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him."</i>
     Here was the perfect opportunity for Jesus to condemn slavery. All he'd have to do is say, "OK, 
    I'll heal him. But then you must set your slave free, because slavery is an abomination to God."<br>
        <a href="../contra/slavery.html">Does God approve of slavery?</a>
        
        <p><img src="../images/interp.gif" > (8:5-13) What was the relationship between the centurion and his slave? 
        Were they a gay couple? If so, Jesus didn't seem to mind.

<img src="../images/interp.gif"> (8:14-15) Peter's mother-in-law was sick with a fever. Jesus healed her by touching her hand, so she 
could get back to serving them. (Peter's mother-in-law? The first pope was married?)

<p>(8:14) <i>"When Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever."</i>

<p>(8:15) <i>"And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them."</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (8:16) <i>"They brought unto him many that were possessed

<p>(8:21) <i>"Another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father."</i>

<p>(8:22) <i>"But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead."</i>

<p><img src="../images/sci1.gif">
<img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (8:24-26) Jesus and his disciples were crossing a lake in a boat when a storm came. Jesus was asleep, so his 
chicken-shit disciples woke him up. Jesus rebuked them for having little faith and then calmed the winds and the waves. All of which was to show, 
what? That weather is sent by God and can be controlled by faith?

<p>(8:24) <i>"There arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep."</i> 

<p>(8:25) <i>"And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish."</i> 

<p>(8:26) <i>"And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; 
and there was a great calm."</i> 

<p><img src="../images/contra1.gif" > (8:28) <i>"There met him two possessed with devils."</i><br>
<A href="../contra/possessed.html">How many men were possessed with devils?</a>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif" > (8:29) <i>"They cried out ... Jesus, thou Son of God."</i><br>  
The devils confess that Jesus is the Son of
God. So according to <A href="../1jn/4.html#15">1 John 4:15</A>, God dwells in the devils and the devils in God.

<p><img src="../images/inj1.gif" > 
<img src="../images/cr1.gif" > (8:32) <i>"The whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea,
 and perished in the waters."</i><br>
The devils ask Jesus to cast them into a herd of pigs. He does, and the poor
pigs run off into the sea and drown. 

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif" >  (8:34) <i>"The whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts."</i><br>
