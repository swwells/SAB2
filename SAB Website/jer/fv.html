<p><li> God tries to "correct"&nbsp; people by killing their children.  <a href="2.html#30">2:30</a>

<p><li> A divorced woman is &quot;polluted&quot; when she remarries. The man, of course, remains perfectly 
clean through it all, even though he was the one who &quot;put her away&quot; in the first place. 
<a href="3.html#1">3:1</a>

<p><li>"As a wife treacherously departeth from her husband...."<br>
If a woman leaves her husband, she is "treacherous," but a man is blameless when he "puts her away" for no 
reason. <a href="3.html#20">3:20</a>

<p><li>God just can't hold in his fury any longer. He will kill everyone: husbands and wives, children and old people.
<a href="6.html#11">6:11</a>

<p><li>"How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have ... committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses."

<p><li>To punish the men, God will "give their wives to others." <a href="8.html#10">8:10</a>

death. <a href="11.html#22">11:22</a>

<p><li> God plans to make everyone in the kingdom drunk and then "dash the fathers and the sons 
together." The merciful God of peace vows to "not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy them."  <a href="13.html#12">13:12-14</a>

<p><li> God will kill children and make widows as numerous as grains of sand. <a href="15.html#7">15:7-8</a>

<p><li> God tells Jeremiah not to get married or have children, because he's 
going to kill everyone (mothers and daughters, fathers and sons). They all &quot;shall die of grievous 
deaths,&quot; and that shall neither &quot;be lamented&quot; nor buried, but &quot;shall 
be as dung upon the face of the earth.&quot;  For he has removed peace, "lovingkindness," and mercy 
from the people.  <a href="16.html#1">16:1-7</a>
