<p><li>"God, that cannot lie" God, like George Washington (but unlike the author of Titus who falsely claims to be Paul), cannot tell a lie. <a href="1.html#2">1:2</a>

<p><li>The people of Crete are "always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies."  <a href="1.html#12">1:12</a>

<p><li>Disregard &quot;Jewish fables and commandments.quot; Like most of the Bible, maybe? <a href="1.html#14">1:14</a>

<p><li>"The grace of God ... hath appeared to all men." At the time this statement was written, only 
a very small minority had seen or heard about Jesus. And still today there are those who have never heard his name. 
 <a href="2.html#11">2:11</a>
 
 <p><li>"Not by works ... but ... by the washing ... of the Holy Ghost."<br>
People aren't saved by doing good things, but by the arbitrary decision of God. He decides who gets washed by the Holy 
Ghost and who doesn't. Hasa diga eebowai. <a href="3.html#5">3:5</a>
 
<p><li>"Avoid ... genealogies." Like <a href="../gen/10.html#1">Gen 10</A>, 
<a href="../1chr/1.html#1">1 Chr 1-9</a>, <a href="../mt/1.html">Mt 1</a> and <a href="../lk/3.html">Lk 3</a>? 
<a href="3.html#9">3:9</a>
