"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",

"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",

"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",

"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>35:2</b>   Yea, and the rest of the brethren, after they had preached the word unto the Zoramites, also came 
over into the land of Jershon. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>35:3</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that after the more popular part of the Zoramites 
had consulted together concerning the words which had been preached unto them, they were angry because of the 
word, for it did destroy their craft; therefore they would not hearken unto the words. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>35:4</b>   And they sent and gathered together throughout all the land all the people, and consulted with 
them concerning the words which had been spoken. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>35:5</b>   Now their rulers and their priests and their teachers did not let the people know concerning 
their desires; therefore they found out privily the minds of all the people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>35:6</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that after they had found out the minds of all the 
people, those who were in favor of the words which had been spoken by Alma and his brethren were cast out of 
the land; and they were many; and they came over also into the land of Jershon. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>35:7</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Alma and his brethren did minister unto them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>35:8</b>   Now the people of the Zoramites were angry with the people of Ammon who were in Jershon, and 
the chief ruler of the Zoramites, being a very wicked man, sent over unto the people of Ammon desiring them 
that they should cast out of their land all those who came over from them into their land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>35:9</b>   And he breathed out many threatenings against them.  And now the people of Ammon did not 
fear their words; therefore they did not cast them out, but they did receive all the poor of the Zoramites 
that came over unto them; and they did nourish them, and did clothe them, and did give unto them lands for 
their inheritance; and they did administer unto them according to their wants. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>35:10</b>   Now this did stir up the Zoramites to anger against the people of Ammon, and they began to 
mix with the Lamanites and to stir them up also to anger against them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>35:11</b>   And thus the Zoramites and the Lamanites began to make preparations for war against 
the people of Ammon, and also against the Nephites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>35:12</b>   And thus ended the seventeenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>35:13</b>   And the people of Ammon departed out of the land of Jershon, and came over into the land of 
Melek, and gave place in the land of Jershon for the armies of the Nephites, that they might contend with 
the armies of the Lamanites and the armies of the Zoramites; and thus commenced a war betwixt the Lamanites 
and the Nephites, in the eighteenth year of the reign of the judges; and an account shall be given of their 
wars hereafter. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>35:14</b>   And Alma, and Ammon, and their brethren, and also the two sons of Alma returned to the 
land of Zarahemla, after having been instruments in the hands of God of bringing many of the Zoramites to 
repentance; and as many as were brought to repentance were driven out of their land; but they have lands 
for their inheritance in the land of Jershon, and they have taken up arms to defend themselves, and their 
wives, and children, and their lands. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>35:15</b>   Now Alma, being grieved for the iniquity of his people, yea for the wars, and the 
bloodsheds, and the contentions which were among them; and having been to declare the word, or sent to 
declare the word, among all the people in every city; and seeing that the hearts of the people began to 
wax hard, and that they began to be offended because of the strictness of the word, his heart 
was <span class="a">exceedingly</span> sorrowful. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>35:16</b>   Therefore, he caused that his sons should be gathered together, that he might give unto 
them every one his charge, separately, concerning the things pertaining unto righteousness.   And we have 
an account of his commandments, which he gave unto them according to his own record. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
