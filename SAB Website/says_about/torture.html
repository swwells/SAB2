<dl>

<dt>Sometimes you just need to beat people for their own good.
<p><dd>The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripes the inward parts of the belly. 
<a href="../pr/20.html#30">Proverbs 20:30</a>

<p><dt>Some people should be beaten as as a punishment for their crimes.
<p><dd>And it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie 
down, and to be beaten. <a href="../dt/25.html#2">Deuteronomy 25:2</a>

<!--
<p><dt>Those who tortured others should be tortured twice as much.

<p><dd>Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup 
which she hath filled fill to her double. How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so 
much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and 
shall see no sorrow. Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she 
shall be utterly burned with fire. <a href="../rev/18.html#6">Revelation 18:6-8</a>

-->

<p><dt>It's always a good idea to beat fools. Beat them whenever you find them.

<p><dd>A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes. 
<a href="../pr/18.html#6">Proverbs 18:6</a>

<p><dd>Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.
 <a href="../pr/19.html#29">Proverbs 19:29</a>

<p><dd>A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool's back.
 <a href="../pr/26.html#3">Proverbs 26:3</a>

<p><dt>And slaves may be beaten, as long they survive for at least a day or two after the beating.

<p><dd>If a man beats his male or female slave with a rod and the slave dies as a direct result, he 
must be punished, but he is not to be punished if the slave gets up after a day or two, since the 
slave is his property. <a href="../ex/21.html#20">Exodus 21:20-21</a>

<p><dt>Beating your children is a sure sign of parental love.

<p><dd>He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes. 
<a href="../pr/13.html#24">Proverbs 13:24</a>

<p><dt>And don't stop just because they cry. 

<p><dd>Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying. 
<a href="../pr/19.html#18">Proverbs 19:18</a>

<p><dt>Beating your children will make them less foolish.

<p><dd>Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction shall drive it far from 
him. <a href="../pr/22.html#15">Proverbs 22:15</a>

<p><dd>The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame. 
<a href="../pr/29.html#15">Proverbs 29:15</a>

<p><dt>So beat them hard and often. Don't worry about hurting them. 
You may break a few bones and cause some brain damage, but it isn't going to kill them. And even if 
it does, they'll be better off. They'll thank you in heaven for beating the hell out of them.

<p><dd>Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die.
Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell. 
<a href="../pr/23.html#13">Proverbs 23:13-14</a>

<!--
<p><dt>The Bible has many examples of a good and proper use of torture. 

<p>For example, David was 
"<a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2006/07/david-man-after-gods-own-heart-wwdd.html">a man 
after God's own heart</a>" (<a href="../1sam/13.html#14">1 Samuel 13:14</a>, 
<a href="../acts/13.html#22">Acts 13:22</a>) and "did what was right in the sight of the Lord ... save only 
in the matter of Uriah the Hittite" (<a href="../1kg/15.html#5">1 Kings 15:5</a>). Since he tortured the 
inhabitants of several cities, torture (at least in certain situations) must be okay with God.

<p><dd>And he brought forth
    the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of
    iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and
    thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. <a href="../2sam/12.html#31">2 Samuel 12:31</a>

<p><dd>And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even 
so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. <a href="../1chr/20.html#3">1 Chronicles 20:3</a>

<p><dt>Nehemiah, who is considered a good leader in the Bible, beat people and pulled out their 
hair.

<p><dd>And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, 
and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their 
daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves. <a href="../neh/13.html#25">Nehemiah 13:25</a>

-->

<p><dt>At times, Jesus seemed to look favorably on torture.


<p><dt>In his parables, for example, Jesus often spoke of torturing his enemies. 

<p><dd>And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors. <a href="../mt/18.html#34">Matthew 18:34</a>

<p><dd>And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was
    speechless. Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him
    into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <a href="../mt/22.html#12">Matthew 22:12-13</a>

<p><dd>The lord of that
    servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that
    he is not aware of, And shall cut him asunder, and appoint
    him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 
    <a href="../mt/24.html#50">Matthew 24:50-51</a>

<p><dd>The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour
    when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with
    the unbelievers. And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according
    to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. <a href="../lk/12.html#46">Luke 12:46-48</a>

<p><dt>The devils expected Jesus to torture them. (And Jesus didn't deny that he planned to do so.)

<p><dd>And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art 
thou come hither to torment us before the time? <a href="../mt/8.html#29">Matthew 8:29</a>

<p><dd>Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not. 
<a href="../mk/5.html#7">Mark 5:7</a>

<p><dd>What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not. 
<a href="../lk/8.html#28">Luke 8:28</a>
<p><dt>God uses a rod to beat those who disobey his commandments.

<p><dd>If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;  Then will I visit their transgression 
with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.<a href="../ps/89.html#31">Psalm 89:31-2</a>

<p><dt>At the end of the world, God will torture people until they want to die. But he will not let them 
die so that he can continue to torture them. 

<p><dd>And to them it was given
    that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five
    months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man. And in those days shall
    men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them. 
    <A href="../rev/9.html#5">Revelation 9:5-6</A>
    

<p><dt>But the ultimate use of torture, a torture a greater than which can not be conceived, is hell. 

<p><dd>The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things 
that offend, and them which do iniquity; And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be 
wailing and gnashing of teeth. <a href="../mt/13.html#41">Matthew 13:41-42</a>

<p><dd>If thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to 
enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire. 
<a href="../mt/18.html#8">Matthew 18:8-9</a>

<p><dd>Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, 
prepared for the devil and his angels. <a href="../mt/25.html#41">Matthew 25:41</a>

<p><dd>...hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is 
not quenched. <a href="../mk/9.html#43">Mark 9:43-48</a>

<p><dd>And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: 
the rich man also died, and was buried; And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth 
Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, 
and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am 
tormented in this flame. <a href="../lk/16.html#22">Luke 16:22-24</a>

<p><dd>The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into 
the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the 
holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever 
and ever. <a href="../rev/14.html#10">Revelation 14:10-11</a>
