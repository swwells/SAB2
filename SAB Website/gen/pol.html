<p><li>"Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over ... every living thing that moveth upon the earth."<br> 
This verse is used to justify Christian opposition to birth control, concern for the environment, and animal rights. The earth was made for humans, and they can do as they damn well please with it.
<a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ann_Coulter#On_the_environment">Ann Coulter says</a>, presumably using this verse as for justification, "God gave us the earth. 
We have dominion over the plants, the animals, the trees. God said, 'Earth is yours. Take it. Rape it. It's yours.'" <a href="1.html#28">1:28</a>

<p><li>"To dress and keep it"<br>
<a href="http://bibletools.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/Bible.show/sVerseID/46/eVerseID/46">Some believers</a> claim that this verse 
 requires them to be environmentalists. <a href="2.html#15">2:15</a>
 
<p><li>"Am I my brother's keeper?"<br>
Quoted by President Obama at the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/02/obama-speeech-at-national-breakfast_n_1249837.html">2012 National Prayer Breakfast</a>, implying that 
the answer is, "Yes, we are our brother's keeper," although Cain probably meant something more like, "I don't know, it's not my day to watch him." <a href="4.html#9">4:9</a>
 
<p><li>"While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease."<br> 
<a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/james-inhofe-says-bible-refutes-climate-change">Senator James Inhofe (R-OK) claims</a> that this verse proves that human influenced climate change is impossible.

<p><li>God gave Abraham and his descendants all 
of the land of Canaan "forever". This promise <a href="http://www.jhm.org/Home/About/WhySupportIsrael">is still used</a> to justify the  
unending battles over the land in the Middle East. <a href="13.html#14">13:14-15</a>, <a href="15.html#18">15:18</a>, <a href="17.html#8">17:8</a>, <a href="22.html#17">22:17-18</a>,
