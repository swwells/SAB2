<p><li>Jesus falsely prophesied that Nathaniel would see heaven open and angels descend upon Jesus. Nathaniel never saw it; 
neither has anyone else. <a href="1.html#51">1:51</a>

<p><li>Jesus says that "the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear 
the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live."  <a href="5.html#25">5:25, 28</a>

<p><li>Jesus claims that Moses wrote about him. Where? It's a shame he didn't give us chapter and verse. 
 <a href="5.html#46">5:46</a>
 
<p><li>Jesus says that those who believe in him will, as the scripture says, have living waters flowing out of their
bellies. Well that sounds like fun, but there is no such scripture in the Bible.  <a href="7.html#38">7:38</a>

<p><li>Jesus falsely prophesies that "there shall be one fold, and one shepherd." This will never happen as long as
Christian beliefs are based on the Bible.  <a href="10.html#16">10:16</a>

<p><li>This verse claims that Jesus fulfils the prophecy in <a href="../zech/9.html#9">Zechariah 9:9</a>. But this cannot be 
since the person referred to in Zechariah (see verses 10-13) was both a military leader and the king of an earthly kingdom.  
<a href="12.html#15">12:15</a>

<p><li>Verse 33 says that during Jesus' crucifixion, the soldiers didn't break his legs because he was already dead.
Verse 36 claims that this fulfilled a prophecy: "Not a bone of him shall be broken." But there is no such prophecy.
It is sometimes said that the prophecy appears in <a href="../ex/12.html#46">Ex 12:46</a>, 
<a href="../num/9.html#12">Num  9:12</a> and <a href="../ps/34.html#20">Ps 34:20</a>. This is not correct.
Exodus 12:46 and Num.9:12 are not prophecies, they are 
commandments. The Israelites are told not to break the bones of the Passover lamb, and this is all it is about. And 
Psalm 34:20 seems to refer to righteous people in general
(see verse 19, where a plural is used), not to make a prophecy about a specific person.  <a href="19.html#33">19:33, 36</a>

<p><li>Jesus implies that he will return to earth during the lifetime of John.  <a href="21.html#22">21:22</a>
