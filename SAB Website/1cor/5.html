<img src="../images/contra1.gif"> (5:1-5) Paul, judging from rumors alone, complains
that there are fornicators among his followers in Corinth; he is even worried
that some have had sex with their fathers' wives. He says that those who have
done these things should be "delivered to Satan for the destruction of the flesh" so that their 
soul can be saved.<br>
<a href="../contra/saved.html">What you must do to get saved</a>

<p>(5:1) <i>"It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much 
as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife."</i>

<p>(5:3) <i>"I ... have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed."</i><br>
<a href="../contra/judge.html">To judge or not to judge</a>

<p>(5:5) <b><i>"To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be
    saved in the day of the Lord Jesus."</i></b>
    
<p><img src="../images/interp.gif"> (5:9a)<i> "I wrote unto you in an epistle."</i><br>
Despite its title, First Corinthians wasn't the first epistle that Paul wrote the Corinthians. There was another 
(Zeroth Corinthians?) that was either lost or considered  not worthy of including in the Bible.

<p><img src="../images/int.gif" >
<img src="../images/interp.gif" > (5:9b-13) Stay away from fornicators, idolaters,  and drunkards. 
Do not associate, speak to, or eat dinner with such "wicked" people.

<p>Jehovah's Witnesses use these verses to justify disfellowshipping those who fail to follow 
    the teachings of the Governing Body. JWs are told to 
shun disfellowshipped family and friends. They are not to speak to them or share a 
meal with them. If a witness is caught doing so, they will be disfellowshipped as well.

<p>(5:9b-10) <i>"Not to company with fornicators ... or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters."</i> 

<p>(5:11) <i>"If any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, 
or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat."</i>

<p>(5:13) <i>"Put away from among yourselves that wicked person."</i>
