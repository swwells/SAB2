the last chapter (<A href="10.html#10">10:10-13</A>). All kinds of beasts,
creeping things, and fowls drop down from the sky in a big sheet, and a voice
(God's, Satan's?) tells him to "Arise, Peter; slay and eat."

<p>(11:5) <i>"In a trance I saw a vision ... a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners."</i>

    So he went with them to another guy’s house who had seen an angel who told him to believe whatever Peter said so that he and his family would be saved.
     When they arrived, Peter started talking, the Holy Ghost fell on everyone and they all lived happily ever after. (Or something like that.)
