Moses does it all for God. First he kills
an animal; wipes the blood on Aaron's ears, thumbs, and big toes. Then he
sprinkles blood round about and waves the guts before the Lord. Finally he burns
the whole mess for &quot;a sweet savour before the Lord.&quot;

about with his finger .. and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar."</i>
