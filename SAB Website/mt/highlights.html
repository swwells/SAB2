He had no objection to the cruelties of the Old Testament and 
said that its laws will be binding forever. 
    <A href="5.html#17">5:17</A>
    
  <p><li>To avoid sin, Jesus told his followers to cut off their hands and pluck
    out their eyes. This advice was given immediately after he said that anyone who
    looks with lust at a women commits adultery. <A href="5.html#29">5:29</A>, <A href="18.html#8" >18:8</A>
    
  <p><li>Jesus told his disciples not to pray in public. <A href="6.html#5">6:5-6</A>
  
  <p><li>He said that most people are going to hell. <A href="7.html#13">7:13-14</A>
  
  <p><li>He sent some devils into a herd of pigs, causing them to run off
    a cliff and drown in the waters below. <A href="8.html#32" >8:32</A>
    
  <p><li>Families will be torn apart because of Jesus (this is one of the few &quot;prophecies&quot; in the Bible that has 
  actually come true). &quot;Brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall 
  rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death." <A href="10.html#21" >10:21</A>
  
  <p><li>Jesus came to destroy families by making family  members hate each other. He 
came &quot;not 
  to send peace, but a sword.&quot; <A href="10.html#34" >10:34-37</A>
  
  <p><li>He condemned entire cities to dreadful deaths and to the eternal torment of hell because they didn't care for 
  his preaching. <A href="11.html#20" >11:20-24</A>
  
  <p><li>He spoke in parables so that no one would understand him, "lest ... they ... 
  should understand ... and should be converted, and I should heal them." <A href="13.html#10">13:10-15</A>
  
  <p><li>"For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him 
  shall be taken away even that he hath." Isn't this from the Republican Party platform? 
  <A href="13.html#12" >13:12</A>, <A href="25.html#29">25:29</A>
  
  <p><li>Jesus was rejected by those who knew him best -- the people of his home town of Nazareth. 
  <A href="13.html#55" >13:55-57</A>
  
  <p><li>Herod thought Jesus was a resurrected John the Baptist. Apparently, it was a common opinion at the time. <A href="14.html#2" >14:2</A>, <A href="16.html#13" >16:13-14</A>
  
  <p><li>Jesus told his followers that he would return and establish his kingdom within their lifetime. 
  <A href="16.html#28">16:28</A>, <A href="23.html#36" >23:36</A>, <A href="24.html#34" >24:34</A>
  
  <p><li>Abandon your wife and children for Jesus and he'll give your a big reward. <A href="19.html#29" >19:29</A>
  
  <p><li>Matthew's Jesus rode into Jerusalem sitting on <I>both</I> an ass
    and a colt (must have taken some practice!). <A href="21.html#2">21:2-7</A>
    
  <p><li>"His blood be on us, and on our children." This verse blames the Jews for the death of Jesus and has been used
    to justify their persecution for twenty centuries. <A href="27.html#25">27:25</A>
