<p><li><a href="../interp/prophet.html">Who is the prophesied prophet? Jesus or Muhammad?</a> 
<a href="3.html#22">3:22-24</a>

<p><li>If the name Jehovah [or YHWH] is so important, why isn't it found in the NT? And why does it say in 
<a href="../acts/4.html#12">Acts 4:12</a> that
there is only one name (Jesus Christ, v. 10) "whereby we must be saved"?  <a href="4.html#12">4:12</a>

<p><li>"Peter and John ... were unlearned and ignorant men."<br>
Then they didn't write the New Testament books that are attributed to them. The gospel of John and Peter and John's epistles 
are all forgeries. <a href="4.html#12">4:13</a>

<p><li>Imagine no possessions: The early Christians were communists. (See <a href="5.html#1">5:1-11</a> for the dark side of 
Christian communism.) <a href="4.html#32">4:32-35</a>

<p><li>Stephen, as he is dying, asks Jesus (not Jehovah) to receive his spirit. But how could Jesus receive his spirit if,
as the Governing Body teaches, Jesus is not God and if the soul dies along with the body.  
<a href="7.html#59">7:59</a>

<p><li>Although in verse 59, Stephen was clearly praying to Jesus, the NWT tries to give the (false) impression that he
was really praying to Jehovah by translating "Lord" (kyrios) as "Jehovah". [Then, bending his knees, he cried out with
a strong voice: "Jehovah, do not charge this sin against them." NWT]  <a href="7.html#60">7:60</a>

<p><li>Was the eunuch that Philip baptized gay? <a href="8.html#38">8:38</a>

<p><li>"The Holy Ghost said ... I have called them." Jehovah's Witnesses deny that the Holy Spirit is 
a person. Why then does he talk and refer to himself in the first person in this verse? 
<a href="13.html#2">13:2</a>

<p><li>Many Jehovah's Witnesses have needlessly died because the 
WatchTower Society teaches that abstaining from blood, as required by these verses, 
prohibits blood transfusions. <a href="15.html#20">15:20, 29</a>

<p><li>The jailer was so impressed with the holy jailbreak that he converted on the spot. He and his entire family were baptized that night. 
It didn't matter to Paul (or God) what the jailer's wife and kids thought about it. They were "his" so he 
could do whatever the hell he wanted with (or to) them. 
(This stupid story supports the idea of infant baptism, which has divided Christians for centuries.) <a href="16.html#33">16:33</a>
