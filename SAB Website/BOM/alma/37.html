"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",

"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",

"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",

"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",

"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",

me; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>37:2</b>   And I also command you that ye keep a record of this people, according as I have done, upon the
 plates of Nephi, and keep all these things sacred which I have kept, even as I have kept them; for it is for a 
 wise purpose that they are kept. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>37:3</b>   And these plates of brass, which contain these engravings, which have the records of the holy 
 scriptures upon them, which have the genealogy of our forefathers, even from the beginning --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>37:4</b>   Behold, it has been prophesied by our fathers, that they should be kept and handed down from one 
 generation to another, and be kept and preserved by the hand of the Lord until they should go forth <span class="plag">unto every 
 nation, kindred, tongue, and people</span>, that they shall know of the mysteries contained thereon. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

 <tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>37:5</b>   And now behold, if they are kept they must retain their brightness; yea, and they will retain their 
 brightness; yea, and also shall all the plates which do contain that which is holy writ. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>37:6</b>   Now ye may suppose that this is foolishness in me; but behold I say unto you, that by small 
 and simple things are great things brought to pass; and small means in many instances doth confound the wise. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>37:7</b>   And the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great and eternal purposes; and by very 
 small means the Lord doth confound the wise and bringeth about the salvation of many souls. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>37:8</b>   And now, it has hitherto been wisdom in God that these things should be preserved; for behold, 
 they have enlarged the memory of this people, yea, and convinced many of the error of their ways, and brought 
 them to the knowledge of their God unto the salvation of their souls. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>37:9</b>   Yea, I say unto you, were it not for these things that these records do contain, which are on 
 these plates, Ammon and his brethren could not have convinced so many thousands of the Lamanites of the 
 incorrect tradition of their fathers; yea, these records and their words brought them unto repentance; that 
 is, they brought them to the knowledge of the Lord their God, and to rejoice in Jesus Christ their Redeemer. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>37:10</b>   And who knoweth but what they will be the means of bringing many thousands of them, yea, and 
 also many thousands of our stiffnecked brethren, the Nephites, who are now hardening their hearts in sin and 
 iniquities, to the knowledge of their Redeemer? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>37:11</b>   Now these mysteries are not yet fully made known unto me; therefore I shall forbear. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>37:12</b>   And it may suffice if I only say they are preserved for a wise purpose, which purpose is 
 known unto God; for he doth counsel in wisdom over all his works, and his paths are straight, and his course 
 is one eternal round. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>37:13</b>   O remember, remember, my son Helaman, how strict are the commandments of God.  And he said: 
 If ye will keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land -- but if ye keep not his commandments ye shall 
 be cut off from his presence. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>37:14</b>   And now remember, my son, that God has entrusted you with these things, which are sacred, 
 which he has kept sacred, and also which he will keep and preserve for a wise purpose in him, that he may 
 show forth his power unto future generations. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>37:15</b>   And now behold, I tell you by the spirit of prophecy, that if ye transgress the commandments 
 of God, behold, these things which are sacred shall be taken away from you by the power of God, and ye shall 
 be <span class="plag">delivered up unto Satan, that he may sift you as chaff before the wind.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

</font>
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>37:16</b>   But if ye keep the commandments of God, and do with these things which are sacred according to 
 that which the Lord doth command you, (for you must appeal unto the Lord for all things whatsoever ye must do 
 with them) behold, no power of earth or hell can take them from you, for God is powerful to the fulfilling of 
 all his words. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>37:17</b>   For he will fulfil all his promises which he shall make unto you, for he has fulfilled his 
 promises which he has made unto our fathers. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>37:18</b>   For he promised unto them that he would  preserve these things for a wise purpose in him, that 
 he might show forth his power unto future generations. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>37:19</b>   And now behold, one purpose hath he fulfilled, even to the restoration of many thousands of 
 the Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth; and he hath shown forth his power in them, and he will also still 
 show forth his power in them unto future generations; therefore they shall be preserved. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>37:20</b>   Therefore I command you, my son Helaman, that ye be diligent in fulfilling all my words, and 
 that ye be diligent in keeping the commandments of God as they are written. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>37:21</b>   And now, I will speak unto you concerning those twenty-four plates, that ye keep them, that the 
 mysteries and the works of darkness, and their secret works, or the secret works of those people who have been 
 destroyed, may be made manifest unto this people; yea, all their murders, and robbings, and their plunderings, 
 and all their wickedness and abominations, may be made manifest unto this people; yea, and that ye preserve 
 these interpreters. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>37:22</b>   For behold, the Lord saw that his people began to work in darkness, yea, work secret murders 
 and abominations; therefore the Lord said, if they did not repent they should be destroyed from off the face 
 of the earth. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>37:23</b>   And the Lord said: I will prepare unto my servant Gazelem, a stone, which shall shine forth 
 in darkness unto light, that I may discover unto my people who serve me, that I may discover unto them the 
 works of their brethren, yea, their secret works, their works of darkness, and their wickedness and 
 abominations. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>37:24</b>   And now, my son, these interpreters were prepared that the word of God might be fulfilled, 
 which he spake, saying: <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>37:25</b>   I will bring forth out of darkness unto light all their secret works and their abominations; 
 and except they repent I will destroy them from off the face of the earth; and I will bring to light all their 
 secrets and abominations, unto every nation that shall hereafter possess the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>37:26</b>   And now, my son, we see that they did not repent; therefore they have been destroyed, and thus 
 far the word of God has been fulfilled; yea, their secret abominations have been brought out of darkness and 
 made known unto us. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>37:27</b>   And now, my son, I command you that ye retain all their oaths, and their covenants, and their 
 agreements in their secret abominations; yea, and all their signs and their wonders ye shall keep from this 
 people, that they know them not, lest peradventure they should fall into darkness also and be destroyed. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>37:28</b>   For behold, there is a curse upon all this land, that destruction shall come upon all those 
 workers of darkness, according to the power of God, when they are fully ripe; therefore I desire that this 
 people might not be destroyed. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>37:29</b>   Therefore ye shall keep these secret plans of their oaths and their covenants from this people, 
and only their wickedness and their murders and their abominations shall ye make known unto them; and ye shall 
teach them to abhor such wickedness and abominations and murders; and ye shall also teach them that these people 
were destroyed on account of their wickedness and abominations and their murders. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>37:30</b>   For behold, they murdered all the prophets of the Lord who came among them to declare unto them 
concerning their iniquities; and the blood of those whom they murdered did cry unto the Lord their God for 
vengeance upon those who were their murderers; and thus the judgments of God did come upon these workers of 
darkness and secret combinations. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>37:31</b>   Yea, and cursed be the land forever and ever unto those workers of darkness and secret 
combinations, even unto destruction, except they repent before they are fully ripe. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="32"></a>37:32</b>   And now, my son, remember the words which I have spoken unto you; trust not those secret plans 
unto this people, but teach them an everlasting hatred against sin and iniquity. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="33"></a>37:33</b>   Preach unto them repentance, and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ; teach them to humble themselves 
and to be meek and lowly in heart; teach them to withstand every temptation of the devil, with their faith on the 
Lord Jesus Christ. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="34"></a>37:34</b>   Teach them to never be weary of good works, but to be <span class="plag">meek and 
lowly in heart; for such shall find rest to their souls.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">

I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. -- <a href="../../mt/11.html#29">Matthew 11:29</a>
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="35"></a>37:35</b>   O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the 
commandments of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="36"></a>37:36</b>   Yea, and cry unto God for all thy support; yea, let all thy doings be unto the Lord, and 
whithersoever thou goest let it be in the Lord; yea, let all thy thoughts be directed unto the Lord; yea, 
let the affections of thy heart be placed upon the Lord forever. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="37"></a>37:37</b>   Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good; yea, when thou 
liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest 
in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at 
the last day. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="38"></a>37:38</b>   And now, my son, I have somewhat to say concerning <span class="a">the thing which our fathers call a ball, 
or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord 
prepared it.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" border="0" width="32" height="32"><font size="-1">
The magic ball, director, Liahona, or compass. This was the gadget that God gave Nephi for navigation. It worked "according to 
their faith in God."</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="39"></a>37:39</b>   <span class="a">And behold, there cannot any man work after the manner of so curious a workmanship.  And 
behold, it was prepared to show unto our fathers the course which they should travel in the wilderness.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="40"></a>37:40</b>   <span class="a">And it did work for them according to their faith in God</span>; therefore, if they had faith to 
believe that God could cause that those spindles should point the way they should go, behold, it was done; 
therefore they had this miracle, and also many other miracles wrought by the power of God, day by day. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="41"></a>37:41</b>   Nevertheless, because those miracles were worked by small means it did show unto them 
marvelous works.  They were slothful, and forgot to exercise their faith and diligence and then those 
marvelous works ceased, and they did not progress in their journey; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="42"></a>37:42</b>   Therefore, they tarried in the wilderness, or did not travel a direct course, and were 
afflicted with hunger and thirst, because of their transgressions. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="43"></a>37:43</b>   And now, my son, I would that ye should understand that these things are not without a 
shadow; for as our fathers were slothful to give heed to this compass (now these things were temporal) 
they did not prosper; even so it is with things which are spiritual. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="44"></a>37:44</b>   For behold, it is as easy to give heed to the word of Christ, which will point to you a 
straight course to eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers to give heed to this compass, which would point 
unto them a straight course to the promised land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="45"></a>37:45</b>   And now I say, is there not a type in this thing?  For just as surely as this director did 
bring our fathers, by following its course, to the promised land, shall the words of Christ, if we follow 
their course, carry us beyond this vale of sorrow into a far better land of promise. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="46"></a>37:46</b>   O my son, do not let us be slothful because of the easiness of the way; for so was it with our 
fathers; for so was it prepared for them, that if they would look they might live; even so it is with us.  The 
way is prepared, and if we will look we may live forever. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="47"></a>37:47</b>   And now, my son, see that ye take care of these sacred things, yea, see that ye look to God 
and live.  Go unto this people and declare the word, and be sober.  My son, farewell. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
