He had 7 sons, 3 daughters, thousands of animals, and many slaves. <a href="1.html#1">1:1-4</a>

<p><li>God makes a bet with his son, Satan, telling Satan to do nasty things to Job to see if he can get Job to curse God to his face. 
<a href="1.html#6">1:6-12</a>

<p><li>Job's slaves and animals are burned to death or killed with swords. Then Job's children 
are killed in a windstorm while partying. <a href="1.html#13">1:13-19</a>

<p><li>God kills (or allows Satan to kill) Job's children, but Job doesn't "foolishly" blame God. <a href="1.html#20">1:20-22</a>

<p><li>He allows Satan to torment Job, just to see how he will react. <a href="2.html#">2:3-7</a>

  <p><li>He gives Job to Satan, saying: &quot;Behold, all that he hath is in thy
    power.&quot; <A  href="2.html#6">2:6</A>
    
  <p><li>Satan (or God) smites Job with boils from the &quot;sole of his foot unto his crown.&quot; <A href="2.html#7" >2:7</A>
  
  <p><li>Job's wife says that to retain his integrity he should &quot;curse God and die.&quot; <A href="2.html#9" >2:9</A>
  
  <p><li>Job curses the day he was born. <A href="3.html#1" >3:1-2</A>, <A href="3.html#11" >3:11</A>
  
  <p><li>God multiplies wounds without cause, destroys the perfect along with the wicked, laughs at the trial of the innocent, 
  and hides the truth from judges. <A href="9.html#17" >9:17-24</A>
  
  <p><li>After God and Satan get done tormenting Job, God gave Job even more stuff than he had before, including children. God gave 
  Job another set of 10 kids, with even prettier daughters! <a href="42.html#13">42:13-15</a>
