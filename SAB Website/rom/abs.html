<p><li>Atheists have dark and foolish hearts. <a href="1.html#21">1:21</a>

<p><li>"If thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision."<br>
If you are circumcised and you break the law, your foreskin will grow back. <a href="2.html#25">2:25</a>

<p><li>Paul asks the very good question: "Is there unrighteousness who taketh vengeance [upon innocent people]?" The
obvious answer to this is, yes. Paul then quickly adds, "I speak as a man." What else could he speak as? A donkey or a
god, perhaps? <a href="3.html#5">3:5</a>

<p><li>Paul says that Abraham needed God's help to father Isaac when he was 100 years old. But Abraham, when he was
even older, managed to father six more children with a new wife without any divine assistance 
(<a href="../gen/21.html#2">Gen 21:2</a>, <a href="../gen/25.html#1">25:1-2</a>). <a href="4.html#19">4:19</a>

<p><li>The guilty are "justified" and "saved from wrath" by the blood of an innocent victim.
 <a href="5.html#9">5:9</a>
 
 <p><li>"If ... we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son", then God is truly a monster. <a href="5.html#10">5:10</a>
 
 <p><li>God punishes everyone for someone else's sin; then he saves them by killing an innocent victim.
 <a href="5.html#12">5:12</a>
 
 <p><li>God gave the law so "that the offence might abound."  <a href="5.html#20">5:20</a>
 
<p><li>There is nothing good about Paul. <a href="7.html#18">7:18</a>

<p><li>"They that are in the flesh cannot please God." <a href="8.html#8">8:8</a>

<p><li>If Christ be in you, the body is dead. <a href="8.html#10">8:10</a>

<p><li>God intercedes with God by talking to, and sometimes even arguing with, himself.
 <a href="8.html#27">8:27</a>
 
 <p><li>"All things work together for good to them that love God."<br>
    One of the greatest and most absurd lies in all of scripture. <a href="8.html#28">8:28</a>
    
    <p><li>If you are a child of the flesh, you are not the seed of God. Whatever that might be. <a href="9.html#8">9:8</a>
 
<p><li>Paul says that everyone, even in his day, had the gospel preached to them. Even the Native Americans, Asians,
Pacific Islanders?  <a href="10.html#18">10:18</a>

<p><li>"Salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them [the Jews] to jealousy." <a href="11.html#11">11:11</a>

<p><li>"This is my covenant unto them</i>, [the Jews] when I shall take away their sins." <br>
Someday God will take away all Jewish sins. <a href="11.html#27">11:27</a>

<p><li>"As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, 
they are beloved for the father's sakes."<br>
Jews are enemies to Christians, but God loves them  for their ancestors' sake. <a href="11.html#28">11:28</a>

<p><li>Gentiles used to be unbelievers, but now the Jews are the unbelievers and God saves gentiles through Jewish unbelief. It's all a part of 
God's plan. <a href="11.html#30">11:30</a>

<p><li> Non-believing Jews will obtain mercy through the mercy of believers. <a href="11.html#31">11:31</a>

<p><li>"God hath concluded them [the Jews] all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all."  <a href="11.html#32">11:32</a>

<p><li>"Rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil."<br>
If you behave yourself, no king or government will mistreat you. <a href="13.html#3">13:3</a>

<p><li>It is wrong to borrow money. <a href="13.html#8">13:8</a>
