<h3>Christian Responses to the SAB</h3>


<p>There are several web sites that have responded to the SAB. The ones that I know about are listed below. Please let me 
know if there are any that I have overlooked. 

<p>[I am especially interested in responses from Christians on the 
<a href="cruelty/long.html">Cruelty and Violence list</a>. These verses show that the Bible could not have been inspired by a 
kind and loving God. They are the ones that are most likely to challenge the faith of those who believe in (or who pretend 
to believe in) the Bible but have never read it.

<p>I'd also like to see responses from Muslims and Mormons to the verses that are highlighted at the SAQ and SABoM.]

<ul>
<p><li><a href="http://sabdiscussionboard.yuku.com/forums/2/t/Contradictions.html">SAB Discussion Board</a><br>
I encourage apologists to visit the forum and respond to the verses that are 
highlighted at the SAB. Waterrock has 
completed posting responses for the gospel of Matthew and he has provided Christian commentary to the first eleven surahs of 
the Quran. Links to his responses can be found at the bottom of each chapter page at the SAB and on the 
surah sidebar at the SAQ. 

<p>[December 20, 2006: Since it appears that Waterrock is no longer responding to the SAB, I encourage other 
apologists to respond. Send me an email (swwells@gmail.com) if you're interested.]

<p><li><a href="http://reannotated.blogspot.com/">The Annotated Skeptic's Annotated Bible</a><br>
This site is in blog form, so it doesn't have separate entries for each SAB 
entry. The author has responded to Genesis and the first few chapters of Exodus.

<p><li><a href="http://www.berenddeboer.net/sab/index.html">The SAB Author Answered</a><br>
Responses from Genesis to Revelation have been completed. (I haven't yet added 
all the links.)<p><li><a href="http://www.lookinguntojesus.net/answering.htm">LookingUntoJesus.net: Answering the Atheist</a><br>
Since the responses are listed by week, they are bit hard to find. But the site has been doing one a week for nearly five years, 
so responses to most of the SAB's contradictions can be found there.

<p><li><a href="http://skepticsannotatedbiblerespons.blogspot.com/">Skeptic's Annotated Bible: A Response</a><br>
Some of the contradictions (about 100) have individual responses here.

<p><li><a href="http://danofisrael.com/id80.html">Dan of Israel: Response to the Skeptic's Annotated Bible</a><br>
Responses to about 100 of the SAB's contradictions can be found here.<br>
(I guess Dan of Israel has taken his site down.)

<p><li><a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/skeptics-annotated-Bible.html">Got Questions: What is the Skeptic's Annotated 
Bible?</a><br>

The "<a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/">Got Questions?</a>" site has a page on the SAB, but does not address specific 
highlighted verses. 

<p><li><a href="http://thedaystar.webs.com/index.html">The Pathway Machine</a> has a response to the SAB</a>.

<p><li><a href="http://www.tektonics.org">Tektonics.org</a><br>

This site defends the Bible by attacking me, which I find very entertaining. Some of the comments are so 
much fun that I've added them directly at the bottom of the chapter pages.

<p>Turkel (aka James Patrick Holding) has 
<a href="http://www.tektonics.org/sab/sab.html">decided to remove his comments</a> on 
the SAB from his Tektonics site. He'll now address the SAB at his new 
<a href="http://www.tektoonics.com/etc/parody/sab.html">Tektoonics</a> cartoon site The same "the 
SAB is such a weenie" apologetics can be found there.

<p>I guess Turkel has decided to remove all links from his site (or the Tektoonics site) to his responses. So I will begin removing them from the SAB 
as well. If he ever decides to make his responses available again, I'll do likewise. (13 December 2007)

<p><li><a href="http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.org">Jason Gastrich's commercial .org response to the SAB</a><br>
You've got to pay for Jason's stuff. (And it's not worth it. The free sites that are listed above do a much better job.) 
Still, I encourage Dr. Gastrich to make his material available on the web so that I can provide direct links from the SAB.<br>
15 November 2009 note: Dr. Gastrich has made his response to 
the SAB available online for free. <a href="http://jcsm.org/sabce/">Here</a> is the link. 



<p><li>Did I miss your response? If so, let me know and I'll provide links to it from the SAB.

<p><li>I also consider guest posts to my blog (<a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/">Dwindling in Unbelief</a>). Send me an email if you're 
interested. <br>(See <a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2009/10/bad-news-bears-guest-post-from-brucker.html">here</a> for a post 
from <a href="http://reannotated.blogspot.com/">Brucker</a>.)
