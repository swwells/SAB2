Women, sex, and babies are all evil to God. <a href="51.html#5">51:5</a>

 <p><li>God sent a plague on the Israelites for "committing whoredom with the daughters of Moab." But

says 23,000) had died. (See <a href="../num/25.html#6">Numbers 25:6-9</a> for all the gory details.)

<p><li>The psalmist asks God to do all sorts of unpleasant things to his enemies. "Set thou a wicked man over

kill him, and have his children suffer for the sins of their fathers.
