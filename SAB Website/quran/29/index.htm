Do men imagine that they will be left (at ease) because they say, We believe,  and will not be tested with affliction ? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Lo! We tested those who were before you. Thus Allah knoweth those who  are sincere, and knoweth those who feign. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Or do those who do ill-deeds imagine that they can outstrip Us ? Evil (for  them) is that which they decide. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Whoso looketh forward to the meeting with Allah (let him know that) Allah's  reckoning is surely nigh, and He is the Hearer, the Knower. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

And Abraham! (Remember) when he said unto his folk: Serve Allah, and  keep your duty unto Him; that is better for you if ye did but know. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
