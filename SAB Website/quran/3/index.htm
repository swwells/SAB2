Beautified for mankind is love of the joys (that come) from women and  offspring; and stored-up heaps of gold and silver, and horses

(The same are) those who say: Lo! Allah hath charged us that we believe not  in any messenger until he bring us an offering which fire (from heaven) shall devour.  Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Messengers came unto you before me with miracles,  and with that (very miracle) which ye describe. Why then did ye slay them ? (Answer  that) if ye are truthful!

Assuredly ye will be tried in your property and in your persons, and ye will  hear much wrong from those who were given the Scripture before you, and from the  idolaters. But if ye persevere and ward off (evil), then that is of the steadfast heart of  things.
