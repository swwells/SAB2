<a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a> <br>
(15:1, 2, 5, 6, 19, 20, 21, 32)

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (15:1-11)

<p>(15:1-7) Remember back in <a href="8.html">chapter 8</a> when Lehi had a dream about a tree? Yeah, 
well, it's back again. And this time it's causing trouble for Nephi's brothers.

<p>You see, they just couldn't figure it all out. What was it, anyway? And who cares? A crazy old man dreams about a tree and they're supposed to believe it has some cosmic significance, some deep spiritual meaning?

<p>Well, yes they are. This is the Book of Mormon after all.

<p>(15:1) <i>"And it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had been carried away in the spirit, and seen all these things, I returned to the tent of 
my father."</i> 

<p>(15:2) <i>"And it came to pass that I beheld my brethren, and they were disputing one with another concerning the things my father had 
spoken unto them."</i>

<p>(15:6) <i>"And it came to pass that after I had received strength I spake unto my brethren, desiring to know of them the cause of their 
disputations."</i>

<p>(15:7) <i>"And they said: Behold, we cannot understand the words which our father hath spoken concerning the natural branches of the olive-tree, 
and also concerning the Gentiles."</i>

<p>(15:8-9) Of course the main problem with Nephi's brothers was that they didn't inquire of the Lord enough. It's nearly impossible to 
believe complete and obvious bullshit without God's help.

<p><i>"And I [Nephi] said unto them: Have ye inquired of the Lord? And they said unto me: We have not. "</i>

<p>(15:10-11) Another reason they didn't believe the stuff about the tree is 
that they were such evil bastards. They didn't follow the commandments and their hearts were way too hard.

<p><i>"Behold, I [Nephi] said unto them: How is it that ye do not keep the commandments of the Lord? How is it that ye will perish, 
because of the hardness of your hearts? Do ye not remember the things which the Lord hath said? -- If ye will not harden your hearts, 
and ask me in faith, believing that ye shall receive, with diligence in keeping my commandments, surely these things shall be made 
known unto you."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (15:13) <a href="diu_list.html">Dwindling in unbelief</a>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif">
<img src="../../images/pr1.gif"> (15:13-14)

<p>(15:13) So Nephi explained it all to them again. The grafting of the 
branches thing is all about Joseph Smith who will (2423 years later) find and translate the golden plates and thereby produce the 
Book of Mormon that will bring "the fulness of the gospel" to the Gentiles. (And if that isn't perfectly obvious to you, you are 
an evil bastard that hasn't inquired of the Lord.)

<p><i>"The thing which our father meaneth concerning the grafting  ... is, that in the latter days, when our seed shall 
have dwindled in unbelief ... after the Messiah shall be manifested ...shall the fulness of the gospel of the 
Messiah come unto the Gentiles, and from the Gentiles unto the remnant of our seed."</i>

<p>(15:14) Nephi says that someday the Native Americans (who centuries later 
will become a dark, loathsome, filthy, idle, and abominable people for dwindling in unbelief) will all become Mormons and be saved. 
(I suppose God will then make them fair , white, and delightsome like good Mormons are today.)

<p><i>"At that day shall the remnant of our seed know that they are of 
the house of Israel, and that they are the covenant people of the Lord; and ... they 
shall come to the knowledge of their Redeemer and ... be saved."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32"> (15:20) Nephi goes on to explain the tree, iron rod, and river to his 
hard-hearted evil brothers.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that I did speak many words unto my brethren, that they were pacified and did humble themselves before the Lord."</i>

in of the natural branches through the fulness of the Gentiles, <span class="p">is, that in the latter 
days, when our seed shall have </span><span class="a">dwindled in unbelief</span>, yea, for the space of many years, 
and many generations <span class="p">after the Messiah shall be manifested</span> in body unto the children of 
men, then <span class="p">shall the fulness of the gospel of the Messiah come unto the Gentiles, and from 
the Gentiles unto the remnant of our seed </span>-- </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="14">15:14</b></a>   And <span class="p">at that day shall the remnant of our seed know that they are of 
the house of Israel, and that they are the covenant people of the Lord; and</span> then shall 
they know and come to the knowledge of their forefathers, and also to the knowledge of the 
gospel of their Redeemer, which was ministered unto their fathers by him; wherefore, <span class="p">they 
shall come to the knowledge of their Redeemer</span> and the very points of his doctrine, that 
they may know how to come unto him <span class="p">and be saved.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="15">15:15</b></a>   And then at that day will they not rejoice and give praise unto their 
everlasting God, their rock and their salvation? Yea, at that day, will they not receive 
the strength and nourishment from <span class="plag">the true vine</span>? Yea, will they not come unto the true 
fold of God? 

<tr><td><b><a name="16">15:16</b></a>   Behold, I say unto you, Yea; they shall be remembered again among the 
house of Israel; they shall be grafted in, being a natural branch of the olive-tree, into 
the true olive-tree. 

<tr><td><b><a name="17">15:17</b></a>   And this is what our father meaneth; and he meaneth that it will not 
come to pass until after they are scattered by the Gentiles; and he meaneth that it shall 
come by way of the Gentiles, that the Lord may show his power unto the Gentiles, for the 
very cause that he shall be rejected of the Jews, or of the house of Israel. 

<tr><td><b><a name="18">15:18</b></a>   Wherefore, our father hath not spoken of our seed alone, but also of 
all the house of Israel, pointing to the covenant which should be fulfilled in the latter 
days; which covenant the Lord made to our father Abraham, saying: In thy seed shall all 
the kindreds of the earth be blessed. 

<tr><td><b><a name="19">15:19</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that I, Nephi, spake much 
unto them concerning these things; yea, I spake unto them concerning the restoration of 
the Jews in the latter days. 

<tr><td><b><a name="20">15:20</b></a>   And I did rehearse unto them the words of Isaiah, who spake concerning 
the restoration of the Jews, or of the house of Israel; and after they were restored they 
should no more be confounded, neither should they be scattered again. <span class="a">And 
it came to pass that I did speak many words unto my brethren, that they were 
pacified and did humble themselves before the Lord. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="21">15:21</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they did speak unto 
me again, saying: What meaneth this thing which our father saw in a dream? What meaneth 
the tree which he saw? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">


<tr><td><b><a name="22">15:22</b></a>   And I said unto them: It was a representation of the tree of 
life. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23">15:23</b></a>   And they said unto me: What meaneth the rod of iron which our father 
saw, that led to the tree? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24">15:24</b></a>   And I said unto them that it was the 
word of God, and whose would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it, 
they would never perish; neither could the temptations and <span class="plag">the fiery darts of the 
adversary</span> overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to destruction. <td bgcolor="eeeeee" rowspan="13">

<p>(15:28) There's an "awful gulf" that separates the wicked from 
the saints.

<p><i>"I said unto them that it was an awful gulf, which separated the wicked from the tree of life, and also from the saints of God."</i>

<p>(15:33) If your works are filthy, then you are filthy. And if you're filthy, you can't go to heaven because 
you'd make God's kingdom filthy.

<p><i>"Wherefore, if they should die in their wickedness they must be cast off also ... to be judged of their works; and 
if their works have been filthiness they must needs be filthy; and if they be filthy it must needs be that they cannot 
dwell in the kingdom of God; if so, the kingdom of God must be filthy also."</i>

<p>(15:34) But, you see, the kingdom of God isn't filthy, 
so God had to make a filthy place to put filthy people after they die.

<p><i>"But behold, I say unto you, the kingdom of God is not filthy, and there cannot any unclean thing enter into the kingdom of God; 
wherefore there must needs be a place of filthiness prepared for that which is filthy."</i>

<tr><td><b><a name="25">15:25</b></a>   Wherefore, I, Nephi, did exhort them to give heed unto the word of the 
Lord; yea, I did exhort them with all the energies of my soul, and with all the faculty 
which I possessed, that they would give heed to the word of God and remember to keep his 
commandments always in all things. 

<tr><td><b><a name="26">15:26</b></a>   And they said unto me: What meaneth the river of water which our

saw was filthiness; and so much was his mind swallowed up in other things that he beheld 
not the filthiness of the water.

<span class="i">prepared for the wicked</span>. 

<tr><td><b><a name="30">15:30</b></a>   And I said unto them that our father also saw that the justice of God 
did also divide the wicked from the righteous; and the brightness thereof was like unto 
the brightness of a flaming fire, which <span class="plag">ascendeth up unto God forever and 
ever</span>, and hath no end.

in the days of probation, or doth it mean the final state of the soul after the death of 
the temporal body, or doth it speak of the things which are temporal? 

<tr><td><b><a name="32">15:32</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that I said unto them that 
it was a representation of things both temporal and spiritual; for the day should come 
that they must be judged of their works, yea, even the works which were done by the 
temporal body in their days of probation. 

<tr><td><b><a name="33">15:33</b></a>   <span class="i">Wherefore, if they should die in their wickedness they must be cast

their works have been filthiness they must needs be filthy; and if they be filthy it must 
needs be that they cannot dwell in the kingdom of God; if so, the kingdom of God must be 
filthy also.</span>
