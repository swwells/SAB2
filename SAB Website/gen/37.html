    Jacob loved Joseph more than his other children, and he made it pretty obvious. So the other kids 
    in the family hated Joseph. (God didn't seem to mind; he liked Joseph best, too.)

  These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was
    feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of
    Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought
    unto his father their evil report.

  <tr><td><B><A name="10">37:10</A></B>
  And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked

    and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to
    the earth?<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
