  After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one
    measure, and one size.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="38">7:38</A></B>
  Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and
    every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases one laver.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="39">7:39</A></B>
  And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left
    side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house
    eastward over against the south.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made
    an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the
    LORD:<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="41">7:41</A></B>
  The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top
    of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the
    chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars;<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="42">7:42</A></B>
  And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of
    pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that
    were upon the pillars;<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="43">7:43</A></B>
  And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="44">7:44</A></B>
  And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="45">7:45</A></B>
  And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels,
    which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of bright
    brass.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="46">7:46</A></B>
  In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between
    Succoth and Zarthan.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="47">7:47</A></B>
  And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding
    many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="48">7:48</A></B>
  And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the
    LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread was,<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="49">7:49</A></B>
  And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the
    left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of
    gold,<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="50">7:50</A></B>
  And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the
    censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the
    inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of
    the temple.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="51">7:51</A></B>
  So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the
    LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had
    dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among
    the treasures of the house of the LORD.
