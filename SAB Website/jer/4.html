<img src="../images/cr1.gif" width="32" height="32"> (4:25-28)<br>What was once fruitful is now barren.  Birds have fled, people are 
gone, towns are in ruins.  All "by his (God's) fierce anger."

I have purposed it, and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it."</i>

  I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and <span class="v">all the cities
    thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce
    anger.</span>

  The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they
    shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city shall be
    forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.

  And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself
    with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou
    rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy
    lovers will despise thee, they will seek thy life.

  For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the anguish as of
    her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion,
    that bewaileth herself, that spreadeth her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for
    my soul is wearied because of murderers.
