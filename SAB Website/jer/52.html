  Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he
    reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal the
    daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="2">52:2</A></B>

  For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah,

    the king of Babylon.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="4">52:4</A></B>
  And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in
    the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and
    all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built forts
    against it round about.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was
    sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="7">52:7</A></B>
  Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth
    out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which
    was by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the city round about:)
    and they went by the way of the plain.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook
    Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="9">52:9</A></B>
