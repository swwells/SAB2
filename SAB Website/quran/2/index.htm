<img src="../../images/interp.gif"> <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/004.smt.html#004.1707">Muhammad said</a> that Satan runs away 
from any house in which this surah is recited.

<p><img src="../../images/interp.gif">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (2:1) <i>"Alif. Lam. Mim."</i><br>
Many surahs start with three Arabic letters. No one knows why. But I have a theory.
The mysterious letters (Alif. Lam. Mim.) are the Quranic equivalent of WTF.

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (2:2) <i>"This is the Scripture whereof there is no doubt, a guidance unto those who  
ward off (evil)."</i><br>
There is no doubt about this or any other "Scripture". It is false. It wasn't revealed by God and it won't "ward off evil."

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (2:3-5) <i>"Who believe in the Unseen ... And who believe in that which is revealed unto thee (Muhammad) 
... and are certain of the Hereafter ... These are the successful."</i><br>
Those who believe in the unseen things revealed by Muhammad and who are absolutely certain they will survive their own death are  
the successful people. You know, the Muslims.

Allah hath sealed their hearing and their hearts, and on their eyes there is a covering. Theirs will be an awful doom."</i><br>
Don't bother warning the disbelievers. Allah has made it 
impossible for them to believe so that he can torture them forever after they die.<br>

<img src="../../images/inj1.gif" > (2:10) <i>"In their hearts is a disease, and Allah increaseth their 
disease. A painful doom is theirs because they lie."</i><br>
Allah has sickened the hearts of disbelievers and increased 
their disease. He is a spiritual anti-doctor. <br>
<a href="../topics/doom.html">Doom in the Quran</a>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" >
(2:13) <i>"Shall we believe as the foolish believe?"</i><br>
According to the Quran, the answer is, yes. To be truly wise you must believe 
whatever the foolish believe. 

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (2:14) <i>"When they fall in with those who believe, they say: 
We believe; but when they go apart to their devils they declare: Lo! we are with you; verily we did but mock."</i><br>
Allah especially dislikes people who pretend to 
believe when they're around Muslims, and then disbelieve when they hang out with devils.

<p><img src="../../images/inj1.gif" >(2:15) <i>"Allah doth mock them, leaving them to wander 
blindly."</i><br>
Allah mocks unbelievers, "leaving them to wander blindly."

<img src="../../images/contra1.gif" >(2:17-18) <i>"Allah taketh away their light and leaveth them in  
darkness, where they cannot see, Deaf, dumb and blind."</i><br>
Allah has blinded the disbelievers.<br>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (2:23) <i>"And if ye are in doubt ... then produce a surah of the like thereof."</i><br>
If you doubt that the truth of the Quran, then try making some stuff up and see how it compares. 
(Whatever you come up with will be better than the Quran.)<br>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-jPA20g91Y">How about this one?</a> <br>

<img src="../../images/inj1.gif" > (2:24) <i>"And if ye do it not - and ye can never do it - then guard 
yourselves against the Fire prepared for disbelievers, whose fuel is of men and stones."</i><br>
If you try to compose a surah that is better than those in the Quran, and then fail, Allah will burn you forever if you in the fire 
that he has prepared for disbelievers, whose fuel is men and stones.<br>
<a href="../topics/fire.html">The Fire</a>

<p><img src="../../images/sex1.gif" >
<img src="../../images/wom1.gif" > (2:25) <i>"There for them are pure companions."</i><br>
Virgins await those who enter paradise.

Then turned He to the heaven."</i><br>
<a href="../contra/first.html">Which was created first, heaven or earth?</a>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (2:29b) <i>"Then turned He to 
the  heaven, and fashioned it as seven heavens."</i><br>
Allah created seven heavens. 

<p><img src="../../images/cr1.gif"> 
<img src="../../images/inj1.gif">(2:30) <i>"The angels ... said: Wilt thou ... do harm therein and ... shed blood, 
while we, we hymn Thy praise and sanctify Thee ? He said: Surely I know that which ye know not."</i><br>
Allah will shed human blood while angels praise him in heaven. (The angels question why Allah has to kill people; Allah says 
they'd understand if they knew everything like he does.)

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"><img src="../../images/sci1.gif"> (2:31a) <i>"He taught Adam all the names."</i><br>
Allah taught Adam all the names of the plants and animals, which must have taken a while since there are 1.7 million species that are known, 
with probably another 10 million or so that are yet to be discovered. And this only includes those that are alive today. If extinct species 
are included (~99%), then Allah must have taught Adam a billion or so names.

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (2:31b) <i>"Then [he] showed them to the angels, saying: Inform Me of the names of these, 
if ye are truthful."</i><br>
Then Allah showed all the animals to the angels, challenging them to guess their names (if 
they are truthful).

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (2:32) <i>"They said: Be glorified! We have no knowledge saving that which Thou hast taught us."</i><br>
But the angels weren't truthful enough to guess correctly.

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (2:33) <i>"He said: O Adam! Inform them of their names, and when he had informed them of their names, He said: ... I know that which ye 
disclose and which ye hide."</i><br>
Then Allah tells Adam to tell the angels the animals' names. So Adam tells them and says, 
"I know something you guys don't! Neener-Neener-Neener!"

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" >
<img src="../../images/contra1.gif" width="32" height="32"> (2:34) <i>"We said unto the angels: Prostrate yourselves before Adam, they fell prostrate, all save Iblis. He demurred through pride, and so 
became a disbeliever."</i><br>
Allah commands the angels to worship Adam. They all do, except for 
Iblis, who becomes a disbeliever.<br>
<a href="../contra/obey.html">Does everything obey Allah?</a><br>
<a href="../contra/iblis.html">Is Iblis an angel or a jinn?</a>

<p><img src="../../images/inj1.gif">
<img src="../../images/cr1.gif"> (2:48) <br>Someday Allah will refuse all prayers and help no one.

<p><i>"Guard yourselves against a day when no soul will in aught avail another,  nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will 
compensation be received from it, nor will they be helped."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/cr1.gif"> (2:50) Allah brags about drowning the Egyptian army.

<p><i>"We ... drowned the folk of the Pharaoh in your sight."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (2:54a) After the people worshipped a calf, Moses told them to 
kill themselves. That, he said, would be best for them.

<p><i>"Moses said unto his people ... Ye have wronged yourselves 
by your choosing of the calf  ... kill (the guilty) yourselves. That will be best for you."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/contra1.gif" > (2:54b) <i>"He is the Relenting, the Merciful."</i><br>
<a href="../contra/merciful.html">Is Allah kind and merciful?</a>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (2:55-56) Allah struck Moses with lightning and then revived him just so that Moses would 
thank him for it!

<p><i>"When ye said: O Moses! We will not believe in thee till we see Allah plainly; and even while ye gazed the lightning seized you. 
Then We revived you ... that ye might give thanks."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (2:60) As you read the Quran you'll notice that many of the Bible's stupidest stories are made even 
stupider in the Quran. Take <a href="../../ex/17.html#1">Exodus 17:1-6</a> for example. In the Bible, Moses strikes a rock and water 
comes out for the Israelites to drink. In the Quran, the same thing happens but there are twelve springs that come out of the rock, 
one for each tribe of Israel.

<p><i>"When Moses asked for water for his people, We said: Smite with thy staff the rock. And there 
gushed out therefrom twelve springs (so that) each tribe knew their drinking-place."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/inj1.gif" >
<img src="../../images/int.gif" > (2:61) Allah stamped wretchedness upon the Jews because they killed 
the prophets and disbelieved Allah's revelations.

<p><i>"Humiliation and wretchedness were stamped upon them and they 
were visited with wrath from Allah. That was because they disbelieved in Allah's 
revelations and slew the prophets."</i>

<img src="../../images/inj1.gif" >(2:65-66) Allah turned Sabbath-breaking Jews into apes to be 
despised and hated. All modern Jews are descendants of apes (or all modern apes are descendants of Sabbath-breaking Jews).

<p><i>"Ye know of those of you who broke the Sabbath, how We said unto them: Be ye apes, despised and hated! And We made it an example to 
their own and to succeeding generations"</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (2:67-69) Allah told the Jews to sacrifice a bright yellow cow.

<p><i>"Allah commandeth you that ye sacrifice a cow, they said: Dost thou make game of us? He 
answered: Allah forbid that I should be among the foolish! ... They said: Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us what (cow) 
she is. ... Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us of what colour she is. (Moses) answered: Lo! He saith: Verily she is a 
yellow cow. Bright is her colour, gladdening beholders."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (2:70) But they weren't sure what cow to kill. All cows pretty much look alike to Jews.

<p><i>"They said: Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us what (cow) she is. Lo! cows are 
much alike to us; and Lo! if Allah wills, we may be led aright."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (2:71) Somehow they worked it all out, though, and killed a yellow cow.

<p><i>"So they sacrificed her, though almost they did not."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (2:72-73) A man was murdered about the same time that the yellow 
cow was killed. Nobody knew who the murderer was. So Allah told the people to smite the dead man with a piece of the dead cow. When 
they did that, the dead man came to life and told everyone who had murdered him. (I hope I got that right.)

<p><i>"Remember when ye slew a man and disagreed concerning it and 
Allah brought forth that which ye were hiding. And We said: Smite him with some of it. Thus Allah bringeth the dead to life."</i><br>
