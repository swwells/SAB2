<p><li>The phrase "as it is written in the prophets" is not found in the oldest and best Greek manuscripts which say, rather,
 "as it is written in Isaiah." Scribes made the change to correct the mistake of attributing the quotation to Isaiah, since 
 the first part of the quote (v.2) is not from Isaiah, but from <a href="../ex/23.html#20">Ex 23:20</a> and 
 <a href="../mal/3.html#1">Mal 3:1</a>. <a href="1.html#2">1:2</a>
 
<p><li>The first pope was married.  <a href="1.html#30">1:30</a>

<p><li>"Jesus, moved with compassion"<br>
    Some of the earliest manuscripts of Mark say that Jesus was moved with anger, not compassion. Bart Ehrman in 
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060738170/skepticsannotate">Misquoting Jesus</a> (p.133-138) argues that 
    the original text probably said that Jesus reacted with wrath rather than compassion, and was later changed by scribes to 
    make the verse less problematic. <a href="1.html#41">1:41</a>

<p><li>"Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary?"<br>
This is the only verse in the New Testament where Jesus is referred to as a carpenter. And in the earliest manuscript of Mark, 
the verse says, "Is not this the son of the carpenter?" Apparently it wasn't in any of the Gospels at the time of Origen, 
who said that "in none of the Gospels current in the 
Churches is Jesus himself ever described as being a carpenter." <a href="6.html#3">6:3</a>

<p><li>"Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us?"<br>
Jesus had at least six siblings, four brothers and at least two sisters. Yet it is a doctine of the Catholic church that Mary was always a virgin. <a href="6.html#3">6:3</a>

<p><li>One of the followers of Jesus was a young, nearly naked man who dropped his linen cloth and "fled from them
naked" when the priests came to arrest Jesus.  <a href="14.html#51">14:51-52</a>

<p><li>Verses 9-20 were are not found in the earlier manuscripts and are therefore considered later 
additions. So the gospel of Mark ended without anyone seeing the resurrected Jesus or any of the cool stuff about snake 
handling, drinking poison, or damned non-believers. <a href="16.html#9">16:9-20</a>
