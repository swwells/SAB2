<img src="../../images/plag.gif" > (19:1-21) More Isaiah (<a href="../../is/9.html">Chapter 9</a>)

<p>(19:1) Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at
    the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,
    and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond
    Jordan, in Galilee of the nations. 
    
<br>(19:2) The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that
    dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.

<br>(19:3) Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy: they joy
    before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they
    divide the spoil.

<br>(19:4) For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his
    shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian.

<br>(19:5) For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments
    rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire.

<br>(19:6) For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government
    shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful,
    Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.

<br>(19:7) Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon
    the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it
    with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of
    the LORD of hosts will perform this.

<br>(19:8) The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel.

<br>(19:9) And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria,
    that say in the pride and stoutness of heart,

<br>(19:10) The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones: the
    sycomores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars.

<br>(19:11) Therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and
    join his enemies together;

<br>(19:12) The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour
    Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his
    hand is stretched out still.

<br>(19:13) For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do they
    seek the LORD of hosts.

<br>(19:14) Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and
    rush, in one day.

<br>(19:15) The ancient and honourable, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth
    lies, he is the tail.

<br>(19:16) For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they that are led of
    them are destroyed.

<br>(19:17) Therefore the LORD shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall
    have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for every one is an hypocrite and
    an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not
    turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
    
    <p><img src="../../images/inj1.gif" >
<img src="../../images/fv.gif" >
<img src="../../images/cr1.gif" > (19:17) <br>God will not have mercy on orphans or widows.

<p>(19:18) For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers and thorns,
    and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall mount up like
    the lifting up of smoke.

<br>(19:19) Through the wrath of
    the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel
    of the fire: no man shall spare his brother.
    
    <p><img src="../../images/inj1.gif" >
<img src="../../images/fv.gif" >
<img src="../../images/cr1.gif"> (19:19-20) <br>
God will make every man kill his brother and then force him to eat "the flesh of his own arm."

<p>(19:20) And he shall snatch
    on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and
    they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own
    arm:

<br>(19:21) Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together shall be
    against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is
    stretched out still.

the land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, and afterwards did more grievously afflict by the way of the Red Sea 
beyond Jordan in Galilee of the nations. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>19:2</b> <span class="plag">The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light; they that dwell in the land of the shadow 
of death, upon them hath the light shined. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>19:3</b> <span class="plag">Thou hast multiplied the nation, and increased the joy -- they joy before thee according to the joy in 
harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>19:4</b> <span class="plag">For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor.
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>19:5</b><span class="plag">   For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but this shall be 
with burning and fuel of fire. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>19:6</b><span class="plag">   For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and 
his name shall be called, Wonderful, Counselor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>19:7</b> <span class="plag">Of the increase of government and peace there is no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom 
to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth, even forever.  The zeal of the Lord of 
Hosts will perform this. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>19:8</b> <span class="plag">The Lord sent his word unto Jacob and it hath lighted upon Israel.
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>19:9</b> <span class="plag">And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, that say in the pride and 
stoutness of heart: </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>19:10</b> <span class="plag">The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones; the sycamores are cut down, but we will 
change them into cedars. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>19:11</b> <span class="plag">Therefore the Lord shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and join his enemies together;
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>19:12</b> <span class="plag">The Syrians before and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth.  For 
all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>19:13</b> <span class="plag">For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the Lord of Hosts.
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>19:14</b> <span class="plag">Therefore will the Lord cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush in one day.
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>19:15</b> <span class="plag">The ancient, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail.

  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>19:17</b>   <span class="i">Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither

anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>19:18</b> <span class="plag">For wickedness burneth as the fire; 
it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forests, and they shall mount up like 
the lifting up of smoke. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>19:19</b>   <span class="v">Through the wrath of the Lord of Hosts is the land darkened, 
and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire; no man shall spare his brother.</span>

not be satisfied; they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm --  </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>19:21</b><span class="plag">   Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; they together shall be against Judah.  For all this his
