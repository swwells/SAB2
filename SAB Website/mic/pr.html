<p><li>Watch out for lying prophets that bite (with their teeth). <a href="3.html#5">3:5</a>

<p><li>&quot;The prophets thereof divine for money.&quot; Some things never change. <a href="3.html#11">3:11</a>

<p><li> In the last days God will put "the mountain of the house of the Lord" on "top of the mountains." <a href="4.html#1">4:1</a>

<p><li> &quot;But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he 
come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.&quot;<BR>
The gospel of Matthew (<A href="../mt/2.html#5">2:5-6</A>) claims that Jesus'
birth in Bethlehem fulfils this prophecy. But this is unlikely for two reasons.
<OL type="i">

  <li>&quot;Bethlehem Ephratah&quot; in Micah 5:2 refers not to a town, but to a
    clan: the clan of Bethlehem, who was the son of Caleb's second wife,
    Ephrathah (<A href="../1chr/2.html#18">1 Chr 2:18</A>, <A
    href="../1chr/2.html#50">2:50-52</A>, <A href="../1chr/4.html#4">4:4</A>).
    
  <li>The prophecy (if that is what it is) does not refer to the Messiah, but
    rather to a military leader, as can be seen from verse <A href="5.html#6">5:6</A>.
    This leader is supposed to defeat the Assyrians, which, of course, Jesus
    never did.

It should also be noted that Matthew altered the text of Micah 5:2 by saying:
&quot;And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda&quot; rather than &quot;Bethlehem
Ephratah&quot; as is said in Micah 5:2. He did this, intentionally no doubt, to
make the verse appear to refer to the town of Bethlehem rather than the family
clan. <a href="5.html#2">5:2</a>
