<p><li>"We which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep." 
1 Thessalonians was one of the first Christian writings, yet already (ca.50 CE) believers were getting impatient 
about Jesus' supposed return. Their fellow believers were dying and yet Jesus still hadn't come. What the hell is 
taking him? And what happens to dead believers? Will they get to see Jesus return? Paul had a lot of 'splainin to do. <a href="4.html#15">4:15</a>

<p><li>"For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the
    voice of the archangel...." From this verse and <a href="../jude/1.html#9">Jude 9</a>, the Jehovah's Witnesses figure 
    that Jesus is really the archangel Michael. <a href="4.html#16">4:16</a>
