        The Lord set every man's sword against his fellow</a></b><br>
        Here's a story about Gideon. You know, the guy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gideon_Bible">they</a> named the Bible after.
       
       <p>It starts out in the usual way. The Israelites do evil in the sight of the Lord (6:1a); God forces the Israelites to be slaves (6:1b); 
       the Israelites cry out to God (6:7); God kills the guys he delivered them to (7:22). (The Midianites this time around. 
       See <a href="2.html#14">Judges 2:14</a>, <a href="3.html#8">3:8</a>, and 
       <a href="8.html#6">8:6</a> for other versions of the same story.)
              
       <p>(6:1) <i>"The children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and 
       the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years."</i>        
     
</font>


<tr><td><B><A name="1">6:1</A></B>
  And <span class="a">the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into
    the hand of Midian seven years.</span>     

  <tr><td><B><A name="2">6:2</A></B>
  And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the
    Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the
    mountains, and caves, and strong holds.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="3">6:3</A></B>
  And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the
    Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="4">6:4</A></B>
  And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth,
    till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep,
    nor ox, nor ass.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="5">6:5</A></B>
  For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and <span class="a">they came as grasshoppers for multitude;
    for both they and their camels were without number</span>: and they
