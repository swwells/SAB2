<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>11:24</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that in the eightieth year of the 
reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, there were a certain number of the dissenters from the people of 
Nephi, who had some years before gone over unto the Lamanites, and taken upon themselves the name of Lamanites, 
and also a certain number who were real descendants of the Lamanites, being stirred up to anger by them, or by 
those dissenters, therefore they commenced a war with their brethren. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>11:25</b>   And they did commit murder and plunder; and then they would retreat back into 
the mountains, and into the wilderness and secret places, hiding themselves that they could not be discovered, 
receiving daily an addition to their numbers, inasmuch as there were dissenters that went forth unto them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>11:26</b>   And thus in time, yea, even in the space of not many years, they became 
an <span class="a">exceedingly</span> great band of robbers; and they did search out all the secret plans 
of Gadianton; and thus they became robbers of Gadianton. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>11:27</b>   Now behold, these robbers did make great havoc, yea, even great destruction 
among the people of Nephi, and also among the people of the Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>11:28</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that it was expedient that there 
should be a stop put to this work of destruction; therefore they sent an army of strong men into the wilderness 
and upon the mountains to search out this band of robbers, and to destroy them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>11:29</b>   <span class="a">But behold, it came to pass</span> that in that same year 
they were driven back even into their own lands.  And thus ended the eightieth year of the reign of the judges 
over the people of Nephi. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>11:30</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> in the commencement of the eighty 
and first year they did go forth again against this band of robbers, and did destroy many; and they were also 
visited with much destruction. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>11:31</b>   And they were again obliged to return out of the wilderness and out of the 
mountains unto their own lands, because of the <span class="a">exceeding</span> greatness of the numbers of 
those robbers who infested the mountains and the wilderness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="32"></a>11:32</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that thus ended this year.  And the 
robbers did still increase and wax strong, insomuch that they did defy the whole armies of the Nephites, and 
also of the Lamanites; and they did cause great fear to come unto the people upon all the face of the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="33"></a>11:33</b>   Yea, for they did visit many parts of the land, and did do great destruction 
unto them; yea, did kill many, and did carry away others captive into the wilderness, yea, and more especially 
their women and their children. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="34"></a>11:34</b>   Now this great evil, which came unto the people because of their iniquity, 
did <span class="c">stir them up again in remembrance </span>of the Lord their God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

ways. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>
