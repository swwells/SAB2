may be unfolded to your view. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

chosen by this people, and consecrated by my father, and was suffered by the hand of the Lord that I should be a ruler 
and a king over this people; and have been kept and preserved by his matchless power, to serve you with all the might, 
mind and strength which the Lord hath granted unto me. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>2:12</b>   I say unto you that as I have been suffered to spend my days in your service, even up to this time, and 
have not sought gold nor silver nor any manner of riches of you; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>2:13</b>   Neither have I suffered that ye should be confined in dungeons, nor that ye should make slaves one of 
another, nor that ye should murder, or plunder, or steal, or commit adultery; nor even have I suffered that ye should 
commit any manner of wickedness, and have taught you that ye should keep the commandments of the Lord, in all things

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>2:24</b>   And secondly, he doth require that ye should do as he hath commanded you; for which if ye do, he doth 
immediately bless you; and therefore he hath paid you.  And ye are still indebted unto him, and are, and will be, 
forever and ever; therefore, of what have ye to boast? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>2:25</b>   And now I ask, can ye say aught of yourselves?  I answer you, Nay.  Ye cannot say that ye are even as 
much as the dust of the earth; yet ye were created of the dust of the earth; but behold, it belongeth to him who 
created you. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>2:26</b>   And I, even I, whom ye call your king, am no better than ye yourselves are; for I am also of the dust.  
And ye behold that I am old, and am about to yield up this mortal frame to its mother earth. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>2:27</b>   Therefore, as I said unto you that I had served you, walking with a clear conscience before God, 
even so I at this time have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together, that I might be found blameless, 
and that your blood should not come upon me, when I shall stand to be judged of God of the things whereof he hath 
commanded me concerning you. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>2:28</b> <span class="a">I say unto you that I have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together that I might rid my 
garments of your blood</span>, at this period of time when I am about to go down to my grave, that I might go down in peace, and 
my immortal spirit may join the choirs above in singing the praises of a just God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (2:28) <i>"I say unto you that I have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together that I might rid my 
garments of your blood."</i> King Benjamin assembled everyone in his kingdom to rid his garments of their blood. Good idea.
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>2:29</b>   And moreover, I say unto you that I have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together, that I 
might declare unto you that I can no longer be your teacher, nor your king; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>2:30</b>   For even at this time, my whole frame doth tremble <span class="a">exceedingly</span> while attempting 
to speak unto you; but the Lord God doth support me, and hath suffered me that I should speak unto you, and hath 
commanded me that I should declare unto you this day, that my son Mosiah is a king and a ruler over you. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>2:31</b>   And now, my brethren, I would that ye should do as ye have hitherto done.  As ye have kept my 
commandments, and also the commandments of my father, and have prospered, and have been kept from falling into 
the hands of your enemies, even so if ye shall keep the commandments of my son, or the commandments of God which 
shall be delivered unto you by him, ye shall prosper in the land, and your enemies shall have no power over you. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="32"></a>2:32</b>   But, O my people, beware lest there shall arise contentions among you, and ye list to obey the evil 
spirit, which was spoken of by my father Mosiah. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="33"></a>2:33</b>   For behold, there is a wo pronounced upon him who listeth to obey that spirit; for 
<span class="i">if he</span> listeth to obey him, and remaineth and <span class="i">dieth in his sins, the same drinketh 
damnation to his own soul; for he receiveth for his 
wages an everlasting punishment</span>, having transgressed the law of God contrary to his own knowledge. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Those who die in their sins are tormented forever in hell. 
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="34"></a>2:34</b>   I say unto you, that there are not any among you, except it be your little children that have not been 
taught concerning these things, but what knoweth that ye are eternally indebted to your heavenly Father, to render to 
him all that you have and are; and also have been taught concerning the records which contain the prophecies which have 
been spoken by the holy prophets, even down to the time our father, Lehi, left Jerusalem; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="35"></a>2:35</b>   And also, all that has been spoken by our fathers until now.   And behold, also, they spake that which 
was commanded them of the Lord; therefore, they are just and true. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="36"></a>2:36</b>   And now, I say unto you, my brethren, that after ye have known and have been taught all these things, 
if ye should transgress and go contrary to that which has been spoken, that ye do withdraw yourselves from the Spirit of 
the Lord, that it may have no place in you to guide you in wisdom's paths that ye may be blessed, prospered, and 
preserved --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="37"></a>2:37</b>   I say unto you, that the man that doeth this, the same cometh out in open rebellion 
against God; therefore he listeth to obey the evil spirit, and becometh an enemy to all righteousness; therefore, the Lord has 
no place in him, for he dwelleth not in unholy temples. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="38"></a>2:38</b>   Therefore if that man repenteth not, and remaineth and dieth an enemy to God, the 
demands of divine justice do awaken his immortal soul to a lively sense of his own guilt, which doth cause him to shrink 
from the presence of the Lord, and doth fill his breast with guilt, and pain, and anguish, which is like an unquenchable 
fire, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="39"></a>2:39</b>   And now I say unto you, that <span class="v">mercy hath no claim on that man; therefore his final 
doom is to endure a never-ending torment.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee" rowspan="2" valign="top">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/cr1.gif" >
<img src="../../images/inj1.gif" > (2:39) <i>"Mercy hath no claim on that man; therefore his final doom is to endure a never-ending torment."</i><br>
Those in hell "endure a never-ending torment. 
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="40"></a>2:40</b>   O, all ye old men, and also ye young men, and you little children who can 
understand my words, for I have spoken plainly unto you that ye might understand, I pray that ye should awake to a 
remembrance of the awful situation of those that have fallen into transgression. 

<tr><td><b><a name="41"></a>2:41</b>   And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that 
keep the commandments of God.  For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they 
hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of 
never-ending happiness.  <span class="a">O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it.
