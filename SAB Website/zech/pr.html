<p><li>"And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod." <a href="9.html#6">9:6</a>

<p><li>"I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth." <a href="9.html#7">9:7</a>

<p><li>The gospels (especially <a href="../mt/21.html#4">Mt 21:4-5</a> and <a href="../jn/12.html#14">Jn 12:14-15</a>) claim that Jesus fulfils the prophecy of 
<a href="../zech/9.html#9">Zech 9:9</a>. But the next few  verses (<a href="9.html#10">9:10-13</a>) show that the person referred to in this 
     verse is a military king that would rule "from sea to sea". Since  Jesus had neither an army or a kingdom, he could not have fulfilled this prophecy. 
     <a href="9.html#9">9:9</a>

<p><li>Israel shall never again be oppressed. Another obviously false prophecy; Israel has been occupied 
many times since the time of Zechariah. <a href="9.html#8">9:8</a>
     
<p><li>The river of Egypt (identified as the Nile in NIV, NASB, and RSV) shall dry up. This 
has never occurred. <a href="10.html#11">10:11</a>

<p><li>Matthew (<a href="../mt/27.html#9">27:9</a>) quotes this verse, but incorrectly attributes it to Jeremiah.
 <a href="11.html#12">11:12</a>

<p><li>God plans to expel the prophets and unclean spirits. Sounds like a good plan to me. 
<a href="13.html#2">13:2</a>

<p><li>Someday prophets will be killed by their own parents by "thrusting him through when he prophesieth." <a href="13.html#3">13:3</a>

<p><li>"The prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision." <a href="13.html#4">13:4</a>

<p><li>Somday there will be a day that will have neither day nor night with a bright sunny evening. <a href="14.html#7">14:7</a>

<p><li>"Living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: 
in summer and in winter shall it be." <a href="14.html#8">14:8</a>
