God tells the Israelites, through
the prophet Elisha, to implement a scorched earth policy on the Moabites.
"Strike every fortified city and every choice city, and fell every good tree</A> and stop all
springs of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.&quot; And they
carry out their instructions. (Well, OK, they did leave a few stones in
Kirharaseth.)<br>
