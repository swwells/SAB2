     After receiving the Levite's rotting concubine body part message (see <a href="19.html">the last chapter</a> for the gory details), the entire population of 
     Israel along with 400,000 soldiers gathered together to decide what to do about it. 
     
<p>(20:1) <i>"The children of Israel ... gathered together as one man ...  unto the LORD in Mizpeh."</i>

<p>(20:2) <i>"All the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword."</i>

<p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (20:3-6) When they arrived at Mizpeh, the Israelites asked the meaning of the rotting flesh messages. So the Levite told them the nasty story that 
is found in <a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/jg/19.html#22">Judges 19</a>, except that he left out the part about 
how <a href="19.html#25">he gave his concubine to the mob to do with as they pleased</a>. 

<p>(20:3) <i>"Then said the children of Israel, Tell us, how was this wickedness?"</i>

<p>(20:4) <i>"The Levite ... said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge."</i>

<p>(20:5) <i>"And the men of Gibeah rose against me ... and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead."</i>

<p>(20:6) <i>"And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country."</i>

<p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (20:8-9) When the Israelites heard this, they all said together in complete unison.

<p>(20:8) <i>"And all the people arose as one man, saying,"</i>

<p>(20:9) <i>"This shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we will go up by lot against it."</i>

<p>(God's just war theory: Since the town of Gibeah was where the incident with the concubine occurred, and the inhabitants of Gibeah
 were from the tribe of Benjamin, the other Israelite tribes must go to war with the Benjamites. This may not make much sense to you, 
 but it does to God.)
 
<p><IMG src="../images/cr1.gif" >
<IMG src="../images/inj1.gif" >
<IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (20:12-21) The Benjamites refuse to turn over the men from Gibeah (the town that wanted to have sex with the Levite but settled for 
     his concubine instead), so the Israelites asked God which tribe should go to war with them. God said the tribe of Judah 
     should go first. Judah goes to war and the Benjamites, with their 700 sharp shooting lefties, kill 22,000 Israelites.
     
     <p>(20:12) <i>"The tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?"</i>
     
     <p>(20:13) <i>"Deliver us the men ... which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death ... But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel."</i>

<p>(20:16) <i>"There were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth, 
     and not miss."</i>
     
<p>(20:18) <i>"The children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle 
against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said, Judah shall go up first."</i>
