repented of his sins and iniquities, and went about privately among the people, and began to teach the words of 
Abinadi --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>18:2</b>   Yea, concerning that which was to come, and also concerning the resurrection of the dead, and the 
redemption of the people, which was to be brought to pass through the power, and sufferings, and death of Christ, and 
his resurrection and ascension into heaven. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>18:3</b>   And as many as would hear his word he did teach.  And he taught them privately, that it might not come 
to the knowledge of the king.  And many did believe his words. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>18:4</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that as many as did believe him did go forth to a place 
which was called Mormon, having received its name from the king, being in the borders of the land having been 
infested, by times or at seasons, by wild beasts. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>18:5</b>   Now, there was in Mormon a fountain of pure water, and Alma resorted thither, there being near the 
water a thicket of small trees, where he did hide himself in the daytime from the searches of the king. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>18:6</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that as many as believed him went thither to hear his 
words. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>18:7</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> after many days there were a goodly number gathered 
together at the place of Mormon, to hear the words of Alma.  Yea, all were gathered together that believed on his 
word, to hear him.  And he did teach them, and did preach unto them repentance, and redemption, and faith on the 
Lord. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>18:8</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that he said unto them: Behold, here are the waters of 
Mormon (for thus were they called) and now, as ye are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his 
people, and are willing to bear one another's burdens, that they may be light; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>18:9</b>   Yea, and are willing to <span class="g">mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of 
comfort</span>, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even 
until death, that ye may be redeemed of God, and be numbered with those of the first resurrection, that ye may have 
eternal life --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>18:10</b>   Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being baptized in 
the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him 
and keep his commandments, that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>18:11</b>   And now when the people had heard these words, they clapped their hands for joy, and exclaimed: This 
is the desire of our hearts. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>18:12</b>   <span class="a">And now it came to pass</span> that Alma took Helam, he being one of the first, and went and stood forth 
in the water, and cried, saying: O Lord, pour out thy Spirit upon thy servant, that he may do this work with holiness 
of heart. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>18:13</b>   And when he had said these words, the Spirit of the Lord was upon him, and he said: Helam, I baptize 
thee, having authority from the Almighty God, as a testimony that ye have entered into a covenant to serve him until 
you are dead as to the mortal body; and may the Spirit of the Lord be poured out upon you; and may he grant unto you 
eternal life, through the redemption of Christ, whom he has <span class="plag">prepared from the foundation of the world</span>. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>18:14</b>   And after Alma had said these words, both Alma and Helam were buried in the water; and they arose and 
came forth out of the water rejoicing, being filled with the Spirit. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>18:15</b>   And again, Alma took another, and went forth a second time into the water, and baptized him according 
to the first, only he did not bury himself again in the water. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>18:16</b>   And after this manner he did baptize every one that went forth to the place of Mormon; and they were 
in number about two hundred and four souls; yea, and they were baptized in the waters of Mormon, and were filled with the grace of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>18:17</b>   And they were called the church of God, or the church of Christ, from that time 
forward.  <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that whosoever was baptized by the power and authority of God 
was added to his church. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>18:18</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Alma, having authority from God, ordained priests; 
even one priest to every fifty of their number did he ordain to preach unto them, and to teach them concerning the 
things pertaining to the kingdom of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>18:19</b>   And he commanded them that they should teach nothing save it were the things which he had taught, 
and which had been spoken by the mouth of the holy prophets. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>18:20</b>   Yea, even he commanded them that 
they should preach nothing save it were repentance and faith on the Lord, who had redeemed his people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>18:21</b>   And he commanded them that there should be no contention one with another, but that they should look 
forward with one eye, having <span class="plag">one faith and one baptism</span>, having their 
<span class="plag">hearts knit together in unity and in love</span> one 
towards another. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

one faith, one baptism -- <a href="../../eph/4.html#5">Ephesians 4:5</a>
<p>That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love -- <a href="../../col/2.html#2">Colossians 2:2</a></font>

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>18:22</b>   And thus he commanded them to preach.  And thus they became the children of 
God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>18:23</b>   And he commanded them that they should observe the sabbath day, and keep it holy, and also 
every day they should give thanks to the Lord their God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>18:24</b>   And he also commanded them that the priests whom he had ordained should labor with their own hands 
for their support. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>18:25</b>   And there was one day in every week that was set apart that they should gather themselves together 
to teach the people, and to worship the Lord their God, and also, as often as it was in their power, to assemble 
themselves together. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>18:26</b>   And the priests were not to depend upon the people for their support; but for their labor they were 
to receive the grace of God, that they might wax strong in the Spirit, having the knowledge of God, that they might 
teach with power and authority from God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>18:27</b>   And again Alma commanded that the people of the church should impart of their substance, every one 
according to that which he had; if he have more abundantly he should impart more abundantly; and of him that had 
but little, but little should be required; and to him that had not should be given. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>18:28</b>   And thus they should impart of their substance of their own free will and good desires towards God, 
and to those priests that stood in need, yea, and to every needy, naked soul. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>18:29</b>   And this he said unto them, having been commanded of God; and they did walk uprightly before God,
