<H3>Abraham</H3>
<ol>
<p>"The Lord had blessed Abraham in all things." Gen.24:1
(Check Heb.11, James2, and Rom.4 for more about Abraham. Note especially the contradiction between James 2 and Romans 4)

<p>Abraham asked his wife Sarah to tell the Egyptians that she was his sister. (Explain the reason for this. Check to see 
how old she was. She was then taken into Pharaoh's house and God plagued the Egyptians for this.)

<blockquote><p>And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I
    know that thou art a fair woman to look upon: 
    Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they
    will kill me, but they will save thee alive. 
    Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy
    sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
<a href="../gen/12.html#11">Genesis 12:11-13</a></blockquote>

<p>Gen.15:8-10 (Kills animals for God.)

<p>Gen.16:1-4 (Has sex with Hagar.)

<p>Gen.16:6 -- Sarai gets jealous. Abraham tells Sarai to do what ever she wants to Hagar.

<p>Gen.17:23 --Circumcised at the age of 99.

<p>Gen.17:23 -- Owns many slaves

<p>Gen.18:22-32 -- Better than God (pleads with God not to destroy everyone in Sodom)

<p>Gen.20:2 Does the same "she's my sister" lie. (God closes all the wombs in the king's house.)

<p>Gen.21:10 Abandon's (with God's approval) his first son, Ishmael. 

<p>Gen.21:24 Swear's an oath.

<p>Gen.22:2-13 Shows his love for God by his willingness to murder his son, Isaac.

<p>Gen.24:2 Makes his servant swear while putting his hand "under his thigh" (hold his testicles in his hand) that he 
wouldn't not marry any Canaanite women.
