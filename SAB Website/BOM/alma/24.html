"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",

"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.   Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</span>--<a href='30.html#22'>Alma 30:22</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",

"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",

"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",
"<span class='i'>These dissenters ... became ... more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='47.html#36'>Alma 47:36</a>",

"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",

Amulonites and the Lamanites who were in the land of Amulon, and also in the land of Helam, and who were in the land 
of Jerusalem, and in fine, in all the land round about, who had not been converted and had not taken upon them the name 
of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, were stirred up by the Amalekites and by the Amulonites to anger against their brethren. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a> (24:1, 17, 20, 25, 26)
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>24:2</b>   And their hatred became <span class="a">exceedingly</span> sore against them, even insomuch that they 
began to rebel against their king, insomuch that they would not that he should be their king; therefore, they took up 
arms against the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>24:3</b>   <span class="a">Now the king conferred the kingdom upon his son, and he called his name 
Anti-Nephi-Lehi.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1">The king named his son "Anti-Nephi-Lehi."</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>24:4</b>   And the king died in that selfsame year that the Lamanites began to make preparations for war against 
the people of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>24:5</b>   Now when Ammon and his brethren and all those who had come up with him saw the preparations of the 
Lamanites to destroy their brethren, they came forth to the land of Midian, and there Ammon met all his brethren; 
and from thence they came to the land of Ishmael that they might hold a council with Lamoni and also with his brother 
Anti-Nephi-Lehi, what they should do to defend themselves against the Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>24:6</b>   Now there was not one soul among all the people who had been converted unto the Lord that would take 
up arms against their brethren; nay, they would not even make any preparations for war; yea, and also their king 
commanded them that they should not. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>24:7</b>   Now, these are the words which he said unto the people concerning the matter: I thank my God, my 
beloved people, that our great God has in goodness sent these our brethren, the Nephites, unto us to preach unto us, 
and to convince us of the traditions of our wicked fathers. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>24:8</b>   And behold, I thank my great God that he has given us a portion of his Spirit to soften our hearts, that 
we have opened a correspondence with these brethren, the Nephites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>24:9</b>   And behold, I also thank my God, that by opening this correspondence we have been convinced of our 
sins, and of the many murders which we have committed. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>24:10</b>   And I also thank my God, yea, my great God, that he hath granted unto us that we might repent of these 
things, and also that he hath forgiven us of those our many sins and murders which we have committed, and taken away the 
guilt from our hearts, through the merits of his Son. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>24:11</b>   And now behold, my brethren, since it has been all that we could do, (as we were the most lost of all 
mankind) to repent of all our sins and the many murders which we have committed, and to get God to take them away from 
our hearts, for it was all we could do to repent sufficiently before God that he would take away our stain --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>24:12</b>   Now, my best beloved brethren, since God hath taken away our stains, and our swords have become bright, 
then let us stain our swords no more with the blood of our brethren. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>24:13</b>   Behold, I say unto you, Nay, let us retain our swords that they be not stained with the blood of 
our brethren; for perhaps, if we should stain our swords again they can no more be washed bright through the blood 
of the Son of our great God, which shall be shed for the atonement of our sins. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>24:14</b>   And the great God has had mercy on us, and made these things known unto us that we might not perish; 
yea, and he has made these things known unto us beforehand, because he loveth our souls as well as he loveth our 
children; therefore, in his mercy he doth visit us by his angels, that the plan of salvation might be made known unto 
us as well as unto future generations. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>24:15</b>   Oh, how merciful is our God!  And now behold, since it has been as much as we could do to get 
our stains taken away from us, and our swords are made bright, let us hide them away that they may be kept bright, 
as a testimony to our God at the last day, or at the day that we shall be brought to stand before him to be judged, 
that we have not stained our swords in the blood of our brethren since he imparted his word unto us and has made us 
clean thereby. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>24:16</b>   And now, my brethren, if our brethren seek to destroy us, behold, we will hide away our swords, yea, 
even we will bury them deep in the earth, that they may be kept bright, as a testimony that we have never used them, 
at the last day; and if our brethren destroy us, behold, we shall go to our God and shall be saved. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>24:17</b>   <span class="a">And now it came to pass</span> that when the king had made an end of these sayings, and all the people were 
assembled together, they took their swords, and all the weapons which were used for the shedding of man's blood, and 
they did bury them up deep in the earth. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>24:18</b>   And this they did, it being in their view a testimony to God, and also to men, that they never 
would use weapons again for the shedding of man's blood; and this they did, vouching and covenanting with God, 
that rather than shed the blood of their brethren they would give up their own lives; and rather than take away 
from a brother they would give unto him; and rather than spend their days in idleness they would labor abundantly 
with their hands. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>24:19</b>   And thus we see that, when these Lamanites were brought to believe and to know the truth, they were 
firm, and would suffer even unto death rather than commit sin; and thus we see that they buried their weapons of 
peace, or they buried the weapons of war, for peace. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>24:20</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that their brethren, the Lamanites, made preparations for 
war, and came up to the land of Nephi for the purpose of destroying the king, and to place another in his stead, and 
also of destroying the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi out of the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>24:21</b>   Now when the people saw that they were coming against them they went out to meet them, and prostrated 
themselves before them to the earth, and began to call on the name of the Lord; and thus they were in this attitude 
when the Lamanites began to fall upon them, and began to slay them with the sword. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>24:22</b>   And thus without meeting any resistance, they did slay a thousand and five of them; and we know 
that they are blessed, for they have gone to dwell with their God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>24:23</b>   Now when the Lamanites 
saw that their brethren would not flee from the sword, neither would they turn aside to the right hand or to the left, 
but that they would lie down and perish, and praised God even in the very act of perishing under the 
sword --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>24:24</b>   Now when the Lamanites saw this they did forbear from slaying them; and there were many whose hearts 
had swollen in them for those of their brethren who had fallen under the sword, for they repented of the things which 
they had done. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>24:25</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they threw down their weapons of war, and they would 
not take them again, for they were stung for the murders which they had committed; and they came down even as their 
brethren, relying upon the mercies of those whose arms were lifted to slay them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>24:26</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the people of God were joined that day by more than 
the number who had been slain; and those who had been slain were righteous people, therefore we have no reason to doubt 
but what they were saved. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>24:27</b>   And there was not a wicked man slain among them; but there were more than a thousand brought to the 
knowledge of the truth; thus we see that the Lord worketh in many ways to the salvation of his people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>24:28</b>   Now the greatest number of those of the Lamanites who slew so many of their brethren were Amalekites 
and Amulonites, the greatest number of whom were after the order of the Nehors. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>24:29</b>   Now, among those who joined the people of the Lord, there were none who were Amalekites or Amulonites, 
or who were of the order of Nehor, but they were actual descendants of Laman and Lemuel. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>24:30</b>   And thus we can plainly discern, that after a people have been once enlightened by the Spirit of God, 
and have had great knowledge of things pertaining to righteousness, and then have fallen away into sin and 
transgression, they become more hardened, and thus their state becomes worse than though they had never known 
these things. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
