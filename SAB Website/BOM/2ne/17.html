<a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a> (17:1, 21, 22, 23)

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif"  > (17:1-25) More Isaiah (<a href="../../is/7.html">Chapter 7</a>)

<p>(17:1) And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of
    Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of
    Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but
    could not prevail against it. <br>
    
    (17:2) And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with
    Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees
    of the wood are moved with the wind.<br>
    
    (17:3) Then said the LORD unto
    Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shearjashub thy son, at the
    end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field;<br>

    (17:4) And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two
    tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria,
    and of the son of Remaliah.<br>
    
    (17:5) Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel
    against thee, saying,<br>
    
    (17:6) Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein
    for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal:

    <br>(17:7) Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.
    
    <br>(17:8) For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and
    within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a
    people.

    <br>(17:9) And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's
    son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.
    
    <br>(17:10) Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying, 

    <br>(17:11) Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the
    height above.
    
    <p>(17:12) But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.

    <p>(17:13) And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to
    weary men, but will ye weary my God also? 
    
    <p>(17:14) Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall
    conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.

    <p>(17:15) Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and
    choose the good.
    
    <p>(17:16) For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good,
    the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.

    <p>(17:17) The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's
    house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from
    Judah; even the king of Assyria.<br>
    
    <p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (17:18) "The Lord shall hiss for the fly ... and for the bee."
    
    <p>(17:18) And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall hiss for the fly that is
    in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of
    Assyria.<br>

    (17:19) And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys,
    and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes.
    
    <p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" >
<img src="../../images/lang1.gif" >
<img src="../../images/sex1.gif" > (17:20) "The Lord [will shave with a razor ... the head and hair of the feet," where
"hair" and "feet" are biblical euphemisms for pubic hair and male sexual organs, respectively.
    
    <p>(17:20) In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the
    river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume
    the beard.<br>
    
    (17:21) And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young
    cow, and two sheep;<br>
    
    (17:22) And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give
    he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left
    in the land. <br>

    (17:23) And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall be, where
    there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, it shall even be for
    briers and thorns.<br>
    
    (17:24) With arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all the land
    shall become briers and thorns.<br>

    (17:25) And on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there shall not
    come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the sending
    forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle.

<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>17:1</b> <span class="plag">And</span> <span class="a">It came to pass</span>
  <span class="plag">in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, 
the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up 
toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>17:2</b> <span class="plag">And it was told the house of David, saying: Syria is confederate with Ephraim.  And his heart was moved, 
and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>17:3</b> <span class="plag">Then said the Lord unto Isaiah: Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of 
the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field; </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>17:4</b> <span class="plag">And say unto him: Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be faint-hearted for the two tails of 
these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>17:5</b> <span class="plag">Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying:
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>17:6</b> <span class="plag">Let us go up against Judah and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the 
midst of it, yea, the son of Tabeal. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>17:7</b><span class="plag">   Thus saith the Lord God: It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>17:8</b> <span class="plag">For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus, Rezin; and within three score and five 
years shall Ephraim be broken that it be not a people. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>17:9</b> <span class="plag">And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son.  If ye will not believe 
surely ye shall not be established. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>17:10</b> <span class="plag">Moreover, the Lord spake again unto Ahaz, saying:</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>17:11</b> <span class="plag">Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God; ask it either in the depths, or in the heights above.
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>17:12</b> <span class="plag">But Ahaz said: I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord.
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>17:13</b> <span class="plag">And he said: Hear ye now, O house of David; is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye 
weary my God also? </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>17:14</b> <span class="plag">Therefore, the Lord himself shall give you a sign -- Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and shall 
bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>17:15</b> <span class="plag">Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil and to choose the good.
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>17:16</b> <span class="plag">For before the child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest 
shall be forsaken of both her kings. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>17:17</b> <span class="plag">The Lord shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days that have not 
come from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah, the king of Assyria. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>17:18</b> <span class="plag">And</span> <span class="a">it shall come to pass</span>
  <span class="plag">in that day that</span> <span class="a">the Lord shall hiss 
for the fly</span> <span class="plag">that is in the uttermost part of Egypt,
  </span> <span class="a">and for the bee</span> <span class="plag">that is in the land of Assyria.
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>17:19</b> <span class="plag">And they shall come, and shall rest 
all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon 
all bushes. </span>

the feet</span>; <span class="plag">and it shall also consume the beard. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>17:21</b> <span class="plag">And </span> <span class="a">it shall come to pass</span>
  <span class="plag">in that day, 
a man shall nourish a young cow and two sheep; </span>

  <span class="plag">for the abundance of milk they shall give he shall eat butter; for butter

  <span class="plag">in that day, every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a
