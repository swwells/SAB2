<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>21:1</b>   Now when Ammon and his brethren separated themselves in the borders of the land of the Lamanites, behold 
Aaron took his journey towards the land which was called by the Lamanites, Jerusalem, calling it after the land of their 
fathers' nativity; and it was away joining the borders of Mormon. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>21:2</b>   Now the Lamanites and the Amalekites and the people of Amulon had built a great city, which was called 
Jerusalem. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>21:3</b>   Now the Lamanites of themselves were sufficiently hardened, but the Amalekites and the Amulonites 
were still harder; therefore they did cause the Lamanites that they should harden their hearts, that they should wax 
strong in wickedness and their abominations. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>21:4</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Aaron came to the city of Jerusalem, and first began 
to preach to the Amalekites.  And he began to preach to them in their synagogues, for they had built synagogues after 
the order of the Nehors; for many of the Amalekites and the Amulonites were after the order of the Nehors <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>21:5</b>   Therefore, as Aaron entered into one of their synagogues to preach unto the people, and as he was 
speaking unto them, behold there arose an Amalekite and began to contend with him, saying: What is that thou hast 
testified?  Hast thou seen an angel?  Why do not angels appear unto us?  Behold are not this people as good as 
thy people? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>21:6</b>   Thou also sayest, <span class="c">except we repent we shall perish.</span>  How knowest thou the thought and intent of our 
hearts?  How knowest thou that we have cause to repent?  How knowest thou that we are not a righteous people?  Behold, 
we have built sanctuaries, and we do assemble ourselves together to worship God.  We do believe that God will save all 
men. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>21:7</b>   Now Aaron said unto him: Believest thou that the Son of God shall come to redeem mankind from their 
sins? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>21:8</b>   And the man said unto him: We do not believe that thou knowest any such thing.  We do not believe in 
these foolish traditions.   We do not believe that thou knowest of things to come, neither do we believe that thy 
fathers and also that our fathers did know concerning the things which they spake, of that which is to come. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>21:9</b>   Now Aaron began to open the scriptures unto them concerning the coming of Christ, and also concerning 
the resurrection of the dead, and that there could be no redemption for mankind save it were through the death and 
sufferings of Christ, and the atonement of his blood. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>21:10</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> as he began to expound these things unto them they were 
angry with him, and began to mock him; and they would not hear the words which he spake. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>21:11</b>   Therefore, when he saw that they would not hear his words, he departed out of their synagogue, and 
came over to a village which was called Ani-Anti, and there he found Muloki preaching the word unto them; and also 
Ammah and his brethren.  And they contended with many about the word. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>21:12</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they saw that the people would harden their hearts, 
therefore they departed and came over into the land of Middoni.  And they did preach the word unto many, and few 
believed on the words which they taught. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>21:13</b>   Nevertheless, Aaron and a certain number of his brethren were taken and cast into prison, and 
the remainder of them fled out of the land of Middoni unto the regions round about. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>21:14</b>   And those who were cast into prison suffered many things, and they were delivered by the hand of 
Lamoni and Ammon, and they were fed and clothed. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>21:15</b>   And they went forth again to declare the word, and thus they were delivered for the first time out of 
prison; and thus they had suffered. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>21:16</b>   And they went forth whithersoever they were led by the Spirit of the Lord, preaching the word of 
God in every synagogue of the Amalekites, or in every assembly of the Lamanites where they could be admitted. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>21:17</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Lord began to bless them, insomuch that they 
brought many to the knowledge of the truth; yea, they did convince many of their sins, and of the traditions of their 
fathers, which were not correct. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>21:18</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Ammon and Lamoni returned from the land of Middoni to 
the land of Ishmael, which was the land of their inheritance. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>21:19</b>   And king Lamoni would not suffer that Ammon should serve him, or be his servant. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>21:20</b>   But he caused that there should be synagogues built in the land of Ishmael; and he caused that his 
people, or the people who were under his reign, should assemble themselves together. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>21:21</b>   And he did rejoice over them, and he did teach them many things.  And he did also declare unto them 
that they were a people who were under him, and that <span class="g">they were a free people</span>, that they were free from the oppressions 
of the king, his father; for that his father had granted unto him that he might reign over the people who were in the 
land of Ishmael, and in all the land round about. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Lamoni declares (and the Book of Mormon seems to approve) that the people should be free.

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>21:22</b>   And he also declared unto them that they might have <span class="g">the liberty of worshiping the Lord their God 
according to their desires</span>, in whatsoever place they were in, if it were in the land which was under the reign of 
king Lamoni. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>21:23</b>   And Ammon did preach unto the people of king Lamoni; <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that 
he did teach them all things concerning things pertaining to righteousness.  And he did exhort them daily, with all 
diligence; and they gave heed unto his word, and they were zealous for keeping the commandments of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
