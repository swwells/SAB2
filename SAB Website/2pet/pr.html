<p><li>"Where is the promise of his coming?"<br>
The author of 2 Peter is aware of the failed expectations of
early believers. He knows that Jesus, who was to come soon, didn't come at all.
Many have begun to ask, &quot;Where is the promise of his coming?&quot; He tries
to cover for Jesus by claiming that &quot;one day with the Lord is as a thousand
years.&quot; <a href="3.html#4">3:4</a>
