<h2 align="center">People of Color</h2>
<ul>

<li><a href="../2ne/5.html#21">2 Nephi 5:21</a> "And he [God] had caused the cursing to come upon them ... wherefore, as they 
were white, and exceedingly fair and delightsome, that they might not be enticing unto my people the Lord God did cause a skin 
of blackness to come upon them."

<p><li><a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/moses/7#22">Moses 7:22</a> "And Enoch also beheld the residue of the people which were the sons of
Adam; and they were a mixture of all the seed of Adam save it was the seed of Cain, for<i> the seed of Cain were black</i>, and had 
not place among them." 

<p><li><a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/abr/1#21">Abraham 1:21-26</a> "Now this king of Egypt was a descendant from the loins of Ham, and was a partaker of the 
blood of the Canaanites by birth. From this descent sprang all the Egyptians, and thus the blood of the Canaanites was preserved 
in the land. The land of Egypt being first discovered by a woman, who was the daughter of Ham, and the daughter of Egyptus, which 
in the Chaldean signifies Egypt, which signifies that which is forbidden; When this woman discovered the land it was under 
water, who afterward settled her sons in it; and thus, <i>from Ham, sprang that race which preserved the curse in the land</i>. Now the 
first government of Egypt was established by Pharaoh, the eldest son of Egyptus, the daughter of Ham, and it was after the 
manner of the government of Ham, which was patriarchal. Pharaoh, being a righteous man, established his kingdom and judged his 
people wisely and justly all his days, seeking earnestly to imitate that established by the fathers in the first generations, 
in the days of the first patriarchal reign, even in the reign of Adam, and also of Noah, his father, who blessed him with the 
blessing of the earth, and with the blessings of wisdom, but <i>cursed him as pertaining to the Priesthood</i>.

</ul>

(The Books of Moses and Abraham are from "The Pearl of Great Price", which, although not in the Book of Mormon, is a part of Mormon scripture.)
