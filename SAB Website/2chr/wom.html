    <p><li>God tells Solomon that he likes him so darned much (he likes murderers and polygamists) that 
    he's going to make him the richest man who has ever lived. <a href="1.html#11">1:11-12</a>

<p><li>Solomon's Egyptian wife can't be around holy places. Is that because she is a woman or because she is an Egyptian, or 
both? <a href="8.html#11">8:11</a>

<p><li>Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines." <a href="11.html#21">11:21a</a>

<p><li>"He took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines."  <a href="11.html#21">11:21b</a>

<p><li>"Rehoboam ... dealt wisely ... and desired many wives." <a href="11.html#22">11:22-23</a>

<p><li>"But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives." Apparently, in the eyes of God, a man's status is
determined by the number of wives that he possesses.  <a href="13.html#21">13:21</a>

<p><li>"Jehoiada took for him two wives" -- without comment, complaint, or criticism from the bible.
