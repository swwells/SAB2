<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>10:29</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Lib did live many years, and begat sons and daughters; and he also begat Hearthom. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>10:30</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Hearthom reigned in the stead of his father.  And when Hearthom had 
reigned twenty and four years, behold, the kingdom was taken away from him.  And he served many years in captivity, 
yea, even all the remainder of his days. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>10:31</b>   And he begat Heth, and Heth lived in captivity all his days.   And Heth begat Aaron, and Aaron dwelt in 
captivity all his days; and he begat Amnigaddah, and Amnigaddah also dwelt in captivity all his days; and he begat 
Coriantum, and Coriantum dwelt in captivity all his days; and he begat Com. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

kingdom forty and two years; and he went to battle against the king, Amgid, and they fought for the space of many years, 
during which time Com gained power over Amgid, and obtained power over the remainder of the kingdom. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

administered oaths after the manner of the ancients, and sought again to destroy the kingdom. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
