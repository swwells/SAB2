<p><li>The hand of the Lord takes Ezekiel on a trip to Israel and sets him on a mountain top, where a brass man measures a building with a rod. 
(I'd skip this chapter unless you are interested in the dimensions of the brass man's imaginary building.) <a href="40.html#1">40:1-49</a>
 
<p><li>The brass man provides more exciting measurements of Ezekiel's imaginary temple. (I'd skip it, if I were you.) <a href="41.html#1">41:1-22</a>

<p><li>The brass man takes even more measurements of Ezekiel's imaginary buildings. <a href="42.html#2">42:2-20</a>

<p><li>But the dimension break is over. God himself (in all this glory) takes over the measurements from the bronze man, telling us all about the fashion, 
form, law, and the dimensions of the house. <a href="43.html#10">43:10-17</a>

<p><li>More of God's holy dimensions <a href="45.html#1">45:1-6</a>

<p><li>In the exciting conclusion of the book of Ezekiel, we learn who is going to get what and what the city is 
    going to be named. I'm not going to spoil it for you, though. You have to read it yourself. <a href="48.html#8">48:8-35</a>
