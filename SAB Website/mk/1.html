which shall prepare thy way before thee."</i><br>
Mark claims that John the Baptist fulfilled the prophecy given in Malachi 
(<a href="../mal/3.html#1">3:1</a>, <a href="../mal/4.html#1">4:1, 5</a>). But the Malachi prophecy says that God 
will send Elijah before "the great and dreadful day of the LORD" in which the world will be consumed by fire. John the 
Baptist flatly denied that he was Elijah (Elias) in <a href="../jn/1.html#21">John 1:21</a> and the earth was not destroyed after 
John's appearance.
  
<p>The phrase "as it is written in the prophets" is not found in the oldest and best Greek manuscripts which say, rather,
 "as it is written in Isaiah." Scribes made the change to correct the mistake of attributing the quotation to Isaiah, since 
 the first part of the quote (v.2) is not from Isaiah, but from <a href="../ex/23.html#20">Ex.23:20</a> and 
 <a href="../mal/3.html#1">Mal.3:1</a>.<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup>

    <img src="../images/interp.gif" > (1:41) <i>"Jesus, moved with compassion"</i><br>
    Some manuscripts say that Jesus was moved with anger, not compassion. Bart Ehrman in 
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060738170/skepticsannotate">Misquoting Jesus</a> (p.133-138) argues that 
    the original text probably said that Jesus reacted with wrath rather than compassion, and was later changed by scribes to 
    make the verse less problematic.

  And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him,
    and he was cleansed.

  And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;

  And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew
    thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses
    commanded, for a testimony unto them.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the
    matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but
    was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.
