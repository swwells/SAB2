God showed his approval of

<p><li>"A certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which
    shall devour the adversaries."<br> God will soon destroy non-believers in a fiery hell. <a href="10.html#27">10:27</a>

<p><li>Those who disobeyed the Old Testament law were killed without mercy. It will be much worse for those who displease
