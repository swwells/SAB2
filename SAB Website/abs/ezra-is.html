<p><li> In verse 11, the total number of items listed in the previous two verses
 is said to be 5400. The actual total is 2499. <a href="../ezra/1.html#9">1:9-11</a>
 
<p><li>God's magical Urim and Thummim <a href="../ezra/2.html#63">2:63</a>

<p><li>"The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand tree hundred and threescore
[42,360]." Yet if we count up all of the numbers in the list just given in
Ezra 2:3-62 we obtain a different number: 29,818. <a href="../ezra/2.html#65">2:65</a>

<p><li>When Ezra hears of the intermarriages, he tears up his clothes, plucks out his hair and beard, and sits 
down astonished. <a href="../ezra/9.html#3">9:3</a>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="33886" endspan --><p><b><a href="../neh/abs_list.html">Nehemiah</a></b>

<p><li>"Then I consulted with myself." <a href="../neh/5.html#7">5:7</a>

<p><li>Nehemiah gets so upset that he shakes his lap.  <a href="../neh/5.html#13">5:13</a>

<p><li>God's magical Urim and Thummim <a href="../neh/7.html#65">7:65</a>

<p><li> Here we are told that the whole congregation
totaled 42,360. But if we just total up the numbers given in Neh.7:8-62 we come
up with only 31,089. <a href="../neh/7.html#66">7:66</a>

<p><li>The Israelites clothing didn't wear out while wandering around in the desert for 40 years. 
    (God made the childrens' shoes grow with their feet so they wouldn't need new ones!) <a href="../neh/9.html#21">9:21</a>
    
    <p><li>Nehemiah threw all of Tobiah's stuff out of the room. <a href="../neh/13.html#8">13:8</a>

<p><li>Nehemiah rebukes the men for marrying "strange wives." To punish them he "contended with them, and
cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair."  <a href="../neh/13.html#25">13:25-27</a>

<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../est/abs.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p><li>"Ahasuerus ... made a feast ... even an hundred and fourscore days."</i><br>
    Woohoo! A 180 day party! <a href="../est/1.html#2">1:2-4</a>

<p><li>Because Mordecai (who was a Jew) refused to bow to Haman, Haman decides to kill every Jew in the Persian Empire, offering to pay 
10,000 talents of silver (~300,000 kg) to get the job done. <a href="../est/3.html#2">3:2-9</a>

<p><li>The king sends out a decree to all the provinces declaring a kingdom-wide Kill-the-Jews day. It was to take place on the 13th 
day of the 12th month. <a href="../est/3.html#13">3:13</a>

<p><li>"Mordecai rent his clothes." <a href="../est/4.html#1">4:1</a>

<p><li>Haman's wife and friends tell Haman to have a 25 meter high gallows be made to hang Mordecai on. So they did that in a single day.  
<a href="../est/5.html#14">5:14</a>

<p><li>The king couldn't sleep so he asked someone to read to him the book of Chronicles. 
    That ought to do it! <a href="../1chr/1.html">1 Chornicles</a> is probably the most boring book ever written. No one can read 
    it without falling asleep. <a href="../est/6.html#1">6:1</a>
    
<p><li>The king had completely forgotten that he had ordered the genocide of the Jews back in <a href="../est/3.html#13">chapter 3</a>. 
<a href="../est/7.html#5">7:5</a>

<p><li>At Esther's request, the king orders a preemptive strike on all 127 provinces from Egypt to Ethiopia. Everyone who planned 
    to kill Jews shall be killed by Jews, along with their wives and children. And all this killing is to take place on a single day. <br>
    (How are the Jews to figure out who planned to kill them and who didn't? Were they supposed to just kill them all and let God sort it out? 
    And why did they need to kill the women and children?)  <a href="../est/8.html#9">8:9-13</a>
    
<p><li>On the day when all Jew-haters (and their families) were killed by Jews, "the Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour 
... a feast and a good day." <a href="../est/8.html#16">8:16-17</a>
    

    

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="37744" endspan --><p><b><a href="../job/abs_list.html">Job</a></b>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../job/abs.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p><li>Job was a perfect man, the richest in all the east. He had 7 sons and 3 daughters that liked to party. The sons often 
invited their sister over to party with them. <a href="../job/1.html#1">1:1-4</a>

<p><li>"There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man  was perfect."<br>
    Nobody's perfect. Well, except for Job (and <a href="../gen/6.html#9">Noah</a>). <a href="../job/1.html#1">1:1</a>
    
<p><li>God makes a bet with his son, Satan. God tells Satan to do nasty things to Job to see if he can get him to curse God to his face. 
<a href="../job/1.html#6">1:6-12</a>

<p><li>The sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them."  <br>
Satan is the son of God -- the only one that God ever seems to talk to. <a href="../job/1.html#6">1:6</a>, <a href="../job/2.html#1">2:1</a>
    
<p><li>God asks where Satan has been lately (apparently God didn't know), and Satan answered
saying, "From walking to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down on it." This verse inspired 
Mark Twain's 
<A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060921056/skepticsannotate/104-1593784-1808756">Letters 
From the Earth.</A>. <a href="../job/1.html#7">1:7</a>, <a href="../job/2.html#2">2:2</a>

<p><li>God gives Satan power over all that Job possesses. <a href="../job/1.html#12">1:12</a>

<p><li>God kills (or allows Satan to kill) Job's children, but Job doesn't "foolishly" blame 
God. Since God was responsible, why would it be foolish to blame God? <a href="../job/1.html#20">1:20-22</a>

<p><li>God and Satan play a little game with Job. God allows Satan to torment Job, just to see how he will react. 
<a href="../job/2.html#3">2:3-7</a>

<p><li>"So went Satan forth from
    the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his
    crown." <a href="../job/2.html#7">2:7</a>
    
    <p><li>"They rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads." <a href="../job/2.html#12">2:12</a>
    
<p><li>"Is there any taste in the white of an egg?" <a href="../job/6.html#6">6:6</a>

<p><li>Does God pervert Justice?  Well, if you believe the Bible he sure as hell does! <a href="../job/8.html#3">8:3</a>

<p><li>Job says &quot;my breath is strange to my wife.&quot; Mine too. <a href="../job/19.html#17">19:17</a>

<p><li>"<I>His</I> breasts are full of milk." <a href="../job/21.html#24">21:24</a>

<p><li>  When things were going well for Job he washed his steps with butter and rocks poured out rivers of oil. <a href="../job/29.html#6">29:6</a>

<p><li>  Job's &quot;bowels boiled.&quot; Now that doesn't sound pleasant. <a href="../job/30.html#27">30:27</a>

<p><li>  Job is the brother of dragons. <a href="../job/30.html#29">30:29</a>

<p><li>"For God speaketh in a dream ... He openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction." <a href="../job/33.html#14">33:14-16</a>
  
<p><li>"By the breath of God frost is given." <a href="../job/37.html#10">37:10</a>

<p><li>"Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind." <a href="../job/38.html#1">38:1</a>

<p><li>The morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy." <a href="../job/38.html#7">38:7</a>

<p><li>God could (if he wanted to) pick up the earth by its ends and shake all the wicked people off of it. <a href="../job/38.html#13">38:13</a>

<p><li>God has snow and hail stored up to use later in time of trouble and war.  <a href="../job/38.html#22">38:22</a>

<p><li>"Out of whose womb came the ice?"
Gosh, I don't know. Was it Glinda, the Good Witch of the North? <a href="../job/38.html#29">38:29</a>
  
<p><li>&quot;Who can stay the bottles of heaven?&quot; Gosh, I don't know. I didn't even know there <I>were</I> any bottles in heaven. 
<a href="../job/38.html#37">38:37</a>

<p><li>"Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee?" The unicorn referred to here is probably not the single-horned mythical creature, but rather 
a wild ox that was mistranslated in the KJV. <a href="../job/39.html#9">39:9-10</a>

<p><li>Bible believers have identified the behemoth as 
a hippopotamus, dinosaur, wildebeest, or crocodile. But my favorite is the way 
these verses are translated by Stephen Mitchell: &quot;Look now: the Beast that I 
made: he eats grass like a bull. Look: the power in his thighs, the pulsing 
sinews of his belly. His penis stiffens like a pine; his testicles bulge with 
vigor.&quot; <a href="../job/40.html#15">40:15-16</a>

<p><li>"Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord?" <a href="../job/41.html#1">41:1</a>

<p><li> After God and Satan get done tormenting Job, God gave Job even more stuff than he had before, including 
children. God gave Job another set of 10 kids, with even prettier daughters! <a href="../job/42.html#13">42:13-15</a>

<p><li>Job lived to be 140 years old. <a href="../job/42.html#16">42:16</a>

search your kidneys</a> <a href="../ps/7.html#9">7:9</a>

<p><li>God made the heavens with his fingers.  <a href="../ps/8.html#3">8:3</a>

<p><li>God's eyelids. <a href="../ps/11.html#4">11:4</a>

<p><li>Atheists are fools who never do anything good. <a href="../ps/14.html#1">14:1</a>, <a href="../ps/53.html#1">53:1</a>

<p><li>"They are all together become filthy: there is none that doth good, no, not one."
Everyone is filthy and no one has ever done anything good. <a href="../ps/14.html#3">14:3</a>

<p><li>"My reins also instruct me in the night seasons."<br>
The Psalmist's kidneys (reins) instruct him at night. <a href="../ps/16.html#7">16:7</a>

<p><li>"At thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore." <a href="../ps/16.html#11">16:11</a>

<p><li>God's lips <a href="../ps/17.html#4">17:4</a>

<p><li> The earth shakes whenever God really gets mad.  <a href="../ps/18.html#7">18:7</a>

<p><li>Smoke comes out of God's nose and fire comes out of his mouth. <a href="../ps/18.html#8">18:8</a>

<p><li>God curved the heavens and came down to earth with darkness under his feet.  <a href="../ps/18.html#9">18:9</a>

<p><li>God rides upon cherubs and flies through the sky.  <a href="../ps/18.html#10">18:10</a>

<p><li> &quot;The foundations of the world were
discovered ... at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.&quot; (The earth is set on firm foundations 
and does not move -- unless God blows his nose.) <a href="../ps/18.html#15">18:15</a>

<p><li>"Try my reins and my heart."</i><br>

<p><li>"The Lord is upon many waters. ... The Lord sitteth upon the flood." <a href="../ps/29.html#3">29:3, 10</a>

<p><li>God's voice is so loud it can break the cedars of Lebanon.  <a href="../ps/29.html#5">29:5</a>

<p><li>"He maketh them also to skip ... like a young unicorn." <a href="../ps/29.html#6">29:6</a>

<p><li>Those who fear God never starve. <a href="../ps/33.html#19">33:19</a>

<P><li> Those "that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing." (Those who are poor or hungry 
just aren't seeking God enough.) <a href="../ps/34.html#10">34:10</a>

<p><li>"Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all."<br>
    Nothing bad ever happens to righteous folks. <a href="../ps/34.html#19">34:19</a>

<p><li>Those who trust in God and do good, will never be hungry. (Those who starve to death 
didn't trust him or did bad things.) <a href="../ps/37.html#3">37:3</a>

<p><li>If you delight yourself in God, he'll give you whatever you want. <a href="../ps/37.html#4">37:4</a>

<p><li>The meek shall inherit the earth." Will they really? In nature they inherit nothing, but die painful deaths from
disease, starvation, and predation.  <a href="../ps/37.html#11">37:11</a>

<p><li>The author of this psalm allegedly is David. If so, then it's 
not surprising that his "loins" would be "filled with a loathsome disease." After all, his promiscuity 
was legendary, and he probably didn't practice safe sex.  <a href="../ps/38.html#5">38:5, 7</a>

<p><li>God's clothes smell like myrrh, aloes, and cassia. <a href="../ps/45.html#8">45:8</a>

<p><li>Wicked people are wicked from birth -- God made them that way. They tell lies immediately after birth
(before they can even talk!).  <a href="../ps/58.html#3">58:3</a>

<p><li>According to the psalmist, snails melt. But they don't, of course, they simply leave a slimy trail as they move
along.  <a href="../ps/58.html#8">58:8</a>

<p><li>They [the heathen] make a noise like a dog .... Behold, they belch out with their mouths." These are good
reasons for God to kill them.  <a href="../ps/59.html#6">59:6-7, 14</a>

<p><li>"The God of mercy" will let the psalmist see his enemies tormented. <a href="../ps/59.html#10">59:10</a>

<p><li>God divides the world into those countries that he likes and those that he doesn't. 
Those he doesn't like he calls names (like "washpot") and says that he will throw his shoe at them. <a href="../ps/60.html#7">60:7-8</a>

<p><li>"The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: even
    Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God." <a href="../ps/68.html#8">68:8</a>
    
<p><li>    God has 20,000 chariots and thousands of angels. "The Lord is among them."
 <a href="../ps/68.html#17">68:17</a>    

<p><li>The psalmist prays that his enemies be tormented and blinded by God. He asks God to "make their loins
continually to shake."  <a href="../ps/69.html#23">69:23-28</a>

<p><li> God rides on the heavens of heavens, he sends out his mighty voice, his strength is in the clouds, 
    and he is terrible in his holy places.  <a href="../ps/68.html#33">68:33-35</a>

<p><li>"I was pricked in my reins."<br>
("Reins" means kidneys in the Bible.) <a href="../ps/73.html#21">73:21</a>

<p><li>God is so strong that he can break the head of dragons and of leviathan. 
<a href="../ps/74.html#13">74:13-14</a>

<p><li>"The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid." <a href="../ps/77.html#16">77:16</a>

<p><li>"The LORD heard this" (he had his hearing aid on) and became angry, and burned people  
"because they believed not in God." <a href="../ps/78.html#21">78:21-22</a>

<p><li>Man did eat angels' food." <a href="../ps/78.html#25">78:25</a>

<p><li>"He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea."<br>
    See <a href="../num/11.html#20">Numbers 11:20-32</a>, where God sends quails to feed the Israelites until it literally came out their 
    noses. <a href="../ps/78.html#27">78:27</a>

<p><li>"And he [God] smote his enemies in the hinder parts." (He kicked their ass.)  <a href="../ps/78.html#66">78:66</a>

<p><li>&quot;I have said, Ye are gods.&quot; Jesus quotes this verse in <A
href="../jn/10.html#34">John 10:34</A> to get out of a tough spot. (He was
claiming to be God for which the Jews accused him of blasphemy.) <a href="../ps/82.html#6">82:6</a>

<p><li>"The LORD God is a sun." <a href="../ps/84.html#11">84:11</a>

<p><li>"I will make mention of Rahab"<br>
    Rahab is a sea-demon or dragon from ancient Jewish folklore. <a href="../ps/87.html#4">87:4</a>

<p><li>"Thou hast broken Rahab [the sea monster] in pieces." <a href="../ps/89.html#10">89:10</a>

<p><li>The psalmist has a horn that he'd like God to erect -- "like the horn of a unicorn." 
<a href="../ps/92.html#10">92:10</a>

<p><li>"They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing."
Being fat is is sure sign of righteousness. (Wicked people are skinny and hungry.) <a href="../ps/92.html#12">92:12-14</a>

<p><li>"A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about." <a href="../ps/97.html#3">97:3</a>

<p><li>"The Lord ... who healeth all thy diseases." God heals all diseases. Medical science is 
unnecessary. <a href="../ps/103.html#2">103:2-3</a>

<p><li>"The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy."<br> 
Is this the same guy who demanded that peoples' heads be hung up before him to appease his fierce anger 
(<A href="../num/25.html#4">Numbers 25:4</A>), and who
ordered the slaughter of thousands of innocent men, women, children 
(<A href="../1sam/15.html#2">1 Samuel 15:2-3</A>)? <a href="../ps/103.html#8">103:8</a>

<p><li>"He smote ... their fig trees." (God hates figs) <a href="../ps/105.html#33">105:33</a>
 
 <p><li>"The waters stood above the mountains."<br>
Noah's flood covered the highest mountains, just like it says in <a href="../gen/7.html#20">Genesis 7:20</a>.   <a href="../ps/105.html#6">104:6-7</a>
 
 <p><li>God swears. <a href="../ps/110.html#4">110:4</a>

<p><li>"Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints." <a href="../ps/116.html#15">116:15</a> 

<p><li>Proud people have hearts that are "fat as grease."  <a href="../ps/119.html#69">119:69-70</a>

<p><li>"The LORD is thy keeper.... The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon 
by night." So believers don't have to bother with sunscreen. God will protect them from 
sunburn, and moonburn too. <a href="../ps/121.html#5">121:5-6</a>

<p><li>"Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee."<br>
Jews, Christians, and Muslims all love Jerusalem, and fight each other for the holy city, exclusively given to them by God. None of them prosper. 
<a href="../ps/122.html#6">122:6</a>

<p><li>"Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it."<br>
    God doesn't build houses or watch over cities; people do. <a href="../ps/127.html#1">127:1</a>
    
<p><li>"He giveth his beloved sleep."<br>
Don't bother getting up early and working hard. If God loves you, you can sleep in and let God 
take care you. <a href="../ps/127.html#2">127:2</a> 

<p><li>"To him that smote Egypt in their first born: for his mercy endures forever." 
<a href="../ps/136.html#10">136:10</a>

<p><li>God "overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea: for his mercy endureth for ever."
 <a href="../ps/136.html#15">136:15</a>
 
<p><li>God "smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for ever." <a href="../ps/136.html#17">136:17-18</a>
<p><li>God is in hell.  <a href="../ps/139.html#8">139:8</a>

<p><li>Even the dragons praise the Lord.  <a href="../ps/148.html#7">148:7</a>

    God makes the diligent fat. (Lazy people are skinny and poor.) <a href="../pr/13.html#4">13:4</a>

<p><li>"The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem ... I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem ... I am come to great 
estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me."<br>
The author of Ecclesiastes claims to be the wise, rich son of King David, which is to say, Solomon. He isn't. Ecclesiastes was written 
(forged) about six hundred years after Solomon died (if he ever lived, that is). <a href="../ec/1.html#1">1:1, 12, 16</a>

<p><li>"He hath made every thing beautiful."<br>
Everything is beautiful in its own way. Parasitic worms, cancer cells, bubonic plague. You just have to look at it from God's eyes.
<a href="../ec/3.html#11">3:11a</a>

<p><li>"No man can find out the work that God maketh."<br>
Science is impossible. We can learn nothing at all about the natural world. <a href="../ec/3.html#11">3:11b</a>

<p><li>"That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?"<br>
    Who can find out? We can by using science! The earth, ocean, solar system, galaxy, and universe -- nothing is too deep or far away for 
    science to discover and explore. <a href="../ec/7.html#24">7:24</a>

<p><li>"Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work
    that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet
    he shall not find it; yea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet
    shall he not be able to find it."<br>
    Oh, I think science has done a pretty good job of finding things out over the last four centuries or so. <a href="../ec/8.html#16">8:16</a>

<p><li>"Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days." <a href="../ec/11.html#1">11:1</a>

<p><li>"In the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be." <a href="../ec/11.html#3">11:3</a>

<p><li>"Instead of a sweet smell there shall be stink ... 
   instead of well set hair baldness ... and burning instead of beauty." <a href="../is/3.html#24">3:24</a>

<p><li>After God "washed away the filth" from the women and killed the men, he set up 
"a cloud and smoke by day" and a "flaming fire by night." <a href="../is/4.html#4">4:4-5</a>

<p><li>"He has stretched forth his hand against them  ... and the hills did tremble." (God makes earthquakes when he gets angry.)

<p><li>"I [Isaiah] saw also the LORD sitting upon a throne." <a href="../is/6.html#1">6:1</a>

<p><li>Isaiah sees angels with six wings. Two to cover his face, two to cover his feet, and two to fly with. <a href="../is/6.html#2">6:2</a>

<p><li>When the angels (or God?) cry, the door posts move and the house fills with smoke. <a href="../is/6.html#4">6:4</a>

<p><li>"Woe is me! ... because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips." <a href="../is/6.html#5">6:5</a>

<p><li>God will shave men's feet, where "feet" and "hair" are biblical euphemisms for males sexual organs and pubic hair,
respectively. <a href="../is/7.html#20">7:20</a>

<p><li>Isaiah has sex with a prophetess who conceives and bears a son. (You weren't expecting a daughter, were you?) God then

shall be very small and feeble." <a href="../is/16.html#14">16:14</a>

<p><li>God will ride in on a cloud and scare the hell out of the Egyptians. <a href="../is/19.html#1">19:1</a>

<p><li>Egypt will become weakened and frightened "like unto women" when God shakes his hand over it.
  <a href="../is/19.html#16">19:16</a>

<p><li>God tells Isaiah to take off all his clothes and to wander about completely naked for three years as a "sign and a wonder."
In this way he will be just like the Egyptian captives who will walk about naked "with their buttocks uncovered."  
<a href="../is/20.html#2">20:2-5</a>

<p><li>While walking around naked for three years, Isaiah's loins were filled with pain. <a href="../is/21.html#3">21:3</a>

<p><li>"In that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call ... to baldness." <a href="../is/22.html#12">22:12</a>

it "reels to and fro like a drunkard." <a href="../is/24.html#1">24:1, 18-20</a>

<p><li> "The foundations of the earth do shake ... The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard."<br>
(Earthquakes are all a part of God's wondrous plan.) <a href="../is/24.html#18">24:18-20</a>

<p><li>God will punish the leviathan ("that crooked serpent") with his own sword and will kill the sea dragon. 
<a href="../is/27.html#1">27:1</a>

<p><li>"For the Lord shall rise up ... that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring
    to pass his act, his strange act." <a href="../is/28.html#21">28:21</a>

<a href="../is/29.html#14">29:14</a>

<p><li>"The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be
     sevenfold." Well, this is one prophecy that will never come true. Since the moon has no light of its own, but only 
     reflects that of the sun, it could never shine like the sun. And the sun will not, at least not while there are humans to see 
     it, shine 7 times as bright as it does now.  <a href="../is/30.html#26">30:26</a>
     
<p><li>God's lips, tongue, and breath are described for us.  <a href="../is/30.html#27">30:27-28</a>

<p><li>"The LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall shew
    the lighting down of his armwith the indignation of his anger, and with

<p><li>God has bad breath, "like a stream of brimstone. Sometimes he even kindles a fire with it. <a href="../is/30.html#33">30:33</a>

<p><li>God is furious at everyone and is ready to kill them all. Or as Isaiah so delicately puts it: "Their stink shall come up
out of their carcasses, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood."  <a href="../is/34.html#2">34:2-3</a>

<p><li>"The host of heaven shall be dissolved ... and ... shall fall down."<br>
The stars will dissolve and fall from the sky. <a href="../is/34.html#4">34:4</a>

<a href="../is/34.html#13">34:13-14</a>

<p><li>"And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness."<br>

they were all dead men."  <a href="../is/37.html#36">37:36</a>

<p><li>God makes the sun move backwards 10 degrees. Now that's a neat trick!  <a href="../is/38.html#8">38:8</a>

<p><li> The grass and the flowers die when God blows on them. The same happens with people. <a href="../is/40.html#7">40:7</a>

<p><li>"The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over
    with gold, and casteth silver chains. He ... chooseth a tree ... to prepare a graven
    image."</br>
    <a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2006/12/god-hates-christmas-trees.html">God hates 
Christmas trees</a> <a href="../is/40.html#19">40:19-20</a>

<p><li>God will "go forth as a mighty man" who cries and roars, and "will cry like a travailing woman." After he tires of
roaring and crying he'll "destroy and devour." What a guy.  <a href="../is/42.html#13">42:13</a>

<p><li>"When thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned." <a href="../is/43.html#2">43:2</a>

Not even Jesus? <a href="../is/43.html#11">43:11</a>

<p><li>Dragons and owls will thank God for irrigation.   <a href="../is/43.html#20">43:20</a>

<p><li>"He heweth him down cedars ... among the trees of the forest ... yea, he kindleth it, and baketh 
    bread ... he maketh it a graven image ... he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth himself, and saith, Aha, I am warm, 
    I have seen the fire."</br>

<p><li>"I have sworn by myself." <a href="../is/45.html#23">45:23</a>

<p><li>God set the earth on foundations so it doesn't move, his hand is as big as the universe, 
and the stars stand up straight when he calls them. <a href="../is/48.html#13">48:13</a> 

<p><li>God engraved the names of his favorite people on the palms of his hands. <a href="../is/49.html#16">49:16</a>

<a href="../is/57.html#9">57:9</a>

<p><li>Bad people hatch poisonous cockatrice eggs. Whoever eats the eggs will die, and 
when the eggs are crushed a viper hatches out of them. <a href="../is/59.html#5">59:5</a>

<p><li>Nations that do not serve Israel will perish.  <a href="../is/60.html#12">60:12</a>
