Moroni asks those who don't believe in Christ what they will say when the end of the world comes and they are about to be 
thrown in with the damned souls in hell -- that there is no God? 

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif" >
The elements shall melt with fervent heat. -- <a href="../../2pet/3.html#10">2 Peter 3:10</a>
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>9:2</b>   Behold, will ye believe in the day of your visitation -- behold, when the Lord shall come, yea, even that 
great day when the earth shall be rolled together as a scroll, and 
  <span class="plag">the elements shall melt with fervent heat</span>, yea, in that 
great day when ye shall be brought to stand before the Lamb of God -- <span class="int">then will ye say that there is no God?
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>9:3</b>   Then will ye longer deny the Christ, or can ye behold the Lamb of God?  Do ye suppose that ye shall dwell 
with him under a consciousness of your guilt?  Do ye suppose that ye could be happy to dwell with that holy Being, when your 
souls are racked with a consciousness of guilt that ye have ever abused his laws? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>9:4</b>   Behold, I say unto you that ye would be more miserable to dwell with a holy and just God, under a consciousness 
of your filthiness before him, than <span class="int">ye would to dwell with the damned souls in hell.
  </span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>9:5</b>   For behold, when ye shall be brought to see your nakedness before God, and also the glory of God, and the 
holiness of Jesus Christ, it will kindle a flame of unquenchable fire upon you. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Moroni suggests that unbelievers turn to God so that they might be made fair and white.
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>9:7</b>   And again I speak unto you who deny the revelations of God, and say that they are done away, that there 
are no revelations, nor prophecies, nor gifts, nor healing, nor speaking with tongues, and the interpretation of tongues; 
<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>9:8</b>   Behold I say unto you, he that denieth these things knoweth not the gospel of Christ; yea, he has not read 
the scriptures; if so, he does not understand them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>9:9</b>   For do we not read that God is 
  <span class="plag">the same yesterday, today, and forever</span>, and 
  <span class="plag">in him there is no variableness 
neither shadow of changing</span>? <td bgcolor="eeeeee" rowspan="2" valign="top">

</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>9:10</b>   And now if ye have imagined up unto yourselves a god who doth vary, and in whom there is shadow of 
changing, then have ye imagined up unto yourselves a god who is not God of miracles.

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>9:11</b>   But behold, I will show unto you a God of miracles, even the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the 
God of Jacob; and it is that same God who created the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>9:12</b>   Behold he created Adam, and by Adam came the fall of man.   And because of the fall of man came Jesus Christ, 
even the Father and the Son; and because of Jesus Christ came the redemption of man. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>9:13</b>   And because of the redemption of man, which came by Jesus Christ, they are brought back into the presence 
of the Lord; yea, this is wherein all men are redeemed, because the death of Christ bringeth to pass the resurrection, which 
bringeth to pass a redemption from an endless sleep, from which sleep all men shall be awakened by the power of God when 
the trump shall sound; and they shall come forth, both small and great, and all shall stand before his bar, being redeemed 
and loosed from this eternal band of death, which death is a temporal death. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>9:14</b>   And then cometh the judgment of the Holy One upon them; and then cometh the time that<span class="plag"> he that is filthy 
shall be filthy still; and he that is righteous shall be righteous still</span>; he that is happy shall be happy still; and he 
that is unhappy shall be unhappy still. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/plag.gif" >
He which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still.
 -- <a href="../../rev/22.html#11">Revelation 22:11</a>
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>9:15</b>   And now, O all ye that have imagined up unto yourselves a god who can do no miracles, I would ask of 
you, have all these things passed, of which I have spoken?  Has the end come yet?  Behold I say unto you, Nay; and God 
has not ceased to be a God of miracles. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>9:16</b>   Behold, are not the things that God hath wrought marvelous in our eyes?  Yea, and who can comprehend the 
marvelous works of God? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>9:17</b>   Who shall say that it was not a miracle that by his word the heaven and the earth should be; and by the 
power of his word man was created of the dust of the earth; and by the power of his word have miracles been wrought? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>9:18</b>   And who shall say that Jesus Christ did not many mighty miracles?  And there were many mighty miracles 
wrought by the hands of the apostles. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>9:19</b>   And if there were miracles wrought then, why has God ceased 
to be a God of miracles and yet be an unchangeable Being?  And behold, I say unto you he changeth not; if so he would 
cease to be God; and he ceaseth not to be God, and is a God of miracles. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>9:20</b>   And <span class="a">the reason why he ceaseth to do miracles among the children of men is 
because that they dwindle 
in unbelief</span>, and depart from the right way, and know not the God in whom they should trust. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" >
Jesus doesn't do miracles any more because everyone has <a href="diu_list.html">dwindled in unbelief</a>.

  <span class="a">whoso believeth in Christ, doubting nothing, whatsoever he shall ask the

the earth. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

rise up against the almighty power of the Lord?  Who will despise the works of the Lord?  Who will despise the children of 
Christ?  Behold, all ye who are despisers of the works of the Lord, for ye shall wonder and perish.

and come unto the Lord with all your heart, and <span class="plag">work out your own salvation with fear and trembling</span> before him.

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" >(9:32-33) <i>"We have written this record ... in&nbsp; <b>reformed Egyptian</b>."</i><br>
The book of Mormon was written in""reformed Egyptian". If the plates had of been larger, Moroni would have used Hebrew and there wouldn't have been so many 
mistakes. (Reformed Egyptian is a really tricky language.)

<tr><td><b><a name="33"></a>9:33</b>   And <span class="a">if our plates had been sufficiently large we should have written in Hebrew</span>; but the Hebrew hath been 
altered by us also; and <span class="c">if we could have written in Hebrew, behold, ye would have had no imperfection in our record.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="34"></a>9:34</b>   But the Lord knoweth the things which we have written, and also that none other people knoweth our 
language; and <span class="a">because that none other people knoweth our language, therefore he hath prepared means for the interpretation 
thereof. </span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Because nobody knows "reformed Egyptian" anymore, God arranged for Joseph Smith to translate them.

the knowledge of Christ, are according to the prayers of all the saints who have dwelt in the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="37"></a>9:37</b>   And may the Lord Jesus Christ grant that their prayers may be answered according to their faith; and may
 God the Father remember the covenant which he hath made with the house of Israel; and may he bless them forever, through
