<p><li>Mathathias showed his "zeal for the law" by murdering a man on the altar along with an officer of Antiochus. <a href="2.html#24">2:24-25</a>

<p><li>Matthathias and his friends gathered an army, slew the sinners, threw down altars, and valiantly circumcised all the uncircumcised children they could find. <a href="2.html#39">2:39-48</a>

<p><li>Before he dies, Mathathias praises some of the nastiest characters in the Bible: <a href="../../gen/22.html#1">Abraham</a>,

 <a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2006/07/david-man-after-gods-own-heart-wwdd.html">David</a>, 
 <a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2009/09/gods-32nd-killing-jericho-massacre.html">Joshua</a> (Jesus) and 
 <a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/search?q=Elijah">Elijah</a> (Elias). <a href="2.html#52">2:52-58</a>

<p><li>"Revenge ye the wrong of your people ... Render to the Gentiles their reward."<br>
Take revenge on the Gentiles. Kill them all. <a href="2.html#67">2:67-68</a>

<p><li>Judas Machabeus replaced his father (Mathathias) as the leader of the Jewish 
	terrorists. His first act was to burn "them that troubled his people" (with fire). <a href="3.html#1">3:1-5</a>
	
<p><li>"He went through the cities of Juda, and destroyed the wicked out of them." <a href="3.html#8">3:8</a>	

<p><li>Seron, the captain of the Syrian army, heard about Judas (as had everyone on earth). He collected a large army of wicked 
men to fight Judas. When Judas' smaller army saw the Syrians, they were frightened. But Judas told them not to worry. Because 
success in war depends not on numbers, but on God. "The Lord himself will overthrow them." <a href="3.html#13">3:13</a>

 <p><li>"As soon as he had made an end of speaking, he rushed suddenly upon them: and Seron and his host were overthrown before him ... 
 and there fell of them eight hundred men." <a href="3.html#23">3:23-24</a>

<p><li>Judas and his completely unarmed valiant men defeat 5000 well-armed soldiers. Judas told his men not to do anything; God would do 
 the killing for them. And he did. God killed 3000 Gentile soldiers, and Judas and his men enriched themselves with the booty. 
 <a href="4.html#1">4:1-24</a>

<p><li>Judas asks God to help him kill more Gentiles, and God delivers another 5000. <a href="4.html#28">4:28-34</a>
