<p><li>God tells Lehi to send his sons back to Jerusalem to get some women. <a href="7.html#1">7:1-2</a>

<p><li>After the spirit showed Nephi the exceedingly white tree and virgin, 
it blathered on a bit about "the condescension of God" and whatnot. Then it told Nephi that the white virgin "is the mother of the Son 
of God, after the manner of the flesh." (Does this mean that God the Father had sex with Mary "after the manner of the flesh?")
