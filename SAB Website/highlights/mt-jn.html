<h3><a href="../mt/intro.html" target="_top">Matthew</a></h3>
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../mt/highlights.html" TAG="BODY" startspan --><li>Jesus strongly approved of the law and the prophets. He had no objection to the cruelties of the Old Testament and 
said that its laws will be binding forever. 
    <A href="../mt/5.html#17" target="_top">5:17</A>
    
  <p><li>To avoid sin, Jesus told his followers to cut off their hands and pluck
    out their eyes. This advice was given immediately after he said that anyone who
    looks with lust at a women commits adultery. <A href="../mt/5.html#29" target="_top">5:29</A>, <A href="../mt/18.html#8" target="_top" >18:8</A>
    
  <p><li>Jesus told his disciples not to pray in public. <A href="../mt/6.html#5" target="_top">6:5-6</A>
  
  <p><li>He said that most people are going to hell. <A href="../mt/7.html#13" target="_top">7:13-14</A>
  
  <p><li>He sent some devils into a herd of pigs, causing them to run off
    a cliff and drown in the waters below. <A href="../mt/8.html#32" target="_top" >8:32</A>
    
  <p><li>Families will be torn apart because of Jesus (this is one of the few &quot;prophecies&quot; in the Bible that has 
  actually come true). &quot;Brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall 
  rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death." <A href="../mt/10.html#21" target="_top" >10:21</A>
  
  <p><li>Jesus came to destroy families by making family  members hate each other. He 
came &quot;not 
  to send peace, but a sword.&quot; <A href="../mt/10.html#34" target="_top" >10:34-37</A>
  
  <p><li>He condemned entire cities to dreadful deaths and to the eternal torment of hell because they didn't care for 
  his preaching. <A href="../mt/11.html#20" target="_top" >11:20-24</A>
  
  <p><li>He spoke in parables so that no one would understand him, "lest ... they ... 
  should understand ... and should be converted, and I should heal them." <A href="../mt/13.html#10" target="_top">13:10-15</A>
  
  <p><li>"For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him 
  shall be taken away even that he hath." Isn't this from the Republican Party platform? 
  <A href="../mt/13.html#12" target="_top" >13:12</A>, <A href="../mt/25.html#29" target="_top">25:29</A>
  
  <p><li>Jesus was rejected by those who knew him best -- the people of his home town of Nazareth. 
  <A href="../mt/13.html#55" target="_top" >13:55-57</A>
  
  <p><li>Herod thought Jesus was a resurrected John the Baptist. Apparently, it was a common opinion at the time. <A href="../mt/14.html#2" target="_top" >14:2</A>, <A href="../mt/16.html#13" target="_top" >16:13-14</A>
  
  <p><li>Jesus told his followers that he would return and establish his kingdom within their lifetime. 
  <A href="../mt/16.html#28" target="_top">16:28</A>, <A href="../mt/23.html#36" target="_top" >23:36</A>, <A href="../mt/24.html#34" target="_top" >24:34</A>
  
  <p><li>Abandon your wife and children for Jesus and he'll give your a big reward. <A href="../mt/19.html#29" target="_top" >19:29</A>
  
  <p><li>Matthew's Jesus rode into Jerusalem sitting on <I>both</I> an ass
    and a colt (must have taken some practice!). <A href="../mt/21.html#2" target="_top">21:2-7</A>
    
  <p><li>"His blood be on us, and on our children." This verse blames the Jews for the death of Jesus and has been used
    to justify their persecution for twenty centuries. <A href="../mt/27.html#25" target="_top">27:25</A>

<a href="../mk/intro.html" target="_top">Mark</a></h3>
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../mk/highlights.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

  <li>Jesus casts out a godly "unclean spirit." <a href="../mk/1.html#23" target="_top">1:23-25</a>
  
  <p><li>He heals "all that were diseased" by casting out devils. The devils knew Jesus, but Jesus told them to shut up about it. 
  <a href="../mk/1.html#32" target="_top">1:32-34</a>
  
  <p><li>Although the disciples weren't sure about Jesus even after his alleged resurrection, the "unclean spirits" knew that he was "the son of God."
   But Jesus told them not to tell anyone. <a href="../mk/3.html#11" target="_top">3:11-12</a>
  
  <p><li>Jesus' friends think he is insane. <A href="../mk/3.html#21" target="_top">3:21</A>
  
  <p><li>The scribes think that Jesus casts out devils by the power of the prince of devils, Beelzebub. <a href="../mk/3.html#22" target="_top">3:22</a>
  
  <p><li>Jesus is angry at those who said that he had an unclean spirit, so he announces the unforgivable sin: blasphemy against the Holy Ghost.
  <a href="../mk/3.html#29" target="_top">3:29</a>
  
  <p><li>He shows disrespect for his mother and family by asking, "Who is my mother, or my brethren?" when he is told that his family wants to
   speak with him. <a hrf="3.html#31" target="_top">3:31-34</a>
  
  <p><li>He explains why he speaks in parables: to confuse people so they will go to hell. <A href="../mk/4.html#10" target="_top">4:10-12</A>
  
  <p><li>He says that those who have been less fortunate in this life will
    have it even worse in the life to come. <A href="../mk/4.html#25" target="_top">4:25</A>
    
  <p><li>He sends the devils into 2000 pigs, causing them to jump off a cliff and be drowned in the sea. <A href="../mk/5.html#11" target="_top">5:11-17</A>
  
  <p><li>He is rejected by those who knew him the best, the people from his home town of Nazareth. <A href="../mk/6.html#2" target="_top">6:2-5</A>
  
  <p><li>Any city that doesn't &quot;receive&quot; the followers of Jesus will be destroyed in a manner even more savage than 
  that of Sodom and Gomorrah. <A href="../mk/6.html#11" target="_top">6:11</A>
  
  <p><li>Jesus criticizes the Jews for not killing their disobedient children according to Old Testament law. 
  <A href="../mk/7.html#9" target="_top">7:9-10</A>
  
  <p><li>He refused to cast out a devil from a Greek woman's daughter, calling the woman a "dog". After much pleading, 
  he finally agrees to cast out her daughter's devil. <a href="../mk/7.html#25" target="_top">7:25-30</a>
  
  <p><li>He put his fingers in a deaf man's ears, then spit and touched his tongue. This treatment immediately cured him. 
  <a href="../mk/7.html#32" target="_top">7:32-35</a>
  
  <p><li>He cured a blind man by spitting in his eyes. <a href="../mk/8.html#22" target="_top">8:22-23</a>
  
  <p><li>There were various opinions about the identity of Jesus. Some thought he was Elijah or one of the prophets. And many thought he was a 
  risen John the Baptist. <a href="../mk/8.html#27" target="_top">8:27-28</a>
  
  <p><li>Jesus falsely prophesied that the end of the world would come within his listeners' lifetimes. <A href="../mk/9.html#1" target="_top">9:1</A>, 
  <A href="../mk/13.html#30" target="_top">13:30</A>
  
  <p><li>He said that John the Baptist was Elijah, but John the Baptist explicitly denied it in John 1:21. <a href="../mk/9.html#13" target="_top">9:13</a>
  
  <p><li>He tells us to cut off our hands and feet, and pluck out our eyes to avoid going to hell. <A href="../mk/9.html#43" target="_top">9:43-49</A>
  
  <p><li>He will reward men who abandon their wives and families. <A href="../mk/10.html#29" target="_top">10:29-30</A>
  
  <p><li>He kills a fig tree for not bearing figs, even though it was out of season. <A href="../mk/11.html#13" target="_top">11:13-14</A>
  
  <p><li>There is no sex or marriage in heaven. <a href="../mk/12.html#18" target="_top">12:18-25</a>
  
  <p><li>Ointment for Jesus' head is more important than helping the poor. <a href="../mk/14.html#3" target="_top">14:3-7</a>
  
  <p><li>These verses are not found in the earlier manuscripts and are therefore considered later additions. <a href="../mk/16.html#9" target="_top">16:9-20</a>  
   
<p><li>The risen Jesus transformed himself into a different form, appearing as a completely different person. <a href="../mk/16.html#12" target="_top">16:12-13</a>
    
  <p><li>"He that believeth not shall be damned." <A href="../mk/16.html#16" target="_top">16:16</A>
    
  <p><li>True followers of Christ routinely perform the following tricks: cast out devils, speak in tongues, 
  handle poisonous snakes, drink poisons without harm, and cure the sick by touching them.	<A href="../mk/16.html#17" target="_top">16:17-18</A>

  <p><li>John the Baptist says that Christ will burn the damned &quot;with fire unquenchable.&quot; <A href="../lk/3.html#17" target="_top" >3:17</A>
  
  <p><li>The genealogy of Jesus given here is entirely different than that in <A href="../mt/1.html#6" target="_top">Mt.1:6-16</A>. 
  <A href="../lk/3.html#23" target="_top" >3:23-31</A>
  
  <p><li>Peter and his partners (James and John) abandon their wives and children to follow Jesus. <A href="../lk/5.html#11" target="_top" >5:11</A>
  
  <p><li>People who are rich, well-fed, happy, or respected are going to hell. <A href="../lk/6.html#24" target="_top" >6:24-26</A>
  
  <p><li>John the Baptist, who is about to die, is still unsure about Jesus. <A href="../lk/7.html#19" target="_top" >7:19</A>
  
  <p><li>Jesus speaks in parables so &quot;that seeing they
    might not see, and hearing they might not understand.&quot; <A href="../lk/8.html#10" target="_top" >8:10</A>
    
  <p><li>He falsely predicts that some of his listeners would live to see
    him return and establish the kingdom of God. <A href="../lk/9.html#27" target="_top">9:27</A>
    
  <p><li>Entire cities will be violently destroyed and the inhabitants &quot;thrust down to hell&quot; for 
  not &quot;receiving&quot;  his disciples. <A href="../lk/10.html#10" target="_top" >10:10-15</A>
  
  <p><li>The disciples are thrilled that &quot;even the devils are subject&quot; to them. To this Jesus replies, &quot;I give 
  unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions ... and nothing shall by any means hurt
    you.&quot;&nbsp; <A href="../lk/10.html#17" target="_top" >10:17-19</A>
    
  <p><li>Jesus thanks God that only the ignorant and foolish will listen to him. <A href="../lk/10.html#21" target="_top" >10:21</A>
  
  <p><li>He insults his mother (the Most Holy Blessed Virgin Mary). <a href="../lk/11.html#27" target="_top">11:27-28</a>
  
  <p><li>He calls his critics fools, thus making himself, by his own standards (<A href="../mt/5.html#22" target="_top" >Mt.5:22</A>), 
  worthy of &quot;hell fire.&quot; <A href="../lk/11.html#40" target="_top" >11:40</A>

    and then torture us forever in hell. <A href="../lk/12.html#5" target="_top" >12:5</A>
    
  <p><li>The unforgivable sin: blasphemy against the Holy Ghost. <a href="../lk/12.html#10" target="_top">12:10</a>

  God.&quot; <A href="../lk/16.html#15" target="_top" >16:15</A>
  
  <p><li>Abandon your wife and family for Jesus and he'll give you a big reward. <a href="../lk/18.html#30" target="_top">18:29-30</a>
  
 <p><li>God is like an unjust king who takes what is not rightly his, reaps what he didn't sow, and has those who don't 
 want to be ruled by him slaughtered in front of him. <A href="../lk/19.html#12" target="_top" >19:12-27</A>

  <p><li>He says that all that he describes (his return, signs in the sun,

<a href="../jn/intro.html" target="_top">John</a></h3>
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../jn/highlights.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

 <p><li>Jesus told Nathaniel that he would see heaven open and angels descend upon Jesus. 
  Nathaniel never saw it; neither has anyone else. <a href="../jn/1.html#51" target="_top">1:51</a>
  
  <p><li>He believed the stupid and vicious story from <a href="../num/21.html#4" target="_top">Numbers 21</a>. 
(God sent snakes to bite the people for complaining about the lack of food and water. Then God told
 Moses to make a brass snake to cure them from the bites.)  <a href="../jn/3.html#14" target="_top">3:14</a>
  
  <p><LI>Those who, for whatever reason, do not believe in Jesus are tormented forever in hell. <A href="../jn/3.html#18" target="_top">3:18</A>, <a href="../jn/8.html#24" target="_top">8:24</a>, 
  <a href="../jn/15.html#6" target="_top">15:6</a>
  
  <p><LI>The wrath of God is on all unbelievers. <A href="../jn/3.html#36" target="_top" >3:36</A>
  
  <p><li> Jesus magically perceived that a Samaritan woman had been married and divorced five times previously. (He could spot a divorced woman a mile away.) 
  <a href="../jn/4.html#7" target="_top">4:7-18</a>
  
 <p><li>He believed people are crippled by God as a punishment for sin. He told a crippled man, after healing him, to
"sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee."  <a href="../jn/5.html#14" target="_top">5:14</a>

 <p><li>The people of Nazareth, who knew Jesus well, (his family, friends, and 
	neighbors) didn't believe in him.  <a href="../jn/6.html#42" target="_top">6:42</a>, <a href="../jn/7.html#5" target="_top">7:5</a>
    
  <p><LI>Jesus says we must eat his flesh and drink his blood if we want to have eternal life. <A href="../jn/6.html#53" t target="_top">6:53</A>
  
 <p><li>A man was born blind so that Jesus could show off his powers by curing him of his blindness. <a href="../jn/9.html#1" target="_top">9:1-3</a>
  
  <p><li>Jesus spits on the ground, mixes his spit with the dirt, and rubs the muddy spit on (or in?) a blind man's eyes. <a href="../jn/9.html#6" target="_top">9:6</a>
  
  <p><li>Everyone that ever lived before Jesus was a thief and a robber. <a href="../jn/10.html#8" target="_top">10:8</a>
  
  <p><li>Many of those who saw Jesus firsthand thought he was mad and possessed by a devil. <a href="../jn/10.html#10" target="_top">10:10</a>
  
  <p><li>Lazarus suffered and died (or pretend to die) so that Jesus could be "be glorified" by raising him from the dead. 
  <a href="../jn/11.html#4" target="_top">11:4</a>
  
  <p><li>Mary wastes expensive ointment on Jesus' feet, rather than selling the ointment and giving the money to the poor. But Jesus thinks his feet are more important,
   saying that poor people will always be around, but he and his precious feet won't be. <a href="../jn/12.html#3" target="_top">12:3-8</a>
   
   <p><li>Jesus was wrong about seeds. If a seed dies, it dies. It only produces a new plant if it stays alive (in a dormant stage) until it germinates. Dead 
   seeds bring forth no fruit. <a href="../jn/12.html#24" target="_top">12:24</a>
   
   <p><li>You must hate your life in order to keep it. (If you love your life, you'll go to hell after you die.) <a href="../jn/12.html#25" target="_top">12:25</a>
  
  <p><LI>God hardened the hearts of the Jews to prevent them from believing in Jesus. <A href="../jn/12.html#40" target="_top" >12:40</A>
  
  <p><li>Those who believe in Jesus will be able to perform even greater miracles than he did! <a href="../jn/14.html#12" target="_top">14:12</a>
  
  <p><li> If you don't like Jesus, then you don't like God. (You're a damned God hater.) <a href="../jn/15.html#23" target="_top">15:23</a>
  
  <p><li>Christians always get whatever they ask for in prayer. <a href="../jn/15.html#7" target="_top">15:7</a>, <a href="../jn/15.html#16" target="_top">16</a>; 
  <a href="../jn/16.html#23" target="_top">16:23</a>
  
  <p><li>The Jews are blamed for the death of Jesus. <a href="../jn/19.html#7" target="_top">19:7-15</a>
  
  <p><li>After his resurrection, Jesus could walk through walls. <a href="../jn/20.html#19" target="_top">20:19</a>, <a href="../jn/20.html#26" target="_top">26</a>
  
 <p><LI>Jesus implies that he will return to earth during the lifetime of John. <A href="../jn/21.html#22" target="_top" >21:22</A>
