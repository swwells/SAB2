<p><li>Two of the sons of Aaron "offered strange fire before the Lord" and "there went out fire

    kill him too, along with everyone else. <a href="10.html#4">10:4-6</a>

<p><li>"She shall be unclean."<br>
Women are dirty and sinful after childbirth, so God prescribes rituals for their purification.

<p><li>"If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days ... And she shall then 
continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days."<br>

threescore and six days."<br>
If a girl is born, the mother is unclean for 14 days and be purified for 66 days. This is because, in the eyes of God, 
girls are twice as dirty as boys. <a href="12.html#5">12:5</a>

<p><li>"She shall bring a lamb ... for a burnt offering, and... a young pigeon, or dove, for a sin offering."<br>
After a woman gives birth, a priest must kill a lamb, pigeon, or dove as a sin offering. This is because having children is sinful and God likes it when things are 
killed for him. <a href="12.html#6">12:6</a>

<p><li>"She shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood." <a href="12.html#7">12:7</a>

<p><li>"If she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons ... and she shall be clean."

of your must be burned to death.  <a href="20.html#14">20:14</a>

<p><li>Don't have sex with your sister, uncle's wife, or your brother's wife -- and tell

 <p><li>A priest's daughter who "plays the whore" is to be burned to death.  <a href="21.html#9">21:9</a>
