<p><b><a href="../gen/abs_list.html">Genesis</a></b>


<p><li>God creates light and separates light from darkness, and day from night, on the first day.
Yet he didn't make the light producing objects (the sun and the stars) until the fourth day
(<a href="../gen/1.html#14">1:14-19</a>). <a href="../gen/1.html#3">1:3-5</a>

<p><li>God spends one-sixth of his entire creative effort (the second day) 
working on a solid firmament. This strange structure, which God calls heaven, is 
intended to separate the higher waters from the lower waters. <a href="../gen/1.html#6">1:6-8</a>

<p><li>Plants are made on the third day before there was a sun to drive their photosynthetic
processes (<a href="../gen/1.html#14">1:14-19</a>). <a href="../gen/1.html#11">1:11</a>

<p><li> In an apparent endorsement of astrology, God places the sun, moon, and stars in the firmament so that they can be used
"for signs". This, of course, is exactly what astrologers do: read "the signs" in the Zodiac in an effort to predict what 
will happen on Earth. <a href="../gen/1.html#14">1:14</a>

<p><li>"He made the stars also." God spends a day making light (before making the stars) and
separating light from darkness; then, at the end of a hard day's work, and almost as an
afterthought, he makes the trillions of stars. <a href="../gen/1.html#16">1:16</a> 

<p><li>&quot;And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the 
earth.&quot; <a href="../gen/1.html#17">1:17</a>

<p><li>God commands us to "be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have
     dominion over ... every living thing that moveth upon the earth.&quot;&nbsp; <a href="../gen/1.html#28">1:28</a>

<p><li>"I have given you every herb ... and every tree ... for meat."<br>
Since many plants have evolved poisons to protect against animals that would like to eat them, God's advice is more than a little reckless. 
Would you tell your children to go out in the garden and eat whatever plants they encounter? Of course not. But then, you are much nicer 
and smarter than God.   <a href="../gen/1.html#29">1:29</a>

<p><li>"He rested."<br>
Even God gets tired sometimes. <a href="../gen/2.html#2">2:2</a>

<p><li>"The tree of life ... and the tree of knowledge of good and evil." <br>
God created two magic trees: the tree of life and the tree of knowledge. Eat from the the first, and you live forever 
(<a href="../gen/3.html#22">3:22</a>); eat from the second and you'll die the same day (<a href="#17">2:17</a>). (Or that's what God said, anyway. 
Adam ate from the tree of knowledge and lived for another 930 years or so (<a href="../gen/5.html#5">5:5</a>). But he never got a change to eat from 
the tree of life. God prevented him from eating from the tree of life before Adam could eat from the tree, become a god, and live forever.)
<a href="../gen/2.html#9">2:9</a>
 
<p><li>God makes the animals and parades them before Adam to see if any would strike his
fancy. But none seem to have what it takes to please him. (Although he was tempted to go for
the sheep.) After making the animals, God has
Adam name them all. The naming of several million species must have kept Adam busy for a
while. <a href="../gen/2.html#18">2:18-20</a>

  <p><li>God's clever, talking serpent.&nbsp; <A href="../gen/3.html#1">3:1</A></LI>
  
  <p><li>God walks and talks (to himself?) in the garden, and plays a little hide and seek with
Adam and Eve. <a href="../gen/3.html#8">3:8-11</a>

<p><li>God curses the serpent. From now on the serpent will crawl on his belly and eat dust.
One wonders how he got around before -- by hopping on his tail, perhaps? But snakes don't
eat dust, do they? <a href="../gen/3.html#14">3:14</a>

<p><li>God curses the ground and causes thorns and thistles
to grow. <a href="../gen/3.html#17">3:17-18</a>

<p><li>God kills some animals and makes some skin coats for Adam and Eve. 
<a href="../gen/3.html#21">3:21</a>

<p><li><i>"Behold, the man is become as one of us."</i><br>
God expels Adam and Eve from the garden before they get a chance to eat from that other tree -- the tree of life.
God knows that if they do that, they well become "like one of us" and live forever. <a href="../gen/3.html#22">3:22-24</a>

<p><li>Cain is worried after killing Abel and says, "Every one who finds me shall slay me." This
is a strange concern since there were only two other humans alive at the time -- his parents! <a href="../gen/4.html#14">4:14</a>

<p><li>"And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD." <a href="../gen/4.html#16">4:16</a>

  <p><li>&nbsp;&quot;And Cain knew his wife.&quot; That's nice, but where the hell
    did she come from? <A href="../gen/4.html#17">4:17</A></LI>
    
<p><li>Lamech kills a man and claims that since Cain's murderer would be punished
sevenfold, whoever murders him will be punished seventy-seven fold. That sounds fair. <a href="../gen/4.html#23">4:23-24</a>

<p><li>"And to Seth ... was born a son." Where'd he find his wife? <a href="../gen/4.html#26">4:26</a>

<p><li>God created a man and a woman, and he "called their name Adam." So the woman's
name was Adam, too! <a href="../gen/5.html#2">5:2</a>

<p><li>The first men had incredibly long life spans. <a href="../gen/5.html#5">5:5</a>, 
<a href="../gen/5.html#8">5:8</a>, <a href="../gen/5.html#11">5:11</a>, <a href="../gen/5.html#14">5:14</a>,

<a href="../gen/5.html#17">5:17</a>, <a href="../gen/5.html#20">5:20</a>, <a href="../gen/5.html#23">5:23</a>,
<a href="../gen/5.html#27">5:27</a>, <a href="../gen/5.html#31">5:31</a>, <a href="../gen/9.html#29">9:29</a> 

<p><li>Enoch doesn't die he just ascends into heaven. <a href="../gen/5.html#21">5:21-24</a>

<p><li>When Lamech was born, nine generations were alive at once. Adam, Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, Methuselah, and Lamech were all alive at 
the time of Lamech's birth. Adam lived to see his great-great-great-great-great-great-grandson. <a href="../gen/5.html#25">5:25</a>

<p><li>When Noah was 500 years old, he had three sons. <br>[Three sons in one year? Was that with one (nameless) wife or 
several?]  <a href="../gen/5.html#32">5:32</a>
 
  <p><li><i>"The sons of God came in unto the daughters of men."</i><br>
  The &quot;sons of God&quot; had sex with the &quot;daughters of
    men,&quot; and had sons who became &quot;the mighty men of old, men of
    renown.&quot; <A href="../gen/6.html#2">6:2-4</A></LI>
    
 <p><li>"The LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh."<br>
God shortened the human lifespan to 120 years because humans are "flesh" and he was tired of fighting with them.  <a href="../gen/6.html#3">6:3</a> 
    
  <p><li><i>"There were giants in the earth in those days."</i> <a href="../gen/6.html#4">6:4</A></LI>
    
    <p><li>God decides to kill all living things because the human imagination is evil. 
    Later (<a href="../gen/8.html#21">8:21</a>), after he kills everything, he promises never to do it again because the human 
    imagination is evil. Go figure. <a href="../gen/6.html#5">6:5</a>

  <p><li>God repents. <A href="../gen/6.html#6">6:6-7</A></LI>
  
  <p><li><i>"Noah was a just man and perfect."</i><br>
  Noah is called a "just man and perfect," but 
he didn't seem so perfect when he was drunk and naked in front of his sons (<a href="../gen/9.html#20">9:20-21</a>). <a href="../gen/6.html#9">6:9</a>, 
<a href="../gen/7.html#1">7:1</a>

  <p><li><i>"Behold, I will destroy them with the earth."</i><br>
  God was angry because "the earth was filled with violence." So he killed every living thing to make the 
  world less violent. <a href="../gen/6.html#11">6:11-13</a>
  
<p><li>Noah is told to make an ark that is 450 feet long. <a href="../gen/6.html#14">6:14-15</a>

 <p><li>God tells Noah to make one small window (18 inches square) in the 450 
  foot ark for ventilation.  <a href="../gen/6.html#16">6:16</a>
  
  <p><li>"And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten ... for thee, and for them." <a href="../gen/6.html#21">6:21</a>
  
  <p><li>"Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens."<br>
  How did Noah know which animals were "clean" and "unclean" to God? (It wasn't defined until Leviticus was written.) <a href="../gen/7.html#2">7:2</a>
  
<p><li>Whether by twos or by sevens, Noah takes male and female representatives from each
species of "every thing that creepeth upon the earth." <a href="../gen/7.html#8">7:8</a>

    <p><li>God opens the "windows of heaven." He does this every time it rains. <a href="../gen/7.html#11">7:11</a>
    
  <p><li>All of the animals boarded the ark "in the selfsame day."  <a href="../gen/7.html#13">7:13-14</a>
  
  <p><li>"And God remembered Noah."<br>
 Yeah. He probably said something like, "Isn't Noah the guy who built the ark?" <a href="../gen/8.html#1">8:1</a>
  
  <p><li>"The windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from  heaven was restrained." This 
happens whenever it stops raining. <a href="../gen/8.html#2">8:2</a>

<p><li>Noah sends a dove out to see if there was any dry land. But the dove returns without
finding any. Then, just seven days later, the dove goes out again and returns with an olive leaf.
But how could an olive tree survive the flood? And if any seeds happened to survive, they
certainly wouldn't germinate and grow leaves within a seven day period. <a href="../gen/8.html#8">8:8-11</a> 

<p><li><i>"And the Lord smelled a sweet savor."</i><br>
Noah kills the "clean beasts" and burns their dead bodies for God. According to 7:8
this would have caused the extinction of all "clean" animals since only two of each were taken
onto the ark. "And the Lord smelled a sweet savor." After this God "said in his heart" that he'd
never do it again because "man's heart is evil from his youth." So God killed all living things
(<a href="../gen/6.html#5">6:5</a>) because humans are evil, and then promises not to do it again 
(<a href="../gen/8.html#21">8:21</a>) because humans are
evil. The mind of God is a frightening thing. <a href="../gen/8.html#20">8:20-21</a>

<p><li>According to this verse, all animals fear humans. Although it is true that many do, it is also 
true that some do not. Sharks and grizzly bears, for example, are generally much 
less afraid of us than we are of them. <a href="../gen/9.html#2">9:2</a>

<p><li><i>"Into your hand are they (the animals) delivered."</i><br>
God gave the animals to humans, and they can do whatever 
they please with them. This verse has been used by bible believers to justify all kinds of cruelty to 
animals and environmental destruction. <a href="../gen/9.html#2">9:2</a>

<p><li>God is rightly filled with remorse for having
killed his creatures. He makes a deal with the animals, promising never to drown 
them all again. He even puts the rainbow in the sky so that whenever he sees it, 
it will remind him of his promise so that he won&#39;t be tempted to do it again. 
(Every time God sees the rainbow he says to himself: &quot;Oh, yeah.... That&#39;s right. 
I promised not to drown the animals again. I guess I&#39;ll have to find something 
else to do.&quot;).  <a href="../gen/9.html#9">9:9-13</a>

  <p><li><i>"Noah ... drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent."</i><br>
Noah, the drunk and naked.&nbsp; <A href="../gen/9.html#20">9:20-21</A></LI>
  
<p><li>The entire tenth chapter is the first of many boring genealogies 
(see <a href="../1chr/1.html#1">1 Chr.1-9</a>,

<a href="../mt/1.html#1">Mt.1:1-17</a>, <a href="../lk/3.html#23">Lk.3:23-28</a> for 
other examples) that we are told to avoid in <a href="../1tim/1.html#4">1 Tim.1:4</a> 
and <a href="../tit/3.html#9">Tit.3:9</a>
("Avoid foolish questions and genealogies.") <a href="../gen/10.html#1">10:1-32</a>

<p><li><i>"Now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do."</i><br>
God worries that the people will succeed in building a tower high enough to reach him (them?) in heaven, and that by 
so doing they will become omnipotent. <a href="../gen/11.html#4">11:4-6</a>

<p><li>God says, "Let <i>us</i> go down ..." Maybe he hasn't been talking to himself; maybe
there is more than one of them up there. Well, however many there may be,
they all decide to come down to confuse the builders by confounding human language and
scattering them [humans] abroad. <a href="../gen/11.html#7">11:7</a>

<p><li>Another boring genealogy that we are told to avoid in 
<a href="../1tim/1.html#4">1 Tim.1:4</a> and <a href="../tit/3.html#9">Tit.3:9</a>. ("Avoid foolish questions and 
genealogies.") Also note the ridiculously long lives of the patriarchs.  <a href="../gen/11.html#10">11:10-32</a>

<p><li>"I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee."<br>
God will beless you if you bless Abraham and curse you if you curse Abraham. Fuck Abraham. <a href="../gen/12.html#3">12:3</a>

<p><li>The Amalekites were smitten before Amalek (from whom they descended) was born.
Amalek was the grandson of Esau (<a href="../gen/36.html#12">Gen.36:12</a>). <a href="../gen/14.html#7">14:7</a>

<p><li>"And Abram fell on his face." <a href="../gen/17.html#3">17:3</a>

<p><li>Abraham laughs at God for telling him that he and Sarah will have a child, when they are 100 and 90 years old, respectively. 
<a href="../gen/17.html#17">17:17</a>

<p><li>Abraham circumcises himself and all of the males in his household. Since he supposedly 
had 318 slaves back in <a href="../gen/14.html#14" >14:14</a>, poor old Abe must have been pretty busy 
with his knife. But it was worth it. Penises are supremely important to God. And he can't stand foreskins.
 <a href="../gen/17.html#23">17:23-24</a>
 
 <p><li>Abraham feeds God and three angels. <a href="../gen/18.html#1">18:1-4</a>
 
 <p><li>"He took butter, and milk, and the calf ... and they did eat."<br>
    Not a very kosher meal for God and Abraham to eat! (See <a href="../ex/23.html#19">Exodus 23:19</a>) <a href="../gen/18.html#8">18:8</a>

 <p><li>Sarah, who is about 90 years old and has gone through menopause, laughs at God
when he tells her that she will have a son. She asks God if she will "have pleasure" with her
"Lord" [Abraham], when both are so very old. God assures her that he will return and
impregnate her at the appointed time. <a href="../gen/18.html#11">18:11-14</a>

<p><li>God, who is planning another mass murder, is worried that Abraham might try to stop
him. so he asks himself if he should hide his intentions from Abraham. 
<a href="../gen/18.html#17">18:17</a>

<p><li>"I will not destroy it for ten's sake."<br>
    I guess God couldn't find even ten good Sodomites because he decides to kill them all in <a href="../gen/19.html#1">Genesis 19</a>. 
    Too bad Abraham didn't ask God about the children. Why not save them? If Abraham could find 10 good children, toddlers, infants, or babies, would 
    God spare the city? Apparently not. God doesn't give a damn about children. <a href="../gen/18.html#32">18:32</a>


<p><li>"And the Lord went his way." Now where might that be? <a href="../gen/18.html#33">18:33</a>

<p><li>The two angels that visit Lot wash their feet, eat, and are sexually irresistible to Sodomites. 
<a href="../gen/19.html#1">19:1-5</a>

  <p><li>Lot [the just and righteous (<A href="../2pet/2.html#7" target="_top">2 Pet.2:7-8</A>)]
      offers his daughters to a crowd of angel rapers.&nbsp; <A href="../gen/19.html#8">19:8</A></LI>
      
<p><li>Lot lied about his daughters being "virgins" in <a href="../gen/19.html#8" >19:8</a>. But it was a "just and 
righteous" lie, intended to make them more attractive to the sex-crazed mob. <a href="../gen/19.html#14">19:14</a>

  <p><li>Lot's nameless wife looks back, and God
turns her into a pillar of salt. <a href="../gen/19.html#26">19:26</a></LI>

    <p><li>Lot and his daughters camp out in a cave for a while. The daughters get their "just
and righteous" father drunk, and have sexual intercourse with him, and each conceives and
bears a son (wouldn't you know it!). Just another wholesome family values Bible story. 
<a href="../gen/19.html#30">19:30-38</a>

<p><li>Honest Abe does the same "she's my sister" routine again, for the same cowardly reason.
And once again, the king just couldn't resist Sarah -- even though by now she is over 90 years
old. (See <a href="../gen/12.html#13">Gen.12:13-20</a> for the first, nearly identical, episode.)  
<a href="../gen/20.html#2">20:2</a>

<p><li>"The Lord visited Sarah" and he "did unto Sarah as he had spoken." And "Sarah
conceived and bare Abraham a son." (God-assisted conceptions never result in daughters.)  <a href="../gen/21.html#1">21:1-2</a>

<p><li>These verses suggest that Ishmael was an infant when his father abandoned him, yet
according to <a href="../gen/17.html#25">Gen.17:25</a> and <a href="../gen/21.html#5">Gen.21:5-8</a> 
he must have been about 16 years old. It must have
been tough for poor Hagar to carry Ishmael on her shoulder and to then "cast him 
under one of the shrubs." <a href="../gen/21.html#14">21:14-18</a>

<p><li>Abraham names the place where he nearly kills Isaac after Jehovah. But according to
<a href="../ex/6.html#3">Exodus 6:3</a>, Abraham couldn't have known that God's name was Jehovah. 
<a href="../gen/22.html#14">22:14</a>

<p><li>God swears to himself. <a href="../gen/22.html#16">22:16</a>

<p><li>Abraham needed God's help to father Isaac when he was 100 years old 
(<a href="../gen/21.html#1">Gen.21:1-2</a>,
<a href="../rom/4.html#19">Rom.4:19</a>, <a href="../heb/11.html#12">Heb.11:12</a>). 
But here, when he is even older, he manages to have six more children
without any help from God. <a href="../gen/25.html#2">25:2</a>

<p><li>Abraham lived to be 175 years old. <a href="../gen/25.html#7">25:7</a>

<p><li>Ishmael lived 137 years. <a href="../gen/25.html#17">25:17</a>

<p><li>"She was barren."<br>
In the Bible it's always the woman that are "barren", never the men. And when God "opens their womb," the resulting babies are always little 
boys. <a href="../gen/25.html#21">25:21-26</a>

<p><li>Esau and Jacob were already fighting each other in the womb. <a href="../gen/25.html#22">25:22</a>

<p><li>Esau sold his birthright to Jacob for a bit of bread and a bowl of lentil soup. <a href="../gen/25.html#33">25:33-34</a>

<p><li>Isaac uses the same "she's my sister" lie that his father used so effectively on the same king Abimelech. 
(see <a href="../gen/12.html#13">Gen.12:13</a>, <a href="../gen/20.html#2">20:2</a>). 

<a href="../gen/26.html#7">26:7</a>

<p><li> Jacob names Bethel for the first time, before  
meeting Rachel. Later in <a href="../gen/35.html#15">35:15</A>, just before Rachel dies, he  
names Bethel again. (And it was called Bethel long before it was named Bethel in <a href="../gen/12.html#8">12:8</a> and 
<a href="../gen/13.html#3">13:3</a>.) <a href="../gen/28.html#19">28:19</a>

<p><li>Jacob is tricked by Laban, the father of Rachel and Leah. Jacob asks for Rachel so
that he can "go in unto her." But Laban gives him Leah instead, and Jacob "went in unto her
[Leah]" by mistake. Jacob was fooled until morning -- apparently he didn't know who he was
going in unto. Finally they worked things out and Jacob got to "go in unto" Rachel, too. 
<a href="../gen/29.html#21">29:21-30</a>

<p><li>Jacob goes in unto Leah by mistake.&nbsp; <A href="../gen/29.html#23">29:23</A>, <A href="../gen/29.html#25">25</A></LI>
<p><li>"And Jacob went in unto her. And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son." (These
arrangements never seem to produce daughters.) <a href="../gen/30.html#4">30:4</a>

<p><li>Leah, not to be outdone, gives Jacob her maid (Zilpah) "to wife." And Zilpah "bare
Jacob a son." <a href="../gen/30.html#9">30:9</a>

<p><li>Rachel trades her husband's favors for some mandrakes. And so, when Jacob cam
home, Leah said: "Thou must come in unto me, for surely I have hired thee with my son's
mandrakes. And he lay with her that night." Presumably God, by telling us this edifying story, is
teaching us something about sexual ethics. <a href="../gen/30.html#15">30:15-16</a>

<p><li>And finally, "God remembered Rachel ... and opened her womb. And she conceived
and bare a son [surprise, surprise]." <a href="../gen/30.html#22">30:22</a>

<p><li>Laban learns "by experience" that God has blessed him for Jacob's sake. "By experience" 
means "by divination", at least that is how 
<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Genesis+30%3A27&x=12&y=10&NIV_version=yes&NASB_version=yes&ESV_version=yes&CEV_version=yes&language=english">most other versions</a> translate this verse.
 <a href="../gen/30.html#27">30:27</a>
 
<p><li>Jacob displays his (and God's) knowledge of biology by having goats copulate while
looking at streaked rods. The result is streaked baby goats. <a href="../gen/30.html#37">30:37-39</a>

<p><li>God (or an angel) praises Jacob for his fancy genetic work in <a href="../gen/30.html#37">Gen.30:37-39</a>. 

<a href="../gen/31.html#11">31:11-12</a>

<p><li>Jacob wrestles with god and wins. God changes Jacob's name to Israel to signify
that he wrestled with God and "prevailed." <a href="../gen/32.html#24">32:24-30</a> 

<p><li>Unable to beat Jacob in a fair fight, God dislocates Jacob's leg. <a href="../gen/32.html#25">32:25</a>

<p><li>God begs Jacobs to let him go, but Jacob says, "Not unless you bless me." So God blessed Jacob and Jacob let God go. 
<a href="../gen/32.html#26">32:26-29</a>

<p><li>"What is thy name?" (God didn't know Jacob's name.) <a href="../gen/32.html#27">32:27</a>

 <p><li>God renames Jacob for the first time. God says that Jacob will henceforth be called Israel, but the Bible continues to call him Jacob anyway. 
And even God himself calls him Jacob in <a href="../gen/46.html#2">46:2</a>. <a href="../gen/32.html#28">32:28</a> 

<p><li>"Tell me, I pray thee, thy name."<br>
God refuses to tell Jacob his name. (It's a secret.) <a href="../gen/32.html#29">32:29</a>

<p><li>"Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew ...."<br>
Jews don't eat the sinew of something or other because God messed with Jacob's leg while wrestling with him. (Now <i>that's</i> a good reason!) 
<a href="../gen/32.html#32">32:32</a>

<p><li>"I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God."<br>
Since Jacob just saw the face of God a few verses ago (<a href="../gen/32.html#30">Genesis 32:30</a>), he ought to know what God looks like. 
So now we do too. God looks just like Esau! Which is kind of strange, since <a href="../rom/9.html#13">God hates Esau</a>. So all those 
pictures of God that you've seen? They had it all wrong. God is a redhead, just like Esau was. In fact, God is covered with 
red hair all over his body. <a href="../gen/33.html#10">33:10</a>

<p><li>God renames Jacob a second time. <a href="../gen/35.html#10">35:10</a> 

<p><li>Jacob names Bethel again. The first time <A href="../gen/28.html#19">28:19</A> the name didn't stick. 
<a href="../gen/35.html#15">35:15</a>

<p><li>Isaac lives to be 180. <a href="../gen/35.html#28">35:28</a>

<p><li>Chapter 36 presents another boring genealogy that we are told to avoid in 
<A href="../1tim/1.html#4">1 Tim.1:4</A> and <A href="../tit/3.html#9">Tit.3:9</A> (&quot;Avoid foolish
questions and genealogies.&quot;) <a href="../gen/36.html#1">36:1-43</a>

<p><li>Amalek was born many years after his descendants were &quot;smitten.&quot; (<A href="../gen/14.html#7">Gen.14:7</A>)
<a href="../gen/36.html#12">36:12</a>

<p><li>"He rent his clothes." <a href="../gen/37.html#29">37:29</a>

<p><li> "And Jacob rent his clothes." <a href="../gen/37.html#34">37:34</a>

<p><li>Tamar (the widow of Er and Onan, who were killed by God) dresses up as a
prostitute and Judah (her father-in-law) propositions her, saying: "Let me come in unto thee ....
And he ... came in unto her, and she conceived by him." From this incestuous union, twins
(<a href="../gen/38.html#27">38:27-28</a>) were born (both were boys of course). One of these was Pharez -- an ancestor of
Jesus (<a href="../lk/3.html#33">Lk.3:33</a>). <a href="../gen/38.html#13">38:13-18</a>

<p><li>There was a seven year, God-created famine over the entire earth. <a href="../gen/41.html#56">41:56</a>

<p><li>"All countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn."<br>
The Aztecs, the Chinese, and the Indigenous Australians all came to Joseph to buy grain. <a href="../gen/41.html#57">41:57</a>

<p><li>"And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him."<br>
  Stupid stories like this can only be found in the Bible (<a href="../quran/12/index.htm#58">and the Quran</a>). <a href="../gen/42.html#8">42:8</a>

<p><li>Joseph and his magic divining cup. <a href="../gen/44.html#5">44:5</a>, <a href="../gen/44.html#15">15</a>

<p><li>Jacob lives to be 147. <a href="../gen/47.html#28">47:28</a>

<p><li>"He washed his garments in wine ... His eyes shall be red with wine."<br>
    Did Judah really wash his clothes in wine? Were his eyes bloodshot from drinking too much? Or is this a prophecy of Jesus? 
    (I didn't know Jesus had a drinking problem.) <a href="../gen/49.html#11">49:11-12</a>
    

<p><b><a href="../ex/abs_list.html">Exodus</a></b>

<p><li>The Israelite population went from 70 (or 75) to several million in a few hundred years. <a href="../ex/1.html#5">1:5,7</a>, 
<a href="../ex/12.html#37">12:37</a>, <a href="../ex/38.html#26">38:26</A>

<p><li>The birth story of Moses is suspiciously similar to that of the birth of Sargon, an 
    Akkadian monarch from the 3rd millennium BCE.
     (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/history/moses_3.shtml">BBC: The tale of the 
    basket</a>) <a href="../ex/2.html#3">2:3</a>
    
<p><li>God, disguised as a burning bush, has a long heart-to-heart talk with Moses. <a href="../ex/3.html#4">3:4 - 4:17</a>

<p><li>God shows Moses some tricks that he says are sure to impress. First, throw your rod on the 
ground; it will become a snake. Then grab the snake by the tail and it will become a rod again. Next, 
make your hand appear leprous, and then cure it. And finally, pour water on the 
ground and it will turn into blood. (That ought to do it!) <a href="../ex/4.html#2">4:2-9</a>

<p><li>God decides to kill Moses because his son had not yet been circumcised. Luckily for
Moses, his Egyptian wife Zipporah "took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son,
and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me. So he [God] let him
go." This story shows the importance of penises to God, and his hatred of foreskins. 
<a href="../ex/4.html#24">4:24-26</a>

<p><li>Moses and Aaron ask the Pharaoh to let all the Israelites go into the desert to pray for three days, or else God 
will kill them all "with pestilence, or with the sword." <a href="../ex/5.html#3">5:3</a>

<p><li>God says that Abraham didn't know that his name was Jehovah. Yet in <a href="../gen/22.html#14">Gen.22:14</a> Abraham names the 
place where he nearly kills Isaac after God's name, Jehovah. <a href="../ex/6.html#3">6:3</a>

<p><li>Lehi, Kohath, and Amram join the long 
list of biblical characters with ridiculously long lives (137, 133, and 137 years, respectively). 
<a href="../ex/6.html#16">6:16, 18, 20</a>

<p><li>In complaining about his difficulty with public speaking, Moses says, 
&quot;Behold I am of uncircumcised lips.&quot;&nbsp; <a href="../ex/6.html#12">6:12</a>, <a href="../ex/6.html#30">6:30</a>

<p><li>God tells Moses and Aaron that when Pharaoh asks for a miracle just throw your rod down and it will become a serpent.
So when the time comes, Moses throws down his rod and it becomes a serpent. But the Egyptian magicians duplicate this trick.
Luckily, for Aaron, his snake swallows theirs. (Whew!) <a href="../ex/7.html#9">7:9-13</a>

<p><li>After the rod to serpent trick, God tells Moses and Aaron to smite the river and turn it into blood. This is the first of the
famous 10 plagues of Egypt. Unfortunately, the magicians know this trick too, and they do so with their enchantments. Shucks!
Just how the river could be turned to blood by the Egyptian sorcerers after it had been turned to blood by Moses and Aaron is not
explained. <a href="../ex/7.html#17">7:17-24</a>

<p><li>The second plague is frogs. Frogs covered the land. They were all over the beds and filled the ovens. But the Egyptian
magicians did this trick too. (Did they wait until the frogs cleared out from the last performance before doing it again?) After the
frog making contest was declared a draw, all the frogs died and "they gathered them together upon heaps; and the land stank." I
bet. But at least it was all for the greater glory of God. <a href="../ex/8.html#2">8:2-7</a>

<p><li>Plague #3 is lice in man and beast. This is the first trick that the magicians couldn't do. After this the magicians were
convinced that Moses and Aaron's plagues were done by "the finger of God," and they gave up trying to match the remaining
seven plagues. I guess lice are harder to make than frogs. <a href="../ex/8.html#17">8:17-19</a>

<p><li>The fourth plague is swarms of flies, continuing the frogs and lice theme. <a href="../ex/8.html#21">8:21</a>

<p><li>The fifth plague: all cattle in Egypt die. <a href="../ex/9.html#6">9:6</a><br> But a 
little later (<A href="../ex/9.html#19">9:19-20</A>, <a href="../ex/12.html#29">12:29</a>), God 
kills them again a couple more times.

<p><li>The sixth plague: boils and blains upon man and beast.<a href="../ex/9.html#9">9:9-12</a>

<p><li>Why does God send plagues? So that people can get to know him better. <a href="../ex/9.html#14">9:14</a>

<p><li>God gave power to the Pharaoh so that he could show off his own power by killing him. <a href="../ex/9.html#15">9:15-16</a>

<p><li>The seventh plague is hail. "And the hail smote throughout the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and
beast." <a href="../ex/9.html#22">9:22-25</a>

<p><li>God killed Egyptians and their livestock by smashing them with huge hailstones mixed with fire. <a href="../ex/9.html#24">9:24</a>

<p><li>God wants to be remembered forever for the mass murder of little children. <a href="#10.html#2">10:2</a>

<p><li>Eighth plague: locusts that are so thick that they "covered the face of the whole earth." (Even over Antarctica?) 
<a href="../ex/10.html#4">10:4-5</a>

<p><li>Ninth plague: three days of darkness. The darkness was so this that the Egyptians couldn't even see each other. But the
darkness knew how to avoid the Israelites, and so "all the children of Israel had light 
in their dwellings." <a href="../ex/10.html#21">10:21-23</a>

<p><li>God tells the Israelites to smear some blood on their doors. That way when he's going around killing Egyptian
children, he'll remember not to kill their children too. He probably said to himself when he saw the blood, "Oh yeah, I
remember now. I not supposed to kill the children in this house." <a href="../ex/12.html#7">12:7, 13</a>

<p><li>"And the pillar of the cloud went from before their face,
    and stood behind them." <a href="../ex/14.html#19">14:19</a>
    
<p><li>"It was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these."<br>
God's special cloud was a cloud of darkness to the Egyptians, but a cloud of light to the Hebrews.  <a href="../ex/14.html#20">14:20</a>    

<p><li>God travels in a cloud by day and a fire by night. <a href="../ex/13.html#21">13:21</a>

<p><li>The Egyptians chased after the Israelites with "all Pharaoh's horses." But according to <a href="../ex/9.html#3">9:3-6</a> there wouldn't 
have been any horses, since God killed them all in "a very grievous murrain." <a href="../ex/14.html#23">14:23</a>

<p><li>"The Lord ... took off their chariot wheels."<br>
God (the devious mechanic) personally removed the wheels from the Egyptian chariots. <a href="../ex/14.html#25">14:25</a> 

<p><li>God divided the sea with a "blast of [his] nostrils." <a href="../ex/15.html#8">15:8</a>

<p><li>Moses casts a tree into the water and makes the bitter water taste sweet. <a href="../ex/15.html#25">15:25</a>

<p><li>God appears to the Israelites and speaks from a cloud promising to send lots of food (quails and mana) from the sky. 
<a href="../ex/16.html#10">16:10-12</a>

<p><li>It took the Israelites 40 years to travel from Egypt to Canaan, yet such a journey, even at that time, 
would have taken no more than ten days. <a href="../ex/16.html#35">16:35</a>

<p><li>God stands on a rock and tells Moses to hit the rock. Then water comes out of it for the people 
to drink. God's such a clever guy! <a href="../ex/17.html#6">17:6</a>

<p><li>As long as Moses the magician keeps his hand up, the Israelites are successful in battle, but the second his hand falls,
they start getting beat. So when Moses' arm gets tired, Aaron props it up so that the Amalekites get slaughtered. 
<a href="../ex/17.html#11">17:11-12</a>

<p><li>"The Lord has sworn [God swears!] that the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation." So God
is still fighting Amalek. I hope Moses can still keep his hand up. <a href="../ex/17.html#14">17:14-16</a>

"They shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they come in unto the tabernacle ... or ... die." <a href="../ex/28.html#43">28:43</a>

<p><li>God instructs the priests to burn the dung of bullocks outside the camp as a sin offering. <a href="../ex/29.html#14">29:14</a>
<p><li>God tells Moses to kill a ram and put the blood on the tip of Aaron's right ear, and on his right thumb, and on his right

will make them "hallowed." <a href="../ex/29.html#20">29:20-21</a>

<p><li>God tells Aaron and his sons to take the rump, fat, caul, kidneys, and right shoulder of the ram and add a loaf of bread
or two, and a wafer of unleavened bread. Then they put the whole mess in the hands of Aaron and his sons and they wave them
before the Lord. This is a wave offering. <a href="../ex/29.html#22">29:22-24</a>

<p><b><a href="../lev/abs_list.html">Leviticus</a></b>

<p><li>God gives detailed instructions for performing ritualistic animal sacrifices. such bloody rituals
must be important to God, judging from the number of times that he repeats their instructions.
Indeed the entire first nine chapters of Leviticus can be summarized as follows: Get an animal,
kill it, sprinkle the blood around, cut the dead animal into pieces, and burn it for a "sweet savor
unto the Lord."  <a href="../lev/1.html#1">Chapters 1 - 9</a>

<p><li>"For a sweet savour unto the Lord." <a href="../lev/1.html#17">1:17</a>, <a href="../lev/2.html#2">2:2</a>,

<p><li>"It is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire." <a href="../lev/2.html#10">2:10</a>

<p><li>"The fat that covereth the inwards ... and the two kidneys ... and the caul above the liver.... It is ... a sweet savour unto the Lord." 
<a href="../lev/3.html#3">3:3-5</a>

<p><li>"The fat ... the whole rump ... the inwards ... the two kidneys ... burn it upon the altar: 
it is the food of the offering made by fire unto the LORD." <a href="../lev/3.html#9">3:9-11</a>

<p><li>When you are making your animal sacrifices, be sure to remember that "all the fat is the
Lord's." God loves blood and guts, but most especially fat. And he doesn't like to share! 
 <a href="../lev/3.html#16">3:16</a>
 
<p><li>"If a soul shall sin through ignorance...." But how can someone "sin through
ignorance?" Don't your have to at least know that an act is wrong before it can be sinful? 
 <a href="../lev/4.html#2">4:2</a>, <a href="../lev/4.html#13">13</a>, <a href="../lev/4.html#22">22</a>,

<p><li>"When a ruler hath sinned ... through ignorance" <a href="../lev/4.html#22">4:22</a>

<p><li>"If any one of the common people sin through ignorance ... then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, 
a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned."<br>
If a common person sins through ignorance, then kill a female goat. (More important people must kill male goats.) <a href="../lev/4.html#27">4:27-28</a>

or the carcase of unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty."<br>
If you touch any unclean thing (like a dead cow or a bug), then you'll be both unclean and guilty.   <a href="../lev/5.html#2">5:2</a>

If you swear to do something evil or good, you'll be guilty. <a href="../lev/5.html#4">5:4</a>

<p><li>"He shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD ... a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats."<br>
If you touch an insect, dead animal, or "the uncleanness of man" or if you swear to do something good or bad (5:2-4), kill a female lamb or goat for God. (A female
 will do since it's a minor offense.) <a href="../lev/5.html#6">5:6</a>
 
 <p><li>"The Lord spake unto Moses, saying, If a soul ... sin through ignorance ... then he shall bring for his trespass unto the LORD 
a ram without blemish."<br>
If you sin without knowing that you've done anything wrong, kill an unblemished ram for God. <a href="../lev/5.html#14">5:14-15</a>

<p><li>"If a soul sin ... though he wist it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity."<br>
If you sin against your own will, you are still guilty. <a href="../lev/5.html#17">5:17</a>

<p><li>"Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy."<br>
Whatever touches the dead body of a burnt offering is holy.  
 <a href="../lev/6.html#27">6:27</a>
 
 <p><li>"Offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them ... and the caul that is above the liver." 
<a href="../lev/7.html#3">7:3</a>

<p><li>"The priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering."<br>
The priest gets all the skin to himself. Lucky!  <a href="../lev/7.html#8">7:8</a>

<p><li>"And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the fryingpan, 
and in the pan, shall be the priest's that offereth it."<br>

<p><li>"The flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; 
he shall not leave any of it until the morning."<br>

<p><li>"If any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day ... 
it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity."<br>
Don't eat any of your dead sacrifcial animals on the third day after you kill them. That is an abomination to God and he will 
never forgive you for it!   <a href="../lev/7.html#18">7:18</a>

<p><li>"And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten."<br>
Don't eat any of your dead sacrficed animals if they have touched any unclean thing. <a href="../lev/7.html#19">7:19</a>

<p><li>"But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings ... having his uncleanness upon him, 
even that soul shall be cut off from his people."<br>
Don't eat any sacrificed animals while you have your uncleanness upon you. If you do, you'll be exiled. <a href="../lev/7.html#20">7:20</a>

<p><li> "Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable 
unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off 
from his people."<br>
If you touch any unclean thing (like "the uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any other abominable unclean thing") 
while eating sacrifieced animals, you will be exiled.  <a href="../lev/7.html#21">7:21</a>

<p><li>"Ye shall eat no manner of fat ... for whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the 
LORD ... shall be cut off from his people."<br>

<p><li>"Moses brought Aaron and ... he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod." <a href="../lev/8.html#6">8:6-7</a>

<p><li>"The Urim and Thummim"<br>
The Urim and Thummim were like the two sides of a magic coin that could be flipped to to give a yes or no answer to any question. 
They were also what Joseph Smith used to translate the Book of Mormon. <a href="../lev/8.html#8">8:8</a>
 
<p><li>Moses does it all for God. First he kills an animal; wipes the blood on Aaron's ears,
thumbs, and big toes. Then he sprinkles blood round about and waves the guts before the Lord.
Finally he burns the whole mess for "a sweet savour before the Lord." 
 <a href="../lev/8.html#14">8:14-32</a>
 
<p><li>"Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger .. and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar." 
 <a href="../lev/8.html#15">8:15</a>
 
 <p><li>"And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned it upon the altar."

<p><li>God commands the Israelites to keep doing these wave and heave offerings "by a statute
forever."  <a href="../lev/10.html#15">10:15</a>

<p><li>Clams, oysters, crabs, lobsters, and shrimp are abominations to God. 
 <a href="../lev/11.html#10">11:10-12</a>

<a href="../lev/11.html#19">19</a>
 
 <p><li>Four-legged fowls are abominations. <a href="../lev/11.html#20">11:20</a>
 
<p><li>Be sure to watch out for those "other flying creeping things which have four feet." (I wish
God wouldn't get so technical!) I guess he must mean four-legged insects. You'd think that since
God made the insects, and so many of them (at least several million species), that he would know
how many legs they have!  <a href="../lev/11.html#23">11:23</a>

<p><li>Don't touch any dead creeping things. <a href="../lev/11.html#31">11:31</a>

<p><li>"She shall be unclean."<br>
Women are dirty and sinful after childbirth, so God prescribes rituals for their purification. 
(And baby girls make them twice as sinful and dirty as baby boys do.)   <a href="../lev/12.html#1">12:1-5</a>

<p><li>"If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days ... And she shall then

girls are twice as dirty as boys. <a href="../lev/12.html#5">12:5</a>

<p><li>"She shall bring a lamb ... for a burnt offering, and... a young pigeon, or dove, for a sin offering."<br>

<p><li>God's law for lepers: Get two birds. Kill one. Dip the live bird in the blood of the

Next find a lamb and kill it. Wipe some of its blood on the patient's right ear, thumb, and big toe.
Sprinkle seven times with oil and wipe some of the oil on his right ear, thumb and big toe.

<p><li>What to do if you eat some holy thing unwittingly. Important stuff that you need to know about. <a href="../lev/22.html#14">22:14</a>

<p><li>God gives us more instructions on killing and burning animals. I guess the first nine
chapters of Leviticus wasn't enough. He says we must do this because he really likes the smell
-- it is "a sweet savour unto the Lord." <a href="../lev/23.html#12">23:12-14, 18</a>

<p><li>"Ye shall offer ... a male without blemish ... Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye
    shall not offer these unto the LORD ... Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or crushed, or
    broken, or cut."<br>
God wants us to kill lots of animals for him. Not just any animals, though. God only wants dead, male animals without any blemishes. Don't 
kill any blind , broken, maimed, or scabbed animials for him. It will just get him pissed off. (And, since you've been reading Leviticus, you 
know what God does when he's pissed off.) <a href="../lev/22.html#19">22:19-24</a>

<p><li>God won't accept animal sacrifices from strangers, since strangers have blemishes and are corrupt. <a href="../lev/22.html#19">22:25</a>

<p><li>Don't kill animals for God until they are at least eight days old. And don't kill mother and her young on the same day. You can kill the 
    mom on one day and her young on the next. <a href="../lev/22.html#27">22:27-28</a>

<p><li>God describes the torments that he has planned for those who displease him. The usual
stuff: plagues, burning fevers that will consume the eyes, etc. but he reserves the worst for the
little children. He says "ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it," "I will send
wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children," and "ye shall eat the flesh of your
sons and daughters." But if you humble your uncircumcised heart, God won't do all these 
nasty things to you. It's your choice.  <a href="../lev/26.html#16">26:16-41</a>

<p><li>"And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins."

<p><li>The Law of Jealousies. If a man suspects his wife of being unfaithful, he reports it to the priest. The priest then
makes her drink some "bitter water." If she is guilty, the water makes her thigh rot and her belly swell. If innocent, no harm
done -- the woman is free and will "conceive seed." In any case, "the man shall be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman shall
bear her iniquity."  <a href="../num/5.html#11">5:11-31</a>

<p><li>"And the spirit of  jealousy come upon him ... and she be defiled:

<p><li>When the tabernacle was set up, it was covered by a cloud during the day and by fire all night. <a href="../num/9.html#15">9:15</a>

<p><li>God led the Israelites from one camp to the other with a cloud. When the cloud stopped and rested someplace, the Israelites pitched their

burned the complainers alive. That'll teach them.  <a href="../num/11.html#1">11:1</a>

<p><li>The people begin to whine about not having any meat. So God says he'll 
give them meat, alright. He'll give them "flesh to eat," not for just a few days, but "for a whole 
month, until it come out of [their] nostrils, and it be loathsome to [them]." Yuck.

nostrils, and it be loathsome to you." Yuck.  <a href="../num/11.html#20">11:20</a>

<p><li>God sends quails to feed his people until they were "two cubits [about a meter] high upon the face of the earth." Taking
the "face of the earth" to be a circle with a radius of say 30 kilometers (an approximate day's journey), this would amount to 3
trillion (3x10<sup>12</sup>) liters of quails. At 2 quails per liter, this would provide a couple million quails for each of several million
people.  <a href="../num/11.html#31">11:31</a>

<p><li>"Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth." This is a strange way
to describe on of the cruelest men to have ever lived (If he ever did live, which he probably didn't). Moses, as he is described
in the Bible, is anything but meek (See <a href="../num/31.html#14">Num.31:14-18</a> for an example of his "meekness").

<p><li>"They ... cut down ... a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff."<br>
A single cluster of grapes was so heavy that it took two men to carry it. I guess that's what you'd expect, though, 
since they were in the land of giants. (See verses <a href="../num/13.html#32">32-33</a>.) <a href="../num/13.html#23">13:23</a>

<p><li>&quot;And there we saw the giants
... And we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their
sight.&quot; This statement may have been figurative, hyperbole, typical biblical 
exaggeration, or an actual description of the sons of Anak, in which case they must have been
about 100 meters tall.  These are the same giants (the Nephilium) that resulted 
when the &quot;sons of God&quot; mated with &quot;the daughters of men in 
<a href="../gen/6.html#4">Gen.6:4</a> Of course, these superhuman god-men should have been 
destroyed in the flood. So what are they doing still alive?  <a href="../num/13.html#33">13:33</a>

<p><li>"Joshua ... and Caleb ... rent their clothes." <a href="../num/14.html#6">14:6</a>

<p><li>"All the congregation bade stone them with stones."<br>
    The people have had enough of wandering around in the desert and they don't much want to fight giants (see <a href="../num/13.html#33">13:33</a>), 
    so they decide to stone Joshua and his merry men (with stones). <a href="../num/14.html#10">14:10a</a>
    
<p>"The glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children  of Israel."<br>
    But before the people get started with the stoning, God shows up in all his glory. <a href="../num/14.html#10">14:10b</a>
    
    <p><li>God tells Moses that he is going to kill all of the Israelites -- every last whining one of the them, and then 
make a whole bunch of brand new Israelites. <a href="../num/14.html#12">14:12</a>

<p><li>Moses tries to talk God out of killing everyone by telling him that the Egyptians will hear about it and will say that 
he wasn't able to lead the Israelites to Israel, so he killed them all instead. <a href="../num/14.html#13">14:13-19</a>

<p><li>Thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night." 
<a href="../num/14.html#14">14:14</a>

<p><li>It took the Israelites 40 years to travel from Egypt to Canaan, yet such a journey, even at that time, 
would have taken no more than a few weeks. <a href="../num/14.html#33">14:33</a>, <a href="../num/32.html#13">32:13</a>

<p><li>God gives more instructions for the ritualistic killing of animals. The smell of burning flesh is "a sweet savour
unto the Lord."  <a href="../num/15.html#3">15:3</a>, <a href="../num/15.html#13">13-14</a>, <a href="../num/15.html#24">24</a> 

<p><li>"If any soul sin through ignorance ..." but how can someone sin through ignorance? Don't you have to know that an
action is wrong for it to be sinful? Oh well, if you do happen to sin through ignorance, you can be forgiven by God if you kill
some animals. <a href="../num/15.html#27">15:27-30</a>

<p><li>Immediately after ordering the execution of the sabbath breaker, God gets down to some more important business
-- like instructing the people on how to make fringes on their garments.  <a href="../num/15.html#38">15:38-39</a>

<p><li>"And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face." <a href="../num/16.html#4">16:4</a>

<p><li>"The glory of the LORD appeared unto all the congregation." <a href="../num/16.html#19">16:19</a>

<p><li>"And they fell upon their faces." <a href="../num/16.html#22">16:22</a>

<p><li>After burning the the 250 guys that offered incense, God tells Moses to keep their censers (because they are holy) to remind everyone 
  not to offer incense without a license. <a href="../num/16.html#36">16:36-40</a>
  
<p><li>"Behold ... the glory of the Lord appeared." <a href="../num/16.html#42">16:42</a>

<p><li>"And they fell upon their faces." <a href="../num/16.html#45">16:45</a>

<p><li>"Take a censer ... and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them."<br>
    Moses tells Aaron to burn some incense to make God quit killing people. (God just killed 250 for burning incense.) 
    <a href="../num/16.html#45">16:45</a>

<p><li>Aaron is getting better at his magic tricks. He has rod bud, bloom, and yield almonds.  
<a href="../num/17.html#8">17:8</a>

<p><li>"They shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die."<br>
Stay away from holy things and places -- like churches. God might have to kill you if you get too close. 
<a href="../num/18.html#3">18:3</a>

<p><li>God describes once again the procedure for ritualistic animal sacrifices. such rituals must be extremely important to
God, since he makes their performance a "statute" and "covenant" forever. Why, then don't Bible-believers perform these
sacrifices anymore? Don't they realize how God must miss the "sweet savour" of burning flesh? Don't they believe God when
he says "forever"?  <a href="../num/18.html#17">18:17-19</a>

<p><li>"Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die." 
<a href="../num/18.html#22">18:22</a>

<p><li>"Neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die." <a href="../num/18.html#32">18:32</a>

<p><li>"This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded."<br>
These absurd rituals, cruel sacrifices, and unjust punishments are vitally
important to God. They are to be "a perpetual statute" for everyone on earth. <a href="../num/19.html#1">19:1-22</a>

<p><li>The Red Heifer. Some fundamentalists believe 
that when a red heifer is born, Armageddon will soon follow. Well, a red heifer was born in March 2002 and has 
been declared ritually acceptable by the rabbis. So in a few years it can be sacrificed, ushering in, so they 
say, the end of the world. You can read all about it 
<a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/dreher/dreher041102.asp">here</a> in the National Review.

<p><li>"Take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle ... seven times."<br>
God's instructions for putting blood on fingers, sprinkling it around, and then burning the dung of sacrificial animals. 
This is something that everyone needs to know about. (That's why it's in the Bible!). <a href="../num/19.html#4">19:4-5</a>

<p><li>"Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe ... and shall be unclean until the even." (The guy who burns 
the dung also has to take a bath, which sounds like a pretty good idea to me.)  <a href="../num/19.html#7">19:7-8</a>

<p><li>"And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer ... and it shall be kept ... for a water of separation: 
it is a purification for sin."<br>
After you kill and burn the dung of the red heifer have a clean guy gather the ashes and then be sure to keep them for 
"a water of separation: it is a purification for sin."  <a href="../num/19.html#9">19:9</a>

<p><li>"He that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even; and it shall be ...

<p><li>He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days." (Bad news for understakers.)  
<a href="../num/19.html#11">19:11</a>

<p><li>He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: 
but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean."
(Use the "water of separation" made from the ashes of the dung of the red heifer. See <a href="../num/19.html#9">19:9</a>.)  
<a href="../num/19.html#12">19:12</a>

<p><li>"Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself ... shall be cut off from Israel:

<p><li>God asks Balaam the non-rhetorical question, "What men are these with thee?" <a href="../num/22.html#9">22:9</a>
<p><li>God says to Balaam, "If men come to call thee, rise up, and go with them." Men come, and Balaam goes with them,
just as cog had commanded." And God's anger was kindled because he went" -- but he was just following God's instructions! 
 <a href="../num/22.html#20">22:20-22</a>
 
<p><li>Balaam has a nice little chat with his ass.  <a href="../num/22.html#28">22:28-30</a>

<p><li>"Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD
    standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he ... fell flat on his face." <a href="../num/22.html#31">22:31</a>
    
<p><li>God meets Balaam and "put a word in his mouth."  <a href="../num/23.html#15">23:15-16</a>
<p><li>God has "the strength of a unicorn." Oh heck, I bet he's even stronger than a unicorn.  <a href="../num/23.html#22">23:22</a>
<p><li>Balaam says "his king shall be higher than Agag." But Balaam couldn't have known about Agag since Agag didn't live
until the time of King Saul. (See <a href="../1sam/15.html#33">1Sam.15:33</a> where Samuel hacks king Agag into pieces.)  
<a href="../num/24.html#7">24:7</a>

<a href="../num/32.html#13">32:13</a>

<p><li>If a person accidentally kills someone, then she should go to a city of refuge. If she can get to the city of refuge before the 
"revenger of blood" (the victim's closest relative) can catch her, then she is safe, at least until the high priest dies 
(I don't know what he has to do with it). But if she is caught outside the city of refuge, then the revenger of blood can kill her.  
<a href="../num/35.html#11">35:11-12</a>

<p><li>"If he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death."

<p><li>"If he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death." 
<a href="../num/35.html#17">35:17</a>

<p><li>"Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death." 
<a href="../num/35.html#18">35:18</a>

<p><li>"But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge ... and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood. Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest"
If the accidental killer leaves the city of refuge and is caught by the revenger of blood, then the revenger can legally kill the accidental killer.

<p><li>After God instructs the Israelites to mercilessly slaughter all the strangers that they encounter

the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt."  <a href="../dt/10.html#19">10:19</a>

<p><li>God says that we shouldn't add to, or take away from, any of his commands. Why then don't modern

<p><li>This verse mistakenly says that the hare chews its cud. <a href="../dt/14.html#7">14:7-8</a>

be eaten.  <a href="../dt/14.html#10">14:10</a>

<p><li>To the biblical God, a bat is just an another unclean bird.  <a href="../dt/14.html#11">14:11, 18</a>

<p><li> Don't eat any dead animals that you find lying around. But it's okay to give it to strangers or sell it to foreigners. And don't boil a kid

 <a href="../jos/6.html#18">6:18-19</a>
 
<p><li>Joshua and all the elders tear their clothes, fall on their faces, and put dust on their heads. They perform this tantrum

burning flesh sign from <a href="#20">6:20-21</a> didn't satisfy him.) 
So he puts down some wool on the
ground and asks God to make it wet, while keeping the surrounding ground dry. And God does it, no sweat. But
Gideon is still not sure he can trust God, so he asks him to reverse the trick, and make the ground wet and the wool
dry. "And God did so ..." Gideon must have been impressed by a God that could do such great things. 
 <a href="../jg/6.html#36">6:36-40</a>
 
 <p><li> "The people that are with thee are too many."<br>
God tells Gideon to reduce the size of his army so that they couldn't claim to have killed all the Midianites without him. 
God doesn't like to share credit for his killings. <a href="../jg/7.html#2">7:2</a>
 
<p><li>God picks the men to fight in Gideon's army by the way they drink water. Only those that lap water with their
tongues, "as a dog lappeth," shall fight.  <a href="../jg/7.html#4">7:4-7</a>

<p><li>"And the LORD said unto Gideon, 
  By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you." <a href="../jg/7.html#7">7:7</a>

<p><li> The Midianites and Amalekites had an infinite number of camels -- well, maybe not quite, but at least as many
"as the sand by the sea shore."  <a href="../jg/7.html#12">7:12</a>

<p><li>Some guy had a dream about barley cakes and tents. The barley cake smote the tent and -- well, anyway, it was a sign from 
God that he and Gideon would massacre the Midianites. <a href="../jg/7.html#13">7:13-14</a>

<p><li>Gideon's men break three hundred pitchers while holding lamps, blowing trumpets, and yelling "The sword of the Lord and of 
    Gideon." <a href="../jg/7.html#16">7:16-20</a>

<p><li>"Gideon made an ephod ... and all Israel went thither a whoring after it." <a href="../jg/8.html#27">8:27</a>

<p><li>Abimelech kills 69 brothers "upon one stone." (He was trying to get in the Guinness Book of World Records.) 
 <a href="../jg/9.html#5">9:5</a>
 
<p><li>And now for something completely different: Talking Trees <a href="../jg/9.html#8">9:8-15</a>

<p><li>"Wine ... cheereth God and man." So God drinks wine and it makes him happy.  <a href="../jg/9.html#13">9:13</a>

<p><li>God sends evil spirits that cause humans to deal treacherously with each other.  <a href="../jg/9.html#23">9:23-24</a>

<p><li> Abimelech and his men burned to death 1000 men and women who were trapped in a tower.
(They had really big towers back then.) <a href="../jg/9.html#49">9:49</a>

<p><li>"Jair ... had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities."
 <a href="../jg/10.html#3">10:3-4</a>
 
<p><li>God was angry at Israel so he sold them to the Philistines. (He had previously sold them to the kings of
Mesopotamia (<a href="../jg/3.html#8">3:8</a>) and Canaan (<a href="../jg/4.html#2">4:2</a>).) 
<a href="../jg/10.html#7">10:7</a>

<p><li>"And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD." <a href="../jg/10.html#10">10:10</a>

<p><li>"And the LORD said unto the children of Israel ... I will deliver you no more ... Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen." 
<a href="../jg/10.html#11">10:11-14</a>

<p><li>"And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned ... And they put away the strange gods from among them, 
and served the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel." <a href="../jg/10.html#15">10:15-16</a>

<p><li>"He rent his clothes." <a href="../jg/11.html#35">11:35</a>

<p><li>42,000 Ephraimites fail the "shibboleth" test and are killed by Jephthah's army. <a href="../jg/12.html#6">12:6</a>

<p><li>"Ibzan ... had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters." <a href="../jg/12.html#8">12:8-9</a>

<p><li>Abdon had 70 sons and nephews that rode on 70 ass colts. <a href="../jg/12.html#13">12:13-14</a>

<p><li>"The children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; 
    and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years." <a href="../jg/13.html#1">13:1</a>
    
<p><li>"And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, 
Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son."  <a href="../jg/13.html#2">13:2-3</a> 

<p><li>"The child shall be a Nazarite from the womb."<br>
    According to <a href="../num/6.html#6">Numbers 6:6</a> Nazarites are not to touch any dead bodies. But Samson was a mass murderer. 
    He must have touched hundreds of dead bodies. (Or did he just kill his victims, being careful not to touch them after they were dead?) 
    <a href="../jg/13.html#5">13:5</a>

<p><li>A man of God came unto me [Samson's mom]."<br>
She didn't ask him any questions and he didn't tell her his name. <a href="../jg/13.html#6">13:6</a>

<p><li>"The angel of God came again unto the woman 
     as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her." <br>
     Husbands are never around when angels come unto women and make them pregnant. <a href="../jg/13.html#9">13:9</a>

<p><li>"Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret?"<br>
The angel had a secret name. (Clarence?, 007?, agent 99?)  <a href="../jg/13.html#18">13:18</a>

<p><li>"The angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And
    Manoah and his wife ... fell on their faces." <a href="../jg/13.html#20">13:20</a>
    
    <p><li>"But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife.
    Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD."<br>
    Manoah and his wife knew the angel was from God because they never saw him again. <a href="../jg/13.html#21">13:21</a>

<p><li>"And the child [Samson] grew, and the Lord blessed him." Samson was one of the vilest of all the vile Bible
heroes; Yet he was especially blessed by God.  <a href="../jg/13.html#24">13:24</a>

<p><li>Samson's lust for the Philistine woman was "of the Lord." It was all a part of God's plan for killing Philistines.  
<a href="../jg/14.html#4">14:4</a>

<p><li>Samson rips up a young lion when "the spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him." Later, when going to "take"
his Philistine wife he notices a swarm of bees and honey in the lion's carcass (a Divine miracle -- or just rotting flesh, flies, 
and maggots?).  <a href="../jg/14.html#5">14:5-8</a>

<p><li>"I will now put forth a riddle unto you ... Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness."<br>
That's the riddle. Whoever can figure it out before the week of partying is over will get 30 sheets and 30 garments. 
But whoever can't will have to give Samuel 30 sheets and 30 garments. <a href="../jg/14.html#12">14:12-13</a>

<p><li>"Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire."
Samson's party buddies are taking the riddle seriously. They tell Samson's new Philistine wife to tell them the answer to 
the riddle or they'll burn her house down. <a href="../jg/14.html#15">14:15</a>

<p><li>"And she wept before him the seven days ... and ... on the seventh day ... he told her ... and she told the riddle to ... her people." 
<a href="../jg/14.html#17">14:17</a>

<p><li>Samson catches 300 foxes, ties their tails together, and sets them on fire. 
<a href="../jg/15.html#4">15:4</a>

<p><li>"The spirit of the Lord came mightily upon" Samson and "he found a new jawbone of an ass ... and took it,
and slew 1000 men therewith."  <a href="../jg/15.html#14">15:14-15</a>

<p><li>After Samson killed 1000 men with the jawbone of an ass, he was thirsty. So God 
    created and filled a hollow in the very same jawbone and put water in it for Samson to drink. 
    <a href="../jg/15.html#17">15:17-19</a>
    
<p><li>Samson, after "going in unto" a harlot, takes the doors, gate, and posts of the city and carries them to the top of a
hill. Why did he do this? Did God make him do it or was he just showing off? The Bible doesn't say. 
 <a href="../jg/16.html#3">16:3</a>
 
 <p><li>Delilah is paid by the Philistines to find out the magical source of Samson's strength and how he could be restrained. 
 She asks Samson three times. He says he'd become as week as any other man if he were tied up with bowstrings. 
 So she does that, but he breaks the bow strings. She askes again and he says to use ropes. So she uses ropes, but he breaks the ropes. 
 Next he says to weave his braids into a cloth. So she does that, but he breaks out of that one too. <a href="../jg/6.html#6">6:6-14</a>
 
<p><li>Samson reveals the secret of his strength to Delilah: "If I be shaven, then my strength will go from me." (And I
thought his strength was from God.)  <a href="../jg/16.html#17">16:17</a>

<p><li>After taking in a traveling Levite, the host offers his virgin daughter and his guest's concubine to a mob of
perverts (who want to have sex with his guest). The mob refuses the daughter, but accepts the concubine and they
"abuse her all night." The next morning she crawls back to the doorstep and dies. The Levite puts her dead body on an
ass and takes her home. Then he chops her body up into twelve pieces and sends them to each of the twelve tribes of
Israel.  <a href="../jg/19.html#22">19:22-30</a>

<p><li>"The children of Israel ... gathered together as one man [along with] four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword."<br>
After receiving the Levite's rotting-concubine-body-part-message (see the last chapter for the gory details), 
the entire population of Israel along with 400,000 soldiers gathered together to decide what to do about it.  
<a href="../jg/20.html#1">20:1</a>

<p><li>"I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country."<br>
    The Levite tells everyone his story (leaving out the part about how <a href="../jg/19.html#25">he <i>gave</i> his concubine to the 
    mob</a> to do with as they pleased), explaining the mysterious rotting body part messages that brought everyone in Israel together.  
    <a href="../jg/20.html#4">20:4-6</a>
    
<p><li>"And all the people arose as one man, saying...."<br>
Can't you just picture it? After hearing the Levite's story, the entire population of Israel spoke in unison, saying "We will not any of us go to his tent, 
neither will we any of us turn into his house."   <a href="../jg/20.html#8">20:8</a>   

<p><li>The Benjamites had 700 left-handed men who could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.
<a href="../jg/20.html#16">20:16</a>

<p><li>After the Benjamites refuse to turn over the men from Gibeah (the town that wanted to have sex with the Levite 
but settled for his concubine instead), the Israelites asked God which tribe should go to war with them. God said the tribe 
of Judah should go first. So Judah goes to war, but the Benjamites with their sharp shooting lefties kill 22,000 Israelites. 
 <a href="../jg/20.html#18">20:18-21</a>
 
<p><li>After 22,000 Israelites were killed by the Benjamites, they cry all day before the Lord. Then they ask God (again) 
if they should go to war against Benjamin. God said yes, so they try it again, and another 18,000 Israelites are killed.  
<a href="../jg/20.html#23">20:23-25</a>

<p><li>Once again all of the Israelites sit and weep before God, and ask again (for the third time) if they should attack the 
Benjamites. God give them his usual answer: Attack. This time he promises (he was just kidding the last couple times) that 
he "will deliver them into thine hand." <a href="../jg/20.html#26">20:26-28</a>

<p><li>God tells Phinehas to fight against the Benjamites, saying he will deliver them into his hand. 
     So the Israelites kill some more people for God. <a href="../jg/20.html#38">20:38-41</a>
     
<p><li>After the Israelites heard the Levite's story (about chopping up his dead concubine and sending her body parts to each 
tribe of Israel) they vowed not to "give" their daughters to the Benjamites. So now they had a problem: they just finished 
killing all the Benjamite women and children (<a href="../jg/20.html#48">Jg 20:48</a>) so there were no women for the surviving Benjamite men to marry. 
[There were 600 Benjamite men that survived the war with the Israelites. (<a href="../jg/20.html#47">Jg 20:47</a>)]  
<a href="../jg/21.html#1">21:1-7</a>  

<p><li>But they find a great solution. They check their records and find that no one from Jabeshgilead came to the 
rotting-concubine- body-part meeting. So they'll go and steal their women and give them to the 600 surviving Benjamites.  
<a href="../jg/21.html#8">21:8</a>

<p><li>Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are 
destroyed out of Benjamin?" <a href="../jg/21.html#16">21:16</a>

<p><li>"We may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that 
giveth a wife to Benjamin." <a href="../jg/21.html#18">21:18</a>

<p><li>So they come up with another brilliant plan. Have the Benjamites hide in the bushes and then catch the daughters 
of Shiloh when they come out to dance. So that's what they did and everyone lived happily ever after.  <a href="../jg/21.html#19">21:19-23</a>

<p><li>"The Lord had shut up her [Hannah's] womb." <a href="../1sam/1.html#5">1:5</a>

<p><li>"And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the Lord remembered her." (He probably said something 
like, "Oh yeah, she's the one whose womb I shut up.") And Hannah conceived and "bare a son [Oh boy, 
another boy!], and called his name Samuel."  <a href="../1sam/1.html#19">1:19-20</a>

<p><li>"And the Lord visited Hannah [again], so that she conceived." Did he get her pregnant in the usual way? 
 <a href="../1sam/2.html#21">2:21</a>

<p><li>  A disembodied voice calls to the child Samuel three times. The first two times, Samuel thought it was 
  Eli that called him. But Eli figured that the voice must be God's. So the third time that 
  God called, he was able to deliver his message to Samuel. <a href="../1sam/3.html#4">3:4-10</a>
  
  <p><li>God will do something that will cause everyone's ears to tingle. <a href="../1sam/3.html#11">3:11</a>
  
  <p><li>Samuel tells Eli that God will punish his descendants forever (3:12-13) and Eli says, "Okay, whatever God wants 
is fine with me." <a href="../1sam/3.html#18">3:18</a>

<p><li>When the Israelites saw the ark of the covenant, they shouted so loud that the ground shook. <a href="../1sam/4.html#5">4:5</a>

<p><li>The Philistines set the ark of God next to the god Dagon, and the next morning Dagon had mysteriously (miraculously?) fallen on his face. The same 
thing happened the next night, only this time his head and hands were cut off, too! After that, no one ever entered the house of Dagon again. 
<a href="../1sam/5.html#2">5:2-5</a> 
  
<p><li>God smites the people of Ashdod with hemorrhoids "in their secret parts."  <a href="../1sam/5.html#6">5:6-12</a>

<p><li>To see if it was God who killed the Philistine people, the ark of the Lord and the five golden hemorrhoids were put into a cart pulled by 
two cows. Then the cows were let go. If the cows went directly to Bethshemesh, then God killed the people. And that is the way the cows went. 
So by this superstitious  method we know that it was God who killed the Philistines by giving them 
	hemorrhoids "in their secret parts." <a href="../1sam/6.html#7">6:7-12</a>

<p><li>After striking the Philistines with hemorrhoids "in their secret parts," he demands that they send him
five golden hemorrhoids as a "trespass offering."  <a href="../1sam/6.html#4">6:4-5, 11, 17</a>

<p><li>The LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them." 
<a href="../1sam/7.html#10">7:10-11</a>

<p><li>After God helped the Israelites slaughter the Philistines, Samuel erected a monument saying, "So far God has helped us." 
<a href="../1sam/7.html#12">7:12</a>

<p><li>Saul was the best looking guy in Israel and was a foot taller than everyone else.  
<a href="../1sam/9.html#2">9:2</a>

<p><li>God tells Samuel that Saul is the man he has chosen to be King. <a href="../1sam/9.html#17">9:17</a>

<p><li>Samuel found Saul's missing asses without even looking for them. You see, he's a seer -- just like Joseph Smith!  
<a href="../1sam/9.html#19">9:19-20</a>

<p><li>When the people couldn't find Saul (who was selected to be king by drawing lots), they "enquired 
of the Lord ... and the Lord answered, Behold he hath hid himself among the 
    stuff." <a href="../1sam/10.html#22">10:22</a>
    
<p><li>"But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they
    despised him, and brought no presents." <a href="../1sam/10.html#27">10:27</a>
    
<p><li>Everyone (except the virgin women) in Jabeshgilead was killed by the non-Benjamite Israelites (see Judges 21:10-14), 
yet here just a few years later "all the men" are negotiating a treaty with the Ammonites. 
Do dead men make treaties? I guess in the Bible they do! <a href="../1sam/11.html#1">11:1</a>
    
<p><li>"I make a covenant with your, that I may thrust out all your right eyes." Deals like this can only be found in the
Bible.  <a href="../1sam/11.html#2">11:2</a>

<p><li>"And the spirit of God came upon Saul ... and he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them
throughout all the coast of Israel." People do the darnedest
things when the spirit of God comes upon them!  <a href="../1sam/11.html#6">11:6-7</a>

<p><li>"Saul ... slew the Ammorites unto the heat of the day." Then he took a little break. After all, killing is
hard work.  <a href="../1sam/11.html#11">11:11</a>

<p><li>"So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain." <a href="../1sam/12.html#18">12:18</a>

<p><li>"Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel...." Huh? <a href="../1sam/13.html#1">13:1</a>

<p><li>"Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines ... And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, 
Let the Hebrews hear."<br>
After his son Jonathan killed some Philistines, Saul went around throughout Israel blowing a trumpet and saying, 
"Let the Hebrew hear." It is strange to read in the next chapter that Jonathan's God-assisted slaughter of 20 Philistines 
was "his first slaughter." Didn't this slaughter count, or what?  <a href="../1sam/13.html#3">13:3</a>

<p><li>"The Philistines gathered ... as the sand which is on the sea shore."<br>
OK. That might be a bit of an exaggeration.  <a href="../1sam/13.html#5">13:5</a>

<p><li>"The LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart."<br>
Samuel tells Saul that he's just not good enough for God. So God has chosen someone else to replace him as king. 
Who is this guy, this "man after his own heart" that God has chosen? 
<a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2006/07/david-man-after-gods-own-heart-wwdd.html">David!</a> 
<a href="../1sam/13.html#14">13:14</a>

<p><li>"In the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people 
that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found."<br>
There were only two swords in the entire Israelite army, Saul's and Jonathan's. <a href="../1sam/13.html#22">13:22</a>
    
<p><li>After Jonathan's first slaughter (20 men in one half acre), God showed his approval with "a very great trembling." 
<a href="../1sam/14.html#15">14:15</a>
    
<p><li>"I did but taste a little honey ... and, lo, I must die."<br>
Saul tells his soldiers not to eat anything until he kills all of his enemies, saying that anyone who eats anything is cursed. But his son Jonathan 
    didn't hear about his fathers curse and he ate a bit of honey. So he Saul says his son is cursed and must die. 
    <a href="../1sam/14.html#24">14:24-43</a>
    
    <p><li>"Samuel ... laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent."</i><br>
    Samuel was so upset that Saul left one Amalekite alive (instead of killing everyone like God commanded) that he tore his skirt. 
    <a href="../1sam/15.html#27">15:27</a>
    
<p><li>"The LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel?"<br>
God tells Samuel to quit moping around about Saul and get out and find another king. <a href="../1sam/16.html#1">16:1-3</a>    

<p><li>"An evil spirit from the Lord troubled him." but if God is good, then how could he have an 
evil spirit?  <a href="../1sam/16.html#14">16:14-16</a>, <a href="../1sam/16.html#23">23</a>

<p><li>Goliath was ten feet tall ("six cubits and a span").  <a href="../1sam/17.html#4">17:4</a>

<p><li>David caught a lion (and a bear?) "by his beard" and then killed him. <a href="../1sam/17.html#34">17:34-35</a>

<p><li>"David ... behaved himself wisely."<br>
Like when he buys his first wife with 200 Philistine foreskins a little later in this chapter. <a href="../1sam/18.html#5">18:5</a>

<p><li>"The evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied."  <a href="../1sam/18.html#10">18:10</a>

<p><li>"Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul."<br>
    Saul was afraid of David because "the Lord was with him." I suppose the Lord even tagged along with David when he cut off the 200 
    Philistine foreskins in v.27. Did God hold the penises as David cut them off or vice versa. <a href="../1sam/18.html#12">18:12</a>

<p><li>"And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him."<br>
    Read the story below (18:25-28) to see an example of David's wise behavior when God is with him. <a href="#14">18:14</a>
    
<p><li>"All Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them." <a href="../1sam/18.html#16">18:16</a>

<p><li>David kills 200 Philistines and brings their foreskins to Saul to buy his first wife (Saul's daughter Michal).
Saul had only asked for 100 foreskins, but David was feeling generous.  <a href="../1sam/18.html#25">18:25-27</a>

<p><li>"And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David."<br>
    (How else could David get so many foreskins?) <a href="../1sam/18.html#28">18:28</a>
    
    <p><li>"David behaved ... wisely." <a href="../1sam/18.html#30">18:30</a>

<p><li>And the evil spirit from the Lord was upon Saul." Poor guy, he just can't keep 
away from God's damned evil spirit. <a href="../1sam/19.html#9">19:9</a>

<p><li>"Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying ... the Spirit of God was 
upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied."<br>
Saul sent messengers to kill David. But when they messengers arrived and saw everyone prophesying, the spirit of the 
Lord came upon them too and they began prophesying. <a href="../1sam/19.html#20">19:20</a>

<p><li>"And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise." <a href="../1sam/19.html#21">19:21a</a>

<p><li>"And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied
    also." <a href="../1sam/19.html#21">19:21b</a>
    
<p><li>"He [Saul] went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied."<br>
Finally, Saul comes to see what's going on and the Spirit of God comes on him too and he prophesies.  <a href="../1sam/19.html#23">19:23</a>

<p><li>Saul gets a bit carried away with his prophesying "and he stripped off his clothes ... and 
lay down naked all that day and night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?" 
<a href="../1sam/19.html#24">19:24</a>

<p><li>"David ... fell on his face." <a href="../1sam/20.html#41">20:41</a>

<p><li>David acts like he's crazy, scribbles on the gates of Gath, and lets spit run down his beard. All this he did in
front of Israel's enemies in the hopes that they would take him in and protect him from Saul.  <a href="../1sam/21.html#12">21:12</a>

<p><li>"Saul went in to cover his feet." (Saul took a leak.) <a href="../1sam/24.html#3">24:3</a>

<p><li>"Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily."<br>
David snuck in and cut off a piece of Saul's skirt while he was relieving himself. Saul was so busy with his business that he 
didn't even see David or notice that his skirt was being cut. <a href="../1sam/24.html#4">24:4</a>

<p><li>"If I leave ... any that pisseth against the wall."<br>
David vows to will kill Nabal and all his men (or as he put it, "any that pisseth against the wall".) <a href="../1sam/25.html#22">25:22</a>

<p><li>When Abigail saw David, she ... fell ... on her face." <a href="../1sam/25.html#23">25:23</a>

<p><li>"Except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth 
against the wall."<br>
If Abigail hadn't come and paid him off, David would have killed Nabal and any of his people "that pisseth against the wall". 
<a href="../1sam/25.html#34">25:34</a>

<p><li>They were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them."<br>
David and Abishai sneak into Saul's tent and steal his spear and water jug without anyone noticing "because a deep sleep 
from the LORD was fallen upon them." <a href="../1sam/26.html#12">26:12</a>

<p><li> "And David smote the land and left neither man nor woman alive." (No wonder God liked David so much!)
Among those that David exterminated were the Amalekites. But there couldn't have been any Amalekites to kill since
Saul killed them all (<a href="../1sam/15.html#7">1 Sam.15:7-8</a>) just a little while before.  
<a href="../1sam/27.html#8">27:8-11</a>

<p><li>"And when Saul inquired of the Lord, the
Lord answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets." <a href="../1sam/28.html#6">28:6</a>

<p><li>Saul visits a woman with a "familiar spirit" and she brings Samuel back from the dead. Samuel once again
explains that God is angry at Saul for not killing all of the Amalekites. He says God is going to deliver all of Israel
into the hands of the Philistines. (Since Saul refused to slaughter innocent people, God will slaughter the Israelites.
Fair is fair.)  <a href="../1sam/28.html#8">28:8-19</a>

<p><li>"Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel." <a href="../1sam/28.html#11">28:11</a>

<p><li>"An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel." <a href="../1sam/28.html#14">28:14</a>

<p><li>"And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up?" <a href="../1sam/28.html#15">28:15</a>

<p><li>"David said unto Achish, But what have I done ... that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?"<br>
David was disappointed. He wanted to go kill Israelites with the Philistines. <a href="../1sam/29.html#8">29:8</a>

<p><li>The Amalekites are a tough tribe. Twice they were "utterly destroyed": first by Saul 
(<a href="../1sam/15.html#7">1 Sam.15:7-8</a>) and then by David (<a href="../1sam/27.html#9">1 Sam.27:9-11</a>). Yet here 
they are, just a few years later, fighting the Philistines! <a href="../1sam/30.html#1">30:1</a>

<p><li>"The Amalekites ... slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and went on their way."
Believers like to say that the Amalekites were so evil that God had to kill them all, even their women and children. 
Yet here the Amalekites behave far better than the Israelites by not killing their captives. 
(Compare these verses with God's command to Saul in <a href="../1sam/15.html#3">1 Sam.15:3</a>.) <a href="../1sam/30.html#1">30:1-2</a>

<p><li>"David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him." <a href="../1sam/30.html#6">30:6</a>

<p><li>"And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, 
Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake them." <a href="../1sam/30.html#8">30:8</a>

<p><li>"David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: 
and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men."<br>
David spends the day killing more of those pesky Amalekites. He kills all of them except for 400 that escaped on camels. (See 
<A href="../1sam/15.html#7">1 Sam.15:7-8</A> and <A href="../1sam/27.html#8">27:8-9</A> for the last two times
they were exterminated.) <a href="../1sam/30.html#17">30:17</a>

<p><li>"David ... returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites"<br>
    How could David find any Amalekites to slaughter? <a href="../1sam/15.html#8">Saul already killed them all</a> (except Agag, 
    <a href="../1sam/15.html#33">who was killed by Samuel</a>). <a hef="1.html#1">1:1</a>

<p><li>According to these verses, Saul was killed by an Amalekite. But Saul killed all the Amalekites 
(except for Agag who Samuel hacked to death) as God commanded in <a href="../1sam/15.html#3">1 Sam.15:3</a>, 
so how could he later be killed by one? <a href="../2sam/1.html#8">1:8-10</a>

<p><li>Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him."<br>
When Bible characters get upset, they tear their clothes. <a href="../2sam/1.html#11">1:11</a>

<p><li>Abner smites Asahel "under the fifth rib." <a href="../2sam/2.html#23">2:23</a> <br>(It seems that in 2 
Samuel this is the preferred place to get smitten. <a href="../2sam/3.html#27">3:27</a>, 
<a href="../2sam/4.html#6">4:6</a>, <a href="../2sam/20.html#10">20:10</a>)

<p><li>David says, "deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines."
Well, he actually paid with two hundred foreskins (see <a href="../1sam/18.html#27">1 Sam.18:27</a>).  
<a href="../2sam/3.html#14">3:14</a>

<p><li>"David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes."<br>
    Why do people in the Bible always they tear their clothes when they get upset? <a href="../2sam/3.html#31">3:31</a>

<p><li>"When David enquired of the LORD, he said ... come upon them over against the mulberry trees." <a href="../2sam/5.html#23">5:23</a>

<p><li>"When thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees ... then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite the host 
of the Philistines." <a href="../2sam/5.html#24">5:24</a>

<p><li>"The Lord of Hosts ... dwelleth between the cherubims." <a href="../2sam/6.html#2">6:2</a>

<p><li>"He fell on his face." <a href="../2sam/9.html#6">9:6</a>

<p><li>"Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me."<br>
    Nahash gouged out the eyes of Israelite messengers (or at least threatened to) in <a href="../1sam/11.html">1 Samuel 11</a>. 
	That's a strange way to show kindness! <a href="../2sam/10.html#2">10:2</a>
	
<p><li>"Hanun ... shaved off the one half of their beards, and cutt off their garments ... even to their 
    buttocks."<br>
    That'll teach them! <a href="../2sam/10.html#4">10:4</a>

<p><li>After Bathsheba's baby is killed by God, David comforts her by going "in unto her." She conceives and bears
another son (Solomon).  <a href="../2sam/12.html#24">12:24</a>

<p><li>"The Lord loved him ... and called his his name Jedidiah."<br>
After God killed Bathsheba's baby boy, David got her pregnant again. God loved this baby (and so he decided not to kill it) 
and he called him Jedidiah, but everyone else called him Solomon. <a href="../2sam/12.html#24">12:24-25</a>

<p><li>David puts on a gold crown weighing 1 talent (somewhere <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_%28unit%29">between 26 and 60 
        kilograms</a>). <br>(He had a very strong neck.) <a href="../2sam/12.html#30">12:30</a>
        
<p><li>"The king ... tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent."  
<a href="../2sam/13.html#31">13:31</a>
        
 <p><li>"She fell on her face." <a href="../2sam/14.html#4">14:4</a>
 
 <p><li>"Joab fell to the ground on his face." <a href="../2sam/14.html#22">14:22</a>
 
 <p><li>"In all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his
    beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no
    blemish in him."<br>
    Absolom was the best looking guy in all of Israel. He didn't have a blemish on his whole body. <a href="../2sam/14.html#25">14:25</a>


<p><li>"He weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels."<br>
    Since a shekel is about 11.5 grams, Absolom's hair weighed 2.3 kilograms!  <a href="../2sam/14.html#25">14:25-26</a>
    
<p><li>"Shimei ... cursed still as he came ... and he cast stones at David ... 
    And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man,
    and thou man of Belial."<br>
    Good for Shimei! It's about time David got what he deserved. <a href="../2sam/16.html#5">16:5-7</a>
    
<p><li>"The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD 
hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou 
art a bloody man."  <a href="../2sam/16.html#8">16:8</a>

<p><li> "The king said ... let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David ... let him curse; 
for the LORD hath bidden him." <a href="../2sam/16.html#10">16:10-11</a>

<p><li>"As David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, 
and threw stones at him, and cast dust." <a href="../2sam/16.html#13">16:13</a>

<p><li>"The wood [forest] devoured more people that day
     than the sword devoured." It must have been spooky forest to have devoured more than 20,000 
soldiers. <a href="../2sam/18.html#8">18:8</a>

<p><li>"And he fell ... upon his face." <a href="../2sam/18.html#25">18:25</a>
     
     <p><li>Amasa is viciously slaughtered by Joab by smiting him "in 
the fifth rib", of course. <a href="../2sam/20.html#10">20:10</a>

<p><li>"Then cried a wise woman out of the city ... Behold, his head shall be thrown 
to thee over the wall ... And they cut off the head of Sheba ... and cast it out to Joab." <a href="../2sam/20.html#16">20:16-22</a>

<p><li>A famine is sent on David's kingdom for three years. When David asks God why, God answers: "It is for Saul, 
and his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites." 
So God sent a famine to punish a kingdom for something that a former king had done. <a href="../2sam/21.html#1">21:1</a>

<p><li>To appease God and end the famine that was caused by his predecessor (Saul), David agrees to have two of Saul's sons and five 
of his grandsons killed and hung up "unto the Lord."  <a href="../2sam/21.html#6">21:6-9</a>

<p><li>"They gathered the bones of them that were hanged ... And after that God was intreated for the land."<br>
God stopped the famine after Saul's two sons and five grandsons were killed and hung up for him. <a href="../2sam/21.html#13">21:13-14</a>

<p><li>"Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant" <a href="../2sam/21.html#16">21:16</a>

<p><li>"Saph, which was of the sons of the giant" <a href="../2sam/21.html#18">21:18</a>

<p><li>There ... was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, 
four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant." <a href="../2sam/21.html#20">21:20</a>

<p><li>"These four were born to the giant in Gath." <a href="../2sam/21.html#22">21:22</a>

<p><li>"The earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth." <a href="../2sam/22.html#8">22:8</a>

<p><li>"There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth." <a href="../2sam/22.html#9">22:9</a>

<p><li>"He ... came down; and darkness was under his feet." <a href="../2sam/22.html#10">22:10</a>

<p><li>"He rode upon a  cherub, and did fly." <a href="../2sam/22.html#11">22:11</a>

<p><li>"The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High (who?) uttered his voice." <a href="../2sam/22.html#14">22:14</a>

<p><li>"The foundations of the world were discovered ... at the blast of the breath of his nostrils." <a href="../2sam/22.html#16">22:16</a>

<p><li>"I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God."<br>
David is one of the most despicable characters in all fiction, yet here he brags about how perfect he is. (And God agrees with him! 
<a href="#22">22:22-24</a>

<p><li>The chief of David's captains killed with his own spear 800 guys at one time. 
<a href="../2sam/23.html#8">23:8</a>

<p><li>Eleazar the son of Dodo killed so many Philistines that his hand stuck to his sword. <a href="../2sam/23.html#9">23:9-10</a>

<p><li>David was thirsty, so he asked someone to get him some water from the Bethlehem well, 
which was controlled by the Philistines. Three of his men broke through the enemy lines, got the water from 
the well, and brought it back to David. But he refused to drink it and poured it on the ground. 
<a href="../2sam/23.html#15">23:15-17</a>

<p><li>"Abishai ... lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew them." <a href="../2sam/23.html#18">23:18</a>

<p><li>"Benaiah the son of Jehoiada ... slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst 
of a pit in time of snow. And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand." 
<a href="../2sam/23.html#20">23:20-21</a>

<p><li>"Thrity and seven in all."</i><br>
  How come only 31 are listed in verses 24-39? <a href="../2sam/23.html#39">23:39</a>

<p><li>God tempts David to take census, though <A href="../1chr/21.html#1">1 Chr.21:1</A> says
that Satan tempted David, and <A href="../jas/1.html#13">Jas.1:13</A> says that
God never tempts anyone. Why did God or Satan tempt David to take the census? 
And what the heck is wrong with a census anyway? <a href="../2sam/24.html#1">24:1</a>

<p><li>Israel had 1,300,000 fighting men in this battle. Of course, this is a ridiculously high number for a 
battle between two tribal armies in 1000 BCE. (The United States had about
<a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/almanac/almanac/at_a_glance.html">1.37 
million</a> active duty soldiers in 2001.) <a href="../2sam/24.html#9">24:9</a>

<p><li>God offers David a choice of punishments for having conducted the census: 1) seven
years of famine (<A href="../1chr/21.html#12">1 Chr.21:12</A> says three years), 2) three months fleeing from enemies, or 
3) three days of pestilence. David can't decide, so God chooses for him and sends a pestilence, killing 70,000 men
(and probably around 200,000 women and children). <a href="../2sam/24.html#13">24:13</a>

<p><li>After God threatens to kill hundreds of thousands of 
innocent people for a census that he inspired, David says, "let us fall now into the hand of the 
LORD; for his mercies are great." <a href="../2sam/24.html#14">24:14</a>

<p><li>Finally, when an angel is about to destroy Jerusalem, &quot;the Lord repented.&quot; That's nice, but why would a good God 
have to repent of the evil that he planned to do?  <a href="../2sam/24.html#16">24:16</a>

<p><li>"The LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee."<br>
God appeared to Solomon in a dream and offered him whatever he wanted. <a href="../1kg/3.html#5">3:5</a>

<p><li>God grants Solomon's' request and makes him the wisest of all men. (He was wiser even than Jesus.) He also
promises to "lengthen Solomon's days" if he will only "walk in my ways, ... as thy father David did walk."  
<a href="../1kg/3.html#12">3:12-14</a>

<p><li>And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream."<br>
It was only a dream. None of it every happened. God didn't appear to Solomon and God didn't make him the wisest person on earth. 
It was just a silly dream like we all have now and then. <a href="../1kg/3.html#15">3:15</a>

<p><li>"God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore." 
<a href="../1kg/4.html#29">4:29</a>

<p><li>How could Solomon be "wiser than all men" and yet have his heart "turned away ... after other gods?" 
(<a href="../1kg/11.html#4">1 Kg.11:4</a>)  <a href="../1kg/4.html#29">4:29-31</a>

<p><li>"He was wiser than ... Heman." <a href="../1kg/4.html#31">4:31</a>

<p><li>The house that "Solomon built for the Lord" was tiny compared to the one he built for himself. According
to <a href="../1kg/7.html#1">7:1-2</a>
, God's house had less than one-quarter the floor space of Solomon's.  <a href="../1kg/6.html#2">6:2</a>, 
<a href="../1kg/7.html#1">7:1-2</a>

<p><li>When the priests brought the ark into the temple, a "cloud filled the house of the LORD So that the priests" could not see.  
<a href="../1kg/8.html#10">8:10-11</a>

<p><li>God creates droughts by causing "heaven to shut up" as a punishment for sin. <a href="../1kg/8.html#35">8:35</a>

<p><li>When dedicating the temple, Solomon kills 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. <a href="../1kg/8.html#63">8:63</a>

<p><li>The LORD appeared to Solomon the second time ... and the LORD said unto him...."<br>
God and Solomon have a long face to face talk. <a href="../1kg/9.html#2">9:2-3</a>

<p><li>"They came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon."<br>
420 talents would be about 31,500 pounds of gold, which would be worth more than one half billion U.S. dollars today. 
<a href="../1kg/9.html#28">9:28</a>

<p><li>"She gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold."<br>
    Since a talent was about 75 pounds, the Queen of Sheba gave Solomon 9000 pounds of gold, which would be worth around 144 million 
    U.S. dollars today. <a href="../1kg/10.html#10">10:10</a>
    
<p><li>"The weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred
    threescore and six talents of gold."<br>
    Every year, Solomon received 666 talents of gold, which sounds a bit satanic to me. (666 talents of gold would weigh about 
    50,000 pounds and would be worth nearly 800 million U.S. dollars today.) <a href="../1kg/10.html#14">10:14</a>

<p><li>"And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones."<br>
    When Solomon was king, silver was as common as stones in Jerusalem. <a href="../1kg/10.html#27">10:27</a>

<p><li>"King Solomon loved many strange women."<br>
God didn't mind the number so much; it was their "strangeness" that he objected to.  <a href="../1kg/11.html#1">11:1</a>

<p><li>"He had seven hundred wives ... and three hundred concubines." <a href="../1kg/11.html#3">11:3</a>

<p><li>His wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God."<br>
The wisest man that ever lived (<A href="../1kg/4.html#31">1 Kings 4:31</A>) was misled by his wives into worshipping other gods. 
<a href="../1kg/11.html#4">11:4</a>

<p><li>His heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father ... Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as did David his father."
David was one of the most disgusting characters in all fiction, yet "his heart was perfect with the Lord."  
<a href="../1kg/11.html#4">11:4, 6</a>

<p><li>"Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, 
and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon."<br>
Solomon (the wisest man that ever lived) worshipped many gods, including Ashtoreth, Micom, Chemosh, and Molech. 
<a href="../1kg/11.html#7">11:7</a>

<p><li>"The LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite."<br>
To punish Solomon for his strange wives and strange gods, God "stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite." 
<a href="../1kg/11.html#14">11:14</a>

<p><li>"Joab ... had smitten every male in Edom."</i><br>
 Joab (David's captain) spent six months killing every male in Edom. Yet a few years later Edom revolted. (<A

God likes Jerusalem better than any other city. <a href="../1kg/11.html#36">11:36</a>

O altar, altar...." <a href="../1kg/13.html#1">13:1-2</a>

<p><li>This is the sign which the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be 
poured out ... The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of 
God had given by the word of the LORD." <a href="../1kg/13.html#3">13:3-5</a>

<p><li>"And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up ... And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king's 
hand was restored him again."<br>
Ever the playful spirit, God withers, and then restores, the hand of king Jeroboam.  <a href="../1kg/13.html#4">13:4-6</a>

<p><li>"A lion met him by the way, and slew him."<br>
So there were these two prophets. The first prophet lied to the second. To the punish the second for believing the first's lie, 
God sent a lion to kill him. Get it?  <a href="../1kg/13.html#11">13:11-24</a>

<p><li>After killing the "man of God" for God, the lion hung around with the ass and the carcass on the side of the road for a few days. 
<a href="../1kg/13.html#24">13:24-25, 28</a>

<p><li>"When the prophet ... heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the word of the LORD: 
therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD." 
<a href="../1kg/13.html#26">13:26</a>

<p><li>Everything that David did was right in the eyes of the Lord. (See

    God considers "right".) <a href="../1kg/14.html#8">14:8</a> 
    
<p><li>"But [Jeroboam] hast done evil above all that were before thee."<br>
    Jeroboam did more evil than everyone who has ever lived. <a href="../1kg/14.html#9">14:9</a>

<p><li>"And his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as was the heart of David his father."  <a href="../1kg/15.html#3">15:3</a>

<p><li>"For David's sake"<br>
God has a hard-on for David. He'll do just about anything for David's sake. <a href="../1kg/15.html#4">15:4</a>

<p><li>"David did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, 
and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite."<br>
David never sinned, "save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite." <a href="../1kg/15.html#5">15:5</a>

<p><li>Did Abijam marry his own mother?<br>
  Since Asa's father was Abijam and they had the same mother (Maachah), Abijam was both father and 
  brother to Asa. <a href="../1kg/15.html#9">15:9-10</a>

<p><li>"Omri ... did worse than all that were before him."<br>
Omni was the worst person that ever existed (up to that time, anyway). <a href="../1kg/16.html#25">16:25</a>

<p><li>"Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that were before him."<br>
Ahab was the worst person that ever existed. He replaced his father Omri as the worst person in the world. 
<a href="../1kg/16.html#30">16:30</a>

<p><li> "Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him." 
<a href="../1kg/16.html#33">16:33</a>

<p><li>Ravens bring Elijah bread and flesh for breakfast and dinner.  <a href="../1kg/17.html#6">17:6</a>

<p><li>"The hand of the Lord was on Elijah, and he girded up his loins." <a href="../1kg/18.html#46">18:46</a>

<p><li>"An angel touched him."<br>
Elijah was touched by an angel. <a href="../1kg/19.html#5">19:5</a>

<p><li>"Behold, there was a cake ... and he did eat."<br>
Elijah ate some angel food cake. <a href="../1kg/19.html#6">19:6</a>

<p><li>"He arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights."<br>
Elijah went forty days on two (angel food cake) meals.  <a href="../1kg/19.html#7">19:8</a>

<p><li> God passes by and causes a great wind, earthquake, fire, and a little voice. (God was in the little voice.) 
<a href="../1kg/19.html#11">19:11-12</a>

<p><li>"The servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods are gods of the hills."<br>
God killed 127,000 Syrians because they called him a "God of the hills." (See verses <a haref="20.html#28">28-30</a>) 
<a href="../1kg/20.html#23">20:23</a>

<p><li>God delivers the Syrians into the Israelites' hands, and 100,000 were killed in one day. Of those that escaped,
27,000 were crushed by a falling wall. (It was a really big wall.) <a href="../1kg/20.html#28">20:28-30</a> 

<p><li>"A man of God ... said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD is God of the hills, 
but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall 
know that I am the LORD."<br>
God kills 127,000 Syrians because they said he was God of the hills but not God of the valleys. <a href="../1kg/20.html#28">20:28</a>

<p><li>"The children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day." <a href="../1kg/20.html#29">20:29</a>

<p><li>"There a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left." <a href="../1kg/20.html#30">20:30</a>

<p><li>There was this son of a prophet that said to his neighbor, "Smite me." But the neighbor refused. 
So God sent a lion to devour him. True story.  <a href="../1kg/20.html#35">20:35-36</a>

<p><li>"A certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, 
I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him." <a href="../1kg/20.html#35">20:35</a>

<p><li>Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee. 
And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him." <a href="../1kg/20.html#36">20:36</a>

<p><li>"When Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes." <a href="../1kg/21.html#27">21:27</a>

<p><li>"And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab?"<br>
God asks for volunteer among the guys hanging out with him. He wants one of them to lie for him so that he can get Ahab kiiled.

<p><li>He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah."
(Nobody dresses like Elijah!) <a href="../2kg/1.html#8">1:8</a>

<p><li>Elijah shows that he is "a man of God" by burning 102 men to death.  <a href="../2kg/1.html#10">1:10, 12</a>

<p><li>When Elijah needs to cross a river, he just
smacks the water with his magic mantle and crosses on dry land. <a href="../2kg/2.html#8">2:8</a>

<p><li>"Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me." <a href="../2kg/2.html#9">2:9</a>

<p><li>"Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven." <a href="../2kg/2.html#11">2:11</a>

<p><li>"He took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces." <a href="../2kg/2.html#12">2:12</a>

<p><li>Elisha repeats Elijah's trick of parting the waters of the Jordan by smiting them with his mantle. 
 <a href="../2kg/2.html#14">2:14</a>
 
<p><li>Elisha "heals" the waters by adding a pinch of salt.  <a href="../2kg/2.html#20">2:20-22</a>

<p><li>God sends two bears to rip up 42 little children for making fun of Elisha's bald head.  <a href="../2kg/2.html#23">2:23-24</a>

<p><li>Elisha restores the life of a dead child, but only after laying on him 
a couple of times, putting his mouth on the child's mouth, his eyes on the child's eyes, and
his hands on the child's hands. Finally, the child responds by sneezing seven
times. <a href="../2kg/4.html#32">4:32-35</a>

<p><li>Elisha put some meal (flour) in a pot to counteract the poison in a pot of stew. <a href="../2kg/4.html#40">4:40-41</a>

<p><li>"When the king of Israel had read the letter ... he rent his clothes." <a href="../2kg/5.html#7">5:7</a>

<p><li>"When Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore
    hast thou rent thy clothes?" <a href="../2kg/5.html#8">5:8</a>

<p><li>Elisha can do all the tricks of Jesus (raise the dead, heal the sick, etc.). Here he cures a leper, but only after the
leper dips himself seven times in the Jordan.  <a href="../2kg/5.html#14">5:14</a>

<p><li>Elisha makes an iron ax head swim. Neat trick, not even Jesus did that one!  
<a href="../2kg/6.html#6">6:6</a>

<p><li>"Elisha ... telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber."<br>
Elisha is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clairaudience">clairaudient</a> (acquires psychic knowledge 
by auditory means). <a href="../2kg/6.html#12">6:12</a>

<p><li>Elisha prayed and "behold,
    the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha." <a href="../2kg/6.html#17">6:17</a>
    
<p><li>With God's help, Elisha first blinds the Syrians and then restores their sight. 
<a href="../2kg/6.html#18">6:18-20</a>

<p><li>"An ass's head was
    sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's
    dung for five pieces of silver." <a href="../2kg/6.html#25">6:25</a>
    
<p><li>When the king heard the words of the woman ... he rent his clothes." <a href="../2kg/6.html#30">6:30</a>  

<p><li>God forcasts the commodities market: Tommorow about this time, flour with sell for this and barley for that. 
<a href="../2kg/7.html#1">7:1</a>  

<p><li>God made noises to scare the Syrians. He's such a clever guy! <a href="../2kg/7.html#6">7:6</a>
    
<p><li>The Edomites revolt. But how could they have fought when all of their males had just recently been killed? 
(<a href="../1kg/11.html#16">1 Kg.11:16</a>)  <a href="../2kg/8.html#22">8:22</a>

<p><li>Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins." <a href="../2kg/9.html#1">9:1</a>

<p><li>"Wherefore came this mad fellow to thee?"<br>
One of Jehu's officers called Elisha a madman (which, of course, he was). <a href="../2kg/9.html#11">9:11</a>

<p><li>"He driveth furiously."<br>
Jehu is the patron saint of reckless drivers. <a href="../2kg/9.html#20">9:20</a>

<p><li>"When he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab  coming to meet him  
and said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thine hand. And he 
gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot."<br>
After meeting with Ahaziahs family (and killing them all), Jehu got into his chariot and drove away furiously toward Samaria. On his way, 
he ran across his old friend, Jehonadab. Jehu asked him, Is your heart true to mine as mine is to yours? And Jehonadab said, It is. 
(They were very good friends.) <a href="../2kg/10.html#15">10:15</a>

<p><li>When Jehonadab and Jehu were finally alone, Jehu said, "Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD." <a href="../2kg/10.html#16">10:16</a>

<p><li>Elisha tells Joash to shoot an arrow out the window. Joash shoots the magic arrow out the window, which guarantees 
that he will "smite the Syrians" until he "consumes them." <a href="../2kg/13.html#15">13:15-17</a>

<p><li>Elisha tells Joash to hit the ground with his arrow. So he smacks the ground three times. Elisha then yells at him,
saying he should have struck the ground five or six times. If he had, then he would have completely wiped out Syria, but now
since he only struck the ground three times, he'll only get to smite Syria three times. Shucks!  <a href="../2kg/13.html#18">13:18-19</a>

<p><li>A dead body is brought to life when it accidentally touches the bones of Elisha. <a href="../2kg/13.html#21">13:21</a>

<p><li>According to this verse, Ahaz was 36 years old when he completed his reign. And 18:1-2 says that he was
succeeded by a 25 year old son, Hezekiah. This means that Ahaz fathered Hezakiah when he was only eleven years
old!  <a href="../2kg/16.html#2">16:2</a>

<p><li>Hezekiah, the son of Ahaz, began to reign when he was 25 years old. His father was 36 years old when
Hezekiah took over (<a href="../2kg/16.html#2">16:2</a>). So Ahaz was only eleven years old when he fathered Hezekiah!  
<a href="../2kg/18.html#1">18:1-2</a>

<p><li>While Hezekiah was busy doing things that were "right in the sight of the Lord," he broke the brazen 
serpent that God told Moses to make in <a href="../num/21.html#8">Num.21:8</a>. <a href="../2kg/18.html#3">18:3-4</a>

<p><li>"Shebna ... and Joah with their clothes rent."<br>
People either tear their clothes or fall on their face when they get upset in the Bible. <a hef="18.html#37">18:37</a>

<p><li>"When king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes." <a href="../2kg/19.html#1">19:1</a>

<p><li>An "angel of the Lord" kills 185,000 men while they sleep. "And when they arose early in the morning, behold,
they were all dead corpses." I guess they all woke up and said, "Shucks, I'm dead."  <a href="../2kg/19.html#35">19:35</a>

<p><li>Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it on the
    boil, and he recovered." <a href="../2kg/20.html#7">20:7</a>

<p><li>Isaiah, with a little help from God, makes the sun move backwards ten degrees. Now that's quite a trick. All at
once, the earth stopped spinning and then reversed its direction of rotation. Or maybe the sun traveled around the
earth in those days!  <a href="../2kg/20.html#11">20:11</a>

<p><li>God plans to "bring such evil upon
Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle." <a href="../2kg/21.html#12">21:12</a>
  
<p><li>"I [God] will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down." <a href="../2kg/21.html#13">21:13</a>

<p><li>"When the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes." <a href="../2kg/22.html#11">22:11</a>

<a href="11.html#23">11:23</a>-->

<p><li>"So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts was with him."<br>
  It would be hard to find a more disgusting character in all fiction than David, but "the Lord of hosts was with him." 
  <a href="../1chr/11.html#9">11:9</a>
  
<p><li>The chief of David's captains killed with his own spear 300 guys at one time. 
<a href="../1chr/11.html#11">11:11</a>

<p><li>Eleazar the son of Dodo ... one of the three mighties ... slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved them by a great deliverance." 
<a href="../1chr/11.html#12">11:12-14</a>

<p><li>David was thirsty, so he asked someone to get him some water from the Bethlehem well, 
which was controlled by the Philistines. Three of his men broke through the enemy lines, got the water from

30 feet wide, and 45 feet high.) <a href="../2chr/2.html#2">2:2</a>

<p><li>God sent Shishak, the king of Egypt, to attack Jerusalem because Rehoboam "and all Israel transgressed against the Lord." 
Shishak had 1200 chariots, 60,000 horsemen and "people without number" and he attacked Judah and "took the fenced cities which 
pertained to Judah." When Shishak's army came to Jerusalem, "the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves" and said, 
"The Lord is righteous." So God decided not to destroy Jerusalem, but just make them Shishak's slaves instead.

<p><li>A half million soldiers die in a single God-assisted slaughter. <a href="../2chr/13.html#16">13:16-17</a>
<p><li>In the largest single God-assisted massacre in the bible, Asa, with God's help, kills one million Ethiopians.
 <a href="../2chr/14.html#8">14:8-14</a>
 
 <p><li>Everybody loved Asa and wanted to follow him because they could see that God was with him. <a href="#15.html#9">15:9</a>

 <p><li>According to this verse, Baasha fought with Judah 
in the 36th year of Asa's reign, yet <a href="../1kg/16.html#6">1 Kg.16:6-8</a> says 
that Baasha died in the 26th year of Asa's reign. So if both stories are true, Baasha was still fighting 10 years

<p><li>"The eyes of the Lord run to and fro."  <a href="../2chr/16.html#9">16:9</a>

<p><li>Asa, when he had a foot disease, went to physicians instead of seeking the Lord. (God disapproves
of those who seek medical help rather than "seeking the Lord.")  <a href="../2chr/16.html#12">16:12</a>

<p><li>The trouble with prophets <a href="../2chr/18.html#5">18:5-34</a>

<p><li>God puts lies into the mouths of his prophets and speaks evil about people. 
<a href="../2chr/18.html#21">18:21-22</a>

<p><li>The spirit of the Lord came upon Jahaziel (the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, 
the son of Mattanaiah) and told the people of Judah that they didn't have to fight against the Moabites, Ammonites, 
and Edomites. God would fight for them. And he did. God fought for them by forcing the members of the opposing army 
to kill each other. Then the people of Judah spent three days stripping the jewels and other valuables from the dead bodies.  
<a href="../2chr/20.html#14">20:14-25</a>

Jehoram began to reign after Elijah went to heaven (<a href="../2kg/2.html#11">2 Kg.2:11</a>, 
<a href="../2kg/8.html#16">8:16</a>), so how could King Jehoram receive a letter from him?  
<a href="../2chr/21.html#12">21:12</a>

<p><li>Jehoram was 32 years old when he began to reign and he reigned for eight years and then died (a 40
years old). After his death, his youngest son Ahaziah began to reign at the age of 42 (<a href="../2chr/22.html#1">22:1-2</a>). 
So the son (Ahaziah) was two years older than his father!  <a href="../2chr/21.html#20">21:20</a>, 
<a href="../2chr/22.html#1">22:1-2</a>

<p><li>"Then Athaliah rent her clothes." <a href="../2chr/23.html#13">23:13</a>

<p><li>"Jehoiada ... was full ... an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died." <a href="../2chr/24.html#15">24:15</a>

<p><li>"The
    thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying,
    Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that
    was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle." <a href="../2chr/25.html#18">25:18</a>

<p><li>God makes Uzziah a leper for burning incense without a license.  <a href="../2chr/26.html#19">26:19-21</a>

<p><li>"He (Ahaz) ... burnt incense ... under every green tree." <a href="../2chr/28.html#4">28:4</a>

<p><li>Pekah killed 120,000 people in one day. <a href="../2chr/28.html#6">28:6, 8</a>

<p><li>"All Israel ... went out to
    the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down the
    groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah ... 
    until they had utterly destroyed them all." <a href="../2chr/31.html#1">31:1</a>

<p><li>An eight year-old king (Jehoiachin) did "evil in the sight of the Lord." <a href="../2chr/36.html#9">36:9</a>

<p><li>"The LORD his God be with him, and let him go up." Now how's that for a strange ending? Actually, the last
two verses from 2 Chronicles are taken from the first few verses of <a href="../ezra/1.html#1">Ezra</a>. It just happens 
that whoever decided to tack these verses on (for whatever reason) forgot to finish the sentence!

sunburn, and moonburn too. <a href="../ps/121.html#5">121:5-6</a>

<p><li>"Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee."<br>
Jews, Christians, and Muslims all love Jerusalem, and fight each other for the holy city, exclusively given to them by God. None of them prosper.

The author of Ecclesiastes claims to be the wise, rich son of King David, which is to say, Solomon. He isn't. Ecclesiastes was written 
(forged) about six hundred years after Solomon died (if he ever lived, that is). <a href="../ec/1.html#1">1:1</a>, <a href="../ec/1.html#12">12</a>,

<p><li>"The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be

     reflects that of the sun, it could never shine like the sun. And the sun will not, at least not while there are humans to see

The author of Ecclesiastes claims to be the wise, rich son of King David, which is to say, Solomon. He isn't. Ecclesiastes was written 
(forged) about six hundred years after Solomon died (if he ever lived, that is). <a href="../ec/1.html#1">1:1</a>, <a href="../ec/1.html#12">12</a>,

<p><li>"No man can find out the work that God maketh."<br>
Science is impossible. We can learn nothing at all about the natural world. <a href="../ec/3.html#11">3:11b</a>

<p><li>"That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?"<br>
    Who can find out? We can by using science! The earth, ocean, solar system, galaxy, and universe -- nothing is too deep or far away for 
    science to discover and explore. <a href="../ec/7.html#24">7:24</a>

<p><li>"Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work
    that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet
    he shall not find it; yea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet
    shall he not be able to find it."<br>

<p><li>"The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem ... I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem ... I am come to great 
estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me."<br>
The author of Ecclesiastes claims to be the wise, rich son of King David, which is to say, Solomon. He isn't. Ecclesiastes was written 
(forged) about six hundred years after Solomon died (if he ever lived, that is). <a href="../ec/1.html#1">1:1</a>, <a href="../ec/1.html#12">12</a>,

Everything is beautiful in its own way. Parasitic worms, cancer cells, bubonic plague. You just have to look at it from God's eyes.
<a href="../ec/3.html#11">3:11a</a>

<p><li>"No man can find out the work that God maketh."<br>
Science is impossible. We can learn nothing at all about the natural world. <a href="../ec/3.html#11">3:11b</a>

    Who can find out? We can by using science! The earth, ocean, solar system, galaxy, and universe -- nothing is too deep or far away for

    that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet
    he shall not find it; yea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet
    shall he not be able to find it."<br>
    Oh, I think science has done a pretty good job of finding things out over the last four centuries or so. <a href="../ec/8.html#16">8:16</a>

<p><li>In all matters of wisdom and understanding ... the king ... found them [Daniel and his friends] 
ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers in his realm. <a href="../dan/1.html#20">1:20</a>

<p><li>"King Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel." <a href="../dan/2.html#46">2:46</a>

<p><li>Nebuchadnezzar built a statue of gold sixty cubits high and six cubits wide. Taking 
a cubit to be 18 inches and assuming the depth to also be six cubits, this would give 
a total volume of 270 cubic yards -- which would have probably been more than all of the gold in all of 
the kingdoms of the world at that time. <a href="../dan/3.html#1">3:1</a>

<p><li>Daniel's three friends were cast into a fiery furnace, but were totally unaffected -- not even a hair was 
singed. And they were joined by the Son of God (Jesus?), himself! At least that's who Nebuchadnezzar 
thought it looked like. <a href="../dan/3.html#25">3:25-27</a>

<p><li>This part of the Bible was written by Nebuchadnezzar. <a href="../dan/4.html#1">4:1-18</a>

<p><li> Nebuchadnezzar eats grass, his hair becomes like eagle feathers and his nails like bird claws.

<p><li>A detached hand writes upon the wall, and when the king sees it &quot;the joints of his 
loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against the other.&quot;  <a href="../dan/5.html#5">5:5-6</a>

<p><li>Daniel was cast into the lions' den, but they didn't hurt him since 
God sent angel to shut the lions' mouths. <a href="../dan/6.html#16">6:16-22</a>

<p><li>God's hair is white (but you already knew that!). <a href="../dan/7.html#9">7:9</a>

visions, then how could anyone else?) This is the one true prophecy in the book of 
Daniel: "none understood it." <a href="../dan/8.html#27">8:27</a>
