 Ahaziah was sick and sent messengers to
Baalzebub to ask if he would recover. God was jealous of the attention given to
his competitor so he told Ahaziah (through the "hairy man" Elijah) that he would die for asking the wrong god.

<p>(1:2) <i>"Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber ... and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, 
Go, enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease."</i>

<p>(1:4) <i>"Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up,
    but shalt surely die."</i>
    
    <p>(1:6) <i>"There came a man up to meet us, and said ... Thus saith the
    LORD, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to

    from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die."</i>
    
    <p>(1:7) <i>"What manner of man was he?"</i>
