<p><li>David tells one of his "young men" to kill the Amalekite messenger who claimed to have mercifully killed Saul
at Saul's own request.  <a href="1.html#15">1:15</a>

<p><li>Joab and Abner watch as the young men "play" a cruel game. "And they caught every one his fellow by the
head, and thrust his sword in his fellow side, so they fell down together."  <a href="2.html#14">2:14</a>

<p><li>When Joab (David's captain) kills Abner (by smiting him under the fifth rib of course), David says that he
and his kingdom are not responsible. The blame, he says, lays with Joab. So David curses Joab, his family, and their
descendants forever. Let them all be plagued with venereal diseases and leprosy, starve to death, commit suicide, or
lean on staves. (The Revised Standard Version translates "leaneth on a staff" as "holds a spindle," apparently
meaning effeminate -- real men don't spin or weave.)  <a href="3.html#27">3:27-29</a>

<p><li>Some of David's men kill Saul's son (by smiting him under the fifth rib, of course) and bring his head to
David, thinking that he'll be pleased. But he wasn't. David has the assassins killed, their hands and feet chopped off,
and their bodies hung up (for decorations?) over the pool in Hebron.  <a href="4.html#6">4:6-7</a>

<p><li>Whoever kills the lame and the blind will be David's "chief and captain."  <a href="5.html#8">5:8</a>

<p><li>Uzzah tries to keep the ark from falling off the cart, and God kills him for it. I guess it was God's way of saying
Thanks. <a href="6.html#6">6:6-7</a>

<p><li>David tells Joab (his captain) to send Bathsheba's husband (Uriah) to "the forefront of the hottest battle
... that he may be smitten and die." In this way, David gets another wife.  <a href="11.html#15">11:15</a>, 
<a href="11.html#17">11:17</a>, <a href="11.html#27">11:27</a>

<p><li>To punish David for having Uriah killed, God kills Bathsheba's baby boy.  <a href="12.html#14">12:14-18</a>

<p><li>David saws, hacks, and burns to death all the inhabitants of several cities. Maybe this is what is meant by "the
tender mercies of David" (<a href="../acts/13.html#34">Acts 13:34</a>).  <a href="12.html#31">12:31</a>

<p><li>Amasa is viciously slaughtered by Joab, who "shed out his bowels to the ground ... And Amasa wallowed
in blood in the midst of the highway."  <a href="20.html#10">20:10, 12</a>

<p><li>"And they cut off the head of Sheba ... and cast it out to Joab."  <a href="20.html#21">20:21-22</a>

<p><li> A famine is sent on David's kingdom for three years. When David asks God why, God answers: "It is for Saul,
and his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites. "So God sent a famine to punish a kingdom for something that
a former king had done.  <a href="21.html#1">21:1</a>

<p><li>To appease God and end the famine that was caused by his predecessor (Saul), David agrees to have seven of
Saul's sons killed and hung up "unto the Lord." <a href="21.html#6">21:6-9</a>

<p><li>"He teacheth my hands to war." Might as well learn from an expert.  <a href="22.html#35">22:35</a>

<p><li>God offers David a choice of punishments for having conducted the census: 1) seven years of famine (
<a href="../1chr/21.html#1">1 Chronicles 21:1</a> says three years), 2) three months fleeing from enemies, or 3) three days 
of pestilence. David can't decide, so God chooses for him and sends a pestilence, killing 70,000 men (and probably 
around 200,000 women and children).  <a href="24.html#13">24:13</a>
