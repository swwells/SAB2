<p><li>"Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him." This could only happen on a 
flat earth. <a href="1.html#7">1:7</a>

<p><li>"Thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created." God created parasites, 
pathogens, and predators for his very own pleasure. One of his favorite species is

<p><li>The sixth seal is opened and there is a great earthquake, the sun becomes black, and the moon red, 
the stars fall from heaven, and mountains and islands move around. <a href="6.html#12">6:12-14</a>

<p><li>"And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth...." To John, the stars are just little lights a few miles away that can
easily fall to the earth.  <a href="6.html#13">6:13</a>

<p><li>John "saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth." Well, I guess that settles it: the earth is flat and

<p><li>An angel threw the censer down to earth, causing thunder, lightning, and earthquakes.
<a href="8.html#5">8:5</a>

<p><li>"And there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers,
and upon the fountains of waters." In the Bible, stars are just little lights that can fall to the

<p><li> The dragon's tail smacks down to earth one third of the stars. To the author of Revelation,
the stars are just little lights that can fall to the ground from the sky. <a href="12.html#4">12:4</a>

<p><li>The seventh vial: voices, thunders, lightnings, earthquakes, hail. <a href="16.html#17">16:17-21</a>

<p><li>"And there was no more sea."<br>
For an old sailor like me, this verse, if it were true, would
