<td bgcolor="eeeeee" >

<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>13:1</b>   And now I, Moroni, proceed to finish my record concerning the destruction of the people of whom I have been 
writing. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>13:2</b>   For behold, they rejected all the words of Ether; for he truly told them of all things, from the beginning 
of man; and that after the waters had receded from off the face of this land it became a choice land above all other 
lands, a chosen land of the Lord; wherefore the Lord would have that all men should serve him who dwell upon the 
face thereof; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>13:3</b>   And that it was the place of the New Jerusalem, which should come down out of heaven, and the holy 
sanctuary of the Lord. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>13:4</b>   Behold, Ether saw the days of Christ, and he spake concerning a New Jerusalem upon this land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>13:5</b>   And he spake also concerning the house of Israel, and the Jerusalem from whence Lehi should come -- after it 
should be destroyed it should be built up again, a holy city unto the Lord; wherefore, it could not be a new Jerusalem for 
it had been in a time of old; but it should be built up again, and become a holy city of the Lord; and it should be built 
unto the house of Israel. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>13:6</b>   And that a New Jerusalem should be built upon this land, unto the remnant of the seed of Joseph, for which 
things there has been a type. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>13:7</b>   For as Joseph brought his father down into the land of Egypt, even so he died there; wherefore, the 
Lord brought a remnant of the seed of Joseph out of the land of Jerusalem, that he might be merciful unto the seed of 
Joseph that they should perish not, even as he was merciful unto the father of Joseph that he should perish not. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>13:8</b>   Wherefore, the remnant of the house of Joseph shall be built upon this land; and it shall be a land of 
their inheritance; and they shall build up a holy city unto the Lord, like unto the Jerusalem of old; and they shall no 
more be confounded, until the end come when the earth shall pass away. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>13:9</b>   And there shall be a new heaven and a new earth; and they shall be like unto the old save the old have 
passed away, and all things have become new. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>13:10</b>   And then cometh the New Jerusalem; and blessed are they who dwell therein, for it is they whose 
garments are white through the blood of the Lamb; and they are they who are numbered among the remnant of the seed 
of Joseph, who were of the house of Israel. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>13:11</b>   And then also cometh the Jerusalem of old; and the inhabitants thereof, blessed are they, for they 
have been washed in the blood of the Lamb; and they are they who were scattered and gathered in from the four quarters 
of the earth, and from the north countries, and are partakers of the fulfilling of the covenant which God made with 
their father, Abraham. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>13:12</b>   And when these things come, bringeth to pass the scripture which saith, there are they who were first, 
who shall be last; and there are they who were last, who shall be first. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>13:13</b>   And I was about to write more, but I am forbidden; but great and marvelous were the prophecies of 
Ether; but they esteemed him as naught, and cast him out; and he hid himself in the cavity of a rock by day, and by 
night he went forth viewing the things which should come upon the people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>13:14</b>   And as he dwelt in the cavity of a rock he made the remainder of his record, viewing the destructions 
which came upon the people, by night. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>13:15</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that in that same year in which he was cast out from among the people there began 
to be a great war among the people, for there were many who rose up, who were mighty men, and sought to destroy Coriantumr by their secret plans of wickedness, of which hath been spoken. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>13:16</b>   And now Coriantumr, having studied, himself, in all the arts of war and all the cunning of the 
world, wherefore he gave battle unto them who sought to destroy him. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>13:17</b>   But he repented not, neither his fair sons nor daughters; neither the fair sons and daughters 
of Cohor; neither the fair sons and daughters of Corihor; and in fine, there were none of the fair sons and daughters 
upon the face of the whole earth who repented of their sins. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>13:18</b>   Wherefore, <span class="a">it came to pass</span> that in the first year that Ether dwelt in the cavity of a rock, there were 
many people who were slain by the sword of those secret combinations, fighting against Coriantumr that they might obtain 
the kingdom. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>13:19</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the sons of Coriantumr fought much and bled much. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>13:20</b>   And in the second year the word of the Lord came to Ether, that he should go and prophesy unto 
Coriantumr that, if he would repent, and all his household, the Lord would give unto him his kingdom and spare 
the people --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>13:21</b>   Otherwise they should be destroyed, and all his household save it were himself.  And he should only 
live to see the fulfilling of the prophecies which had been spoken concerning another people receiving the land for 
their inheritance; and Coriantumr should receive a burial by them; and every soul should be destroyed save it were 
Coriantumr. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>13:22</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Coriantumr repented not, neither his household, neither the people; and the 
wars ceased not; and they sought to kill Ether, but he fled from before them and hid again in the cavity of the rock. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>13:23</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that there arose up Shared, and he also gave battle unto Coriantumr; and he did 
beat him, insomuch that in the third year he did bring him into captivity. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>13:24</b>   And the sons of Coriantumr, in the fourth year, did beat Shared, and did obtain the kingdom again 
unto their father. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>13:25</b>   Now there began to be a war upon all the face of the land, every man with his band fighting for that 
which he desired. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>13:26</b>   And there were robbers, and in fine, all manner of wickedness upon all the face of the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>13:27</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass </span>that Coriantumr was
