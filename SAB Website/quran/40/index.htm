The folk of Noah and the factions after them denied (their messengers)  before these,

Those who bear the Throne, and all who are round about it, hymn the praises  of their Lord and believe

in mercy and knowledge, therefor forgive  those who repent and follow Thy way. Ward off from them 
the punishment of hell.

Have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for  those who disbelieved before them ?

Yet Allah seized them for their  sins, and they had no protector from Allah. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

And Pharaoh said: Suffer me to kill Moses, and let him cry unto his Lord.  Lo! I fear that he will alter your religion or that he will cause confusion in the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Moses said: Lo! I seek refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every scorner  who believeth not in a Day of Reckoning. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

And a believing man of Pharaoh's family, who hid his faith, said: Would ye  kill a man because he saith: My Lord is Allah, and hath brought you clear proofs from  your Lord ? If he is lying, then his lie is upon him; and if he is truthful, then some of  that wherewith he threateneth you will strike you. Lo!

The roads of the heavens, and may look upon the God of Moses, though  verily I think him a liar. Thus was the evil that he did made fairseeming unto Pharaoh,  and he was debarred from the (right) way. The plot of Pharaoh ended but in ruin. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
