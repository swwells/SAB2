<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif">  (6:1-6) In <a href="5.html">the last chapter</a>, Lehi's family spoke in a certain manner of language. In this chapter, 
Nephi says nothing at all.

<p>(6:1-2) Nephi is not going to say anything about the plates that he murdered Laban for, 
except to say that he and his family are descendants of Joseph.

<p><i>"And now I, Nephi, do not give the genealogy of my fathers in 
this part of my record ... For it sufficeth me to say that we are descendants of 
Joseph."</i>

<p>(6:3) Nephi is trying to use as few words as possible, since he is writing on metal plates. 
So it mattereth not to him that he is particulart to give a full account of all the things, etc., etc., etc.

<p><i>"And it mattereth not to me that I am particular to give a full 
account of all the things of my father, for they cannot be written upon these plates."</i>

<p>(6:5-6) So he's not going to write pleasing things; he's going to give commandment unto his seed.

<p><i>"Wherefore, the things which are pleasing unto the world I do not write ... Wherefore, I shall give commandment unto my seed. "</i>
