Jesus gives Nephi the power to baptize, which is kind of weird since Nephi had baptized pretty much everyone already (see 
<a href="1.html#23">3 Nephi 1:23</a>, <a href="7.html#24">7:24-26</a>, and <a href="9.html#20">9:20</a>).

to baptize.  And he said unto them: On this wise shall ye baptize; and there shall be no disputations among 
you.
