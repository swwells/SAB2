    Was it because he or his parents sinned? Jesus said neither had sinned. The man was born blind so that Jesus could show off 
    his powers by curing him of his blindness.<br>
    <a href="../contra/blind.html">Who makes people blind?</a>  
    
<p>(9:1) <i>"Jesus passed by ... a man which was blind from his birth."</i> 
    
<p>(9:2) <i>"His disciples asked him ... Who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?"</i> 

<p>(9:3) <i>"Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be 
made manifest in him."</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif">
<img src="../images/sci1.gif">(9:6-7) Jesus spits on the ground, mixes his spit with
the dirt, and rubs the muddy spit on (or in?) a blind man's eyes. Then he told him to wash in the pool of Siloam. After that, the 
blind man could see again. The Bible doesn't say whether it was the holy spit, holy mud, or holy water that did the trick.<br>
<a href="../contra/spit.html">How did Jesus cure the blind man?</a>

<p>(9:6) <i>"He spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay."</i>
