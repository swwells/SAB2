<p><li>The elect and the damned are predestined by God. <a href="1.html#4">1:4</a>

<p><li>God is planning a messy, mass murder in "the wrath to come" and only Jesus can save you from it. 
<a href="1.html#10">1:10</a>

<p><li>Paul accuses "the Jews" of killing Jesus, persecuting the prophets, displeasing God, and being "contrary to
all men." He concludes that the wrath of God will "come upon them to the uttermost.  
<a href="2.html#15">2:15-16</a>

<p><li>Christians shouldn't mourn the death of their fellow believers. They'll be OK and you'll see them later in heaven. The people you should 
    mourn are dead nonbelievers. They have no hope (because they're going to hell). <a href="4.html#13">4:13</a>
