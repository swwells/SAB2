<p><li>Peter says that their strange behavior (speaking in tongues, etc.) was to be expected since they were living in
"the last days." <a href="2.html#17">2:17</a>

<p><li>In the last days (which Peter believes have already come) God will show great signs 
    and wonders -- things like "blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke." <a href="2.html#19">2:19</a>
    
<p><li>Peter claims that <a href="../dt/18.html#18">Dt 18:18-19</a> 
refers to Jesus, saying that those who refuse to follow him (all non-Christians) must be killed. 
 <a href="3.html#23">3:23</a>
 
<p><li>Ezekiel (<A href="../ezek/26.html#14">26:14</A>,
<A href="../ezek/26.html#21">21</A>; <A href="../ezek/27.html#36">27:36</A>)
prophesied that Tyre would be completely destroyed by Nebuchadrezzar, never to
be built again. Yet it wasn't destroyed, as is evident from this verse.
 <a href="12.html#20">12:20</a>
 
<p><li><a href="../gen/49.html#10">Gen 49:10</a> says that all of Israel's kings will be from the 
tribe of Judah, yet we see in this verse that Israel's first king was from the tribe of 
Benjamin. <a href="13.html#21">13:21</a>

<p><li>Paul quotes God as saying, "I have found David the
    son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my 
    will." But no such quote can be found in the Old Testament. (Although 
    <a href="../1sam/13.html#14">1 Sam 13:14</a> does refer to 
    David as "a man after his [God's] own heart."  And it makes some sense, too, since David was 
    nearly as cruel as the biblical God.) <a href="13.html#22">13:22</a>
    
<p><li>In one of the few times that Paul quotes Jesus, he attributes to him words that are not found in the gospels. 
(It is better to give than to receive.") <a href="20.html#35">20:35</a>

<p><li>Ezekiel (<a href="../ezek/26.html#14">26:14</a>, <a href="../ezek/26.html#21">21</a>; 
<a href="../ezek/27.html#36">27:36</a>) prophesied that Tyre would be completely destroyed by Nebuchadrezzar, never to
be built again. Yet it wasn't destroyed, as is evident from these verses. <a href="21.html#3">21:3-4</a>
<p><li>These verses claim that Moses and the prophets prophesied that Jesus would suffer and rise from the dead.
But in what scripture is such a prophecy made?  <a href="26.html#22">26:22-23</a>
