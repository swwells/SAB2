<p><li> To start off God and Satan's gruesome game, Job's slaves and animals are burned to death or killed with swords. Then Job's 
children are killed in a windstorm while partying. <a href="1.html#13">1:13-19</a>

<p><li>God kills (or allows Satan to kill) Job's children, but Job doesn't "foolishly" blame 
God. Since God was responsible, why would it be foolish to blame God? <a href="1.html#20">1:20-22</a>

<p><li> After God and Satan get done tormenting Job, God gave Job even more stuff than he had before, including 
children. God gave Job another set of 10 kids, with even prettier daughters! <a href="42.html#13">42:13-15</a>
