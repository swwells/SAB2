"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",

"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",

"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.   Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</span>--<a href='30.html#22'>Alma 30:22</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",

"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",

"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>18:2</b>   And when they had all testified to the things which they had seen, and he had learned of the faithfulness 
of Ammon in preserving his flocks, and also of his great power in contending against those who sought to slay him, he 
was astonished <span class="a">exceedingly</span>, and said: Surely, this is more than a man.  Behold, is not this 
<span class="a">the Great Spirit</span> who doth send such great punishments upon this people, because of their murders? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Wouldn't you just know it? The Lamanites (Native Americans) refer to God as "the Great Spirit." (18:2, 3, 
4, 5, 11, 18, 26, 28) 
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>18:3</b>   And they answered the king, and said: Whether he be <span class="a">the Great Spirit</span> or a man, we know not; but this 
much we do know, that he cannot be slain by the enemies of the king; neither can they scatter the king's flocks when he 
is with us, because of his expertness and great strength; therefore, we know that he is a friend to the king.  And now, 
O king, we do not believe that a man has such great power, for we know he cannot be slain. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>18:4</b>   And now, when the king heard these words, he said unto them: Now I know that it is 
<span class="a">the Great Spirit</span>; 
and he has come down at this time to preserve your lives, that I might not slay you as I did your brethren.  Now this 
is <span class="a">the Great Spirit</span> of whom our fathers have spoken. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>18:5</b>   Now this was the tradition of Lamoni, which he had received from his father, that there was a 
<span class="a">Great Spirit</span>.  Notwithstanding they believed in a <span class="a">Great Spirit</span> they supposed that whatsoever they did was right; nevertheless, 
Lamoni began to fear <span class="a">exceedingly</span>, with fear lest he had done wrong in slaying his servants; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>18:6</b>   For he had slain many of them because their brethren had scattered their flocks at the place of water; 
and thus, because they had had their flocks scattered they were slain. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>18:7</b>   Now it was the practice of these Lamanites to stand by the waters of Sebus to scatter the flocks of the 
people, that thereby they might drive away many that were scattered unto their own land, it being a practice of plunder 
among them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>18:8</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that king Lamoni inquired of his servants, saying: Where is 
this man that has such great power? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>18:9</b>   And they said unto him: Behold, he is feeding thy <span class="sci">horses</span>.  
Now the king had commanded his servants, 
previous to the time of the watering of their flocks, that they should prepare his <span class="sci">horses and chariots</span>, and conduct 
him forth to the land of Nephi; for there had been a great feast appointed at the land of Nephi, by the father of 
Lamoni, who was king over all the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/sci1.gif" width="32" height="32">
Ammon had lots of horses an chariots, at a time when neither horses nor chariots existed in the New World.
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>18:10</b>   Now when king Lamoni heard that Ammon was preparing <span class="sci">his horses and 
his chariots</span> he was more astonished, 
because of the faithfulness of Ammon, saying: Surely there has not been any servant among all my servants that has been 
so faithful as this man; for even he doth remember all my commandments to execute them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>18:11</b>   Now I surely know that this is <span class="a">the Great Spirit</span>, and I would desire him that he come in unto me, but 
I durst not. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>18:12</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when Ammon had made ready the horses and the chariots 
for the king and his servants, he went in unto the king, and he saw that the countenance of the king was changed; 
therefore he was about to return out of his presence. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>18:13</b>   And one of the king's servants said unto him, <span class="plag">Rabbanah, which is, 
being interpreted, powerful or great king</span>, considering their kings to be powerful; and thus he said unto him: Rabbanah, the king desireth thee to stay. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,)-- <a href="../../jn/1.html#38">John 1:38</a>
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>18:14</b>   Therefore Ammon turned himself unto the king, and said unto him: What wilt thou that I should do for 
thee, O king?  And the king answered him not for the space of an hour, according to their time, for he knew not what he 
should say unto him. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>18:15</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Ammon said unto him again: What desirest thou of me?  
But the king answered him not. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>18:16</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that <span class="a">Ammon, being filled with the 
Spirit of God</span>, therefore he perceived the thoughts of the king.  And he said unto him: Is it because thou hast heard that I defended thy servants 
and thy flocks, and <span class="v">slew seven of their brethren with the sling and with the sword, and smote off the 
arms of others</span>, in 
order to defend thy flocks and thy servants; behold, is it this that causeth thy marvelings? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/cr1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1">Ammon, being filled with the Spirit of God, brags a bit about killing people with his sling and chopping 
off arms.</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>18:17</b>   I say unto you, what is it, that thy marvelings are so great? Behold, I am a man, and am thy 
servant; therefore, whatsoever thou desirest which is right, that will I do. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>18:18</b>   Now when the king had heard these words, he marveled again, for he beheld that Ammon could discern 
his thoughts; but notwithstanding this, king Lamoni did open his mouth, and said unto him: Who art thou?  Art thou 
that <span class="a">Great Spirit</span>, who knows all things? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>18:19</b>   Ammon answered and said unto him: I am not. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>18:20</b>   And the king said: How knowest thou 
the thoughts of my heart? Thou mayest speak boldly, and tell me concerning these things; and also tell me by what 
power ye slew and smote off the arms of my brethren that scattered my flocks --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>18:21</b>   And now, if thou wilt tell me concerning these things, whatsoever thou desirest I will give unto thee; 
and if it were needed, I would guard thee with my armies; but I know that thou art more powerful than all they; 
nevertheless, whatsoever thou desirest of me I will grant it unto thee. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>18:22</b>   Now Ammon being wise, yet harmless, he said unto Lamoni: Wilt thou hearken unto my words, if I tell 
thee by what power I do these things?  And this is the thing that I desire of thee. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>18:23</b>   And the king answered him, and said: Yea, I will believe all thy words.  And thus he was caught with 
guile. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>18:24</b>   And Ammon began to speak unto him with boldness, and said unto him: Believest thou that there is 
a God? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>18:25</b>   And he answered, and said unto him: I do not know what that meaneth. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>18:26</b>   And then Ammon said: Believest thou that there is a <span class="a">Great Spirit</span>? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>18:27</b>   And he said, Yea. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>18:28</b>   And Ammon said: This is God.  And Ammon said unto him again: 
Believest thou that this <span class="a">Great Spirit</span>, who is God, created all things which are in heaven and in the earth? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>18:29</b>   And he said: Yea, I believe that he created all things which are in the earth; but I do not know the 
heavens. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>18:30</b>   And Ammon said unto him: The heavens is a place where God dwells and all his holy angels. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>18:31</b>   And king Lamoni said: Is it above the earth? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="32"></a>18:32</b>   And Ammon said: Yea, and he looketh down upon all the children of men; and he 
knows all <span class="plag">the thoughts and intents of the heart</span>; for by his hand were they all created from the beginning. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/plag.gif" border="0" width="32" height="32">
The thoughts and intents of the heart -- <a href="../../heb/4.html#12">Hebrews 4:12</a>

<tr><td><b><a name="33"></a>18:33</b>   And king Lamoni said: I believe all these things which thou hast spoken.  Art thou sent from God? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="34"></a>18:34</b>   Ammon said unto him: I am a man; and man in the beginning was created after the image of God, and I 
am called by his Holy Spirit to teach these things unto this people, that they may be brought to a knowledge of that 
which is just and true; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="35"></a>18:35</b>   And a portion of that Spirit dwelleth in me, which giveth me knowledge, and also power according to 
my faith and desires which are in God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="36"></a>18:36</b>   Now when Ammon had said these words, he began at the creation of the world, and also the creation of 
Adam, and told him all the things concerning the fall of man, and rehearsed and laid before him the records and the 
holy scriptures of the people, which had been spoken by the prophets, even down to the time that their father, Lehi, 
left Jerusalem. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="37"></a>18:37</b>   And he also rehearsed unto them (for it was unto the king and to his servants) all the journeyings of 
their fathers in the wilderness, and all their sufferings with hunger and thirst, and their travail, and so forth. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="38"></a>18:38</b>   And he also rehearsed unto them concerning the rebellions of Laman and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, 
yea, all their rebellions did he relate unto them; and he expounded unto them all the records and scriptures from 
the time that Lehi left Jerusalem down to the present time. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="39"></a>18:39</b>   But this is not all; for he expounded unto them the plan of redemption, which was prepared from the 
foundation of the world; and he also made known unto them concerning the coming of Christ, and all the works of the 
Lord did he make known unto them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="40"></a>18:40</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that after he had said all these things, and expounded 
them to the king, that the king believed all his words. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="41"></a>18:41</b>   And he began to cry unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, have mercy; according to thy abundant mercy which 
thou hast had upon the people of Nephi, have upon me, and my people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="42"></a>18:42</b>   And now, when he had said this, he fell unto the earth, as if he were dead. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="43"></a>18:43</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that his servants took him and carried him in unto his 
wife, and laid him upon a bed; and he lay as if he were dead for the space of two days and two nights; and his 
wife, and his sons, and his daughters mourned over him, after the manner of the Lamanites, greatly lamenting his 
loss. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
