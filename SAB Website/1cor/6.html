A believer should not sue another believer in court. Believers are supposed to judge everyone else (non-believers). Heck, some day believers will even judge angels! 
    
<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/2114510.stm">Jehovah's 
Witnesses believe</a> that they should not take another member of their 
church to court. Consequently, JWs who report incidents of sex abuse (or other crime) are often disfellowshipped.

<p>(6:1) <i>"Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?"</i>
