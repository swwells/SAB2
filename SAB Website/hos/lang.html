<p><li> God tells Hosea to commit adultery, saying &quot;take ... a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms&quot; because the land has &quot;committed great
whoredom.&quot; So Hosea did as God commanded and &quot;took&quot; a wife named Gomer.
  <a href="1.html#2">1:2-3</a>
  
<p><li> God (or Hosea?) tells his children that their mother is a whore who is not his wife. He asks 
them to tell their mother to "put away her whoredoms" and  "her adulteries from between her breasts" or 
he'll "strip her naked ... and slay her with thirst." <a href="2.html#2">2:2-3</a>

<p><li>God &quot;will not have mercy upon ... the children of whoredoms. For their mother hath played the
harlot.&quot;  <a href="2.html#4">2:4-5</a>

<p><li> Committing whoredom by going a whoring with the spirit of whoredom. <a href="4.html#10">4:10</a>

<p><li>If you misbehave, God will make your daughters "commit whoredom" and your wife "commit 
adultery." </a> <a href="4.html#13">4:13</a>

<p><li>Even more whoredom! "They have committed whoredom continually." <a href="4.html#14">4:14-18</a>

<p><li>"O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom." <a href="5.html#3">5:3</a>

<p><li>"The spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them." <a href="5.html#4">5:4</a>

<p><li>"They commit lewdness." <a href="6.html#9">6:9</a>

<p><li>"There is the whoredom of Ephraim." <a href="6.html#10">6:10</a>

<p><li> Israel has &quot;gone a whoring&quot; and has &quot;loved a reward upon every cornfloor.&quot; <a href="9.html#1">9:1</a>
