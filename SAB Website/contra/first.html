          upon them twain, and prayed unto the LORD. And he went up, and lay
          upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon
          his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and stretched himself upon the
          child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm. Then he returned, and
          walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself
          upon him: and the child sneezed seven times.

          place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to
          scorn. But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by
          the hand, and the maid arose.

        <DD>Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there
          was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a
          widow: and much people of the city was with her. And when the Lord saw
          her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not. And he
          came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he
          said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise. And he that was dead sat up,
          and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.
