(<a href="../../ex/20.html#4">Exodus 20:4</a>) 

<p><li>Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I

(<a href="../../ex/20.html#9">Exodus 20:9</a>)

        (<a href="../../ex/20.html#10">Exodus 20:10</a>) 

<p><li>For <i>in</i> six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all

        <a href="13.html#19">13:19</a> (<a href="../../ex/20.html#11">Exodus 20:11</a>)

<p><li>Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour <a href="13.html#23">13:23</a> 
(<a href="../../ex/20.html#16">Exodus 20:16</a>) 

<p><li>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not

<p><li>Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed? <a href="14.html#1">14:1</a> 
(<a href="../../is/53.html#1">Isaiah 53:</a>) 

<p><li>For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a
    dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there
    is no beauty that we should desire him. <a href="14.html#2">14:2</a> (<a href="../../is/53.html#2">Isaiah 53:2</a>) 

<p><li>He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with
    grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we
    esteemed him not. <a href="14.html#3">14:3</a> (<a href="../../is/53.html#3">Isaiah 53:3</a>) 

<p><li>Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did
    esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. <a href="14.html#4">14:4</a> (<a href="../../is/53.html#4">Isaiah 53:4</a>) 

<p><li>But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our
    iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes
    we are healed. <a href="14.html#5">14:5</a> (<a href="../../is/53.html#5">Isaiah 53:5</a>) 

<p><li>All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own
    way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. <a href="14.html#6">14:6</a> 
    (<a href="../../is/53.html#6">Isaiah 53:6</a>) 

<p><li>He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is
    brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is
    dumb, so he openeth not his mouth. <a href="14.html#7">14:7</a> (<a href="../../is/53.html#7">Isaiah 53:7</a>) 

<p><li>He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his
    generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the
    transgression of my people was he stricken. <a href="14.html#8">14:8</a> (<a href="../../is/53.html#8">Isaiah 53:8</a>) 

<p><li>And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death;
    because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. <a href="14.html#9">14:9</a> 
    (<a href="../../is/53.html#9">Isaiah 53:9</a>) 

<p><li>Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou
    shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall
    prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand. <a href="14.html#10">14:10</a> (<a href="../../is/53.html#10">Isaiah 53:10</a>) 

<p><li>He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his
    knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their
    iniquities. <a href="14.html#11">14:11</a> (<a href="../../is/53.html#11">Isaiah 53:11</a>) 

<p><li>Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide
    the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death:
    and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and
    made intercession for the transgressors. <a href="14.html#12">14:12</a> (<a href="../../is/53.html#12">Isaiah 53:12</a>) 

<p><li>Him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that
        bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation;  that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth! 
        <a href="15.html#14">15:14</a> (<a href="../../is/52.html#7">Isaiah 52:7</a>) 
        
<p><li>Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice
        together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion. 
        <a href="15.html#29">15:29</a> (<a href="../../is/52.html#8">Isaiah 52:8</a>)

<p><li>Break  forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of

        hath redeemed Jerusalem. <a href="15.html#30">15:30</a> (<a href="../../is/52.html#9">Isaiah 52:9</a>)

<p><li>The  Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the
        nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the
        salvation of our God <a href="15.html#31">15:31</a> (<a href="../../is/52.html#10">Isaiah 52:10</a>)
