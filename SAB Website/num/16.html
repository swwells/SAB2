    title="God's 22nd Killing">14,700 killed for complaining about God's killings</a></b><br>
After God killed Korah, his companions, their families, and 250 incense burners, the people complained saying, "ye have killed the
people of the Lord." So God, who doesn't take kindly to criticism, sends a
plague on the people. And "they that died in the plague were 14,700."<br>

<p>(16:41) <i>"But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, 
<b>Ye have killed the people of the LORD."</i></b>

<p>(16:42) <i>"Behold ... the glory of the Lord appeared."</i>

<p>(16:44) <i>"And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"</i>

<p>(16:45a) <i>"Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a  moment."</i><br>
    God threatens (again) to kill everyone (but his special friends, Moses and Aaron).

<p>(16:45b) <i>"And they fell upon their faces."

<p>(16:46) <i>"Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer ... and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them."</i><br>
    Moses tells Aaron to burn some incense to make God quit killing people. (He just killed 250 for burning incense.)

<p>(16:47) <i>"The plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people."</i>
    
    <p>(16:48) <i>"And the plague was stayed."</i>
    
    <p>(16:49) <i>"<b>They that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred</b>, 
    beside them that died about the matter of Korah."</i>
