<p><li>"Because they have turned their hearts away from me, to worship [other gods]"<br>
God destroys those who worship other gods. <a href="1.html#12">1:12</a>

<p><li>"From Ham, sprang that race which preserved the curse in the land"</i><br>
All Egyptians were (are?) cursed by God because Ham saw Noah when he was drunk and naked. 
(<a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/gen/9.html#20">Genesis 9:20-25</a>) <a href="1.html#21">1:21-24</a>

<p><li>"Pharaoh being of that lineage by which he could not have the right of Priesthood"</i><br>
The Pharaoh was black (according to this verse, anyway), and because of that he was banned from the priesthood. (Poor Pharaoh couldn't be a Mormon 
priest, since all black men were denied the Mormon priesthood until 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacks_and_The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints#Modern_LDS_Church">the 1978 revelation</a>.)
 <a href="1.html#26">1:26-27</a>

<p><li>"The Lord God caused the famine to wax sore in the land of Ur." <a href="2.html#1">2:1</a>

<p><li>"Let her say unto the Egyptians, she is thy sister, and thy soul shall live."<br>
God tells Abraham to ask Sarai to lie to the Egyptians. I guess it's okay to lie. (If it wasn't, God wouldn't have recommended it to Abraham.)
