    (2:1-4) <i>"An angel of the LORD ... said..."</i><br>
    An angel drops by to rebuke the Israelites for being too tolerant of the religious 
    beliefs of the people they have been massacring. He tells them that since they didn't complete their 
    job (of killing everyone), God will not completely drive them out (like he promised to do). Instead 
    he'll keep some of them around so that the Israelites will be ensnared by their false gods. When the 
    Israelites heard the angel's words, they "lifted up their voices, and wept."
    
    <p>(2:1-2) <i>"An angel of the LORD  ... said ... ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice."</i>
    
    <p>(2:3) <i>"Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you."</i>
    
    <p>(2:4) <i>"When the angel of the LORD spake these words ... the people lifted up their voice, and wept."</i>

    <IMG src="../images/int.gif" >(2:11-12) After the angel's visit, the people had a good cry and then got back to what they do best: 
    doing evil in the sight of the Lord. They reject him and follow other gods, "provoking the Lord to anger."

        <b><i>"The anger of the LORD was hot against Israel... and he sold them into the hands of their enemies."</i></b><br>
        God's anger "was hot against Israel, and he sold them." Well, I hope he got a good price. (See <a href="3.html#8">Judges 3:8</a>, 
               <a href="4.html#2">4:2</a>, <a href="6.html#1">6:1</a>, and <a href="10.html#7">10:7</a> where he sells them again.)

  Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for

    were greatly distressed.

  Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the

  And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but <span class="l">they went a whoring
    after other gods</span>, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of
    the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD;
    but they did not so.

  And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge,

    that oppressed them and vexed them.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned, and
    corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to
    serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own
    doings, nor from their stubborn way.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out hastily;
