<p><li> Jacob's parable about the tame and wild olive trees. <br>
This is the longest and most boring chapter in the most boring book ever written (The Book of Mormon). Thirty-one times it came to pass that the trees were cumbered, 
grafted, pruned, plucked, dunged, and digged about for no apparent purpose, except to waste 3733 words. <a href="5.html#1">5:1-77</a>

<p><li>Jacob continues to tell us about Jesus, who will be born 500 or so years in the future. You must believe in him 
  (even centuries before he was born) or you'll burn in hell. This is the umpteenth time Book of Mormon has 
  told us about this. <a href="6.html#1">6:1-13</a>
