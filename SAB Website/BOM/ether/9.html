 <tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>9:28</b>   And there came prophets in the land again, crying repentance unto them -- that they must prepare the 
 way of the Lord or there should come a curse upon the face of the land; yea, even there should be a great famine, in 
 which they should be destroyed if they did not repent. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>9:29</b>   But the people believed not the words of the prophets, but they cast them out; and some of them 
 they cast into pits and left them to perish.  <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they did all these things according to the 
 commandment of the king, Heth. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>9:30</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that there began to be a great dearth upon the land, and the inhabitants began 
 to be destroyed <span class="a">exceedingly</span> fast because of the dearth, for there was no rain upon the face of the earth. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>9:31</b> <span class="a">And there came forth poisonous serpents also upon the face of the land, and did poison many people.  
 And it came to pass </span>that their flocks began to flee before the poisonous serpents, towards the land southward, which 
 was called by the Nephites Zarahemla. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="32"></a>9:32</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that there were many of them which did perish by the way; nevertheless, there were 
some which fled into the land southward. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="33"></a>9:33</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Lord did cause the serpents that they should pursue them no more, but 
that they should hedge up the way that the people could not pass, that whoso should attempt to pass might fall by 
the poisonous serpents. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

of them which fell by the way, until they had devoured them all.  Now when the people saw that they must perish they 
began to repent of their iniquities and cry unto the Lord. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="35"></a>9:35</b>   And it came to pass that when they had humbled themselves sufficiently before the Lord he did send rain 
upon the face of the earth; and the people began to revive again, and there began to be fruit in the north countries, and 
in all the countries round about.  And the Lord did show forth his power unto them in preserving them from famine. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
