<tr><td width="57%"><h3>Judges 7</h3>

<td bgcolor="eeeeee" rowspan="26">

<font size="-1">
  <img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (7:2) After God passed all of Gideon's tests, Gideon and God get down to business. First they need an army.
  Luckily, the Israelite slaves maintained a large, well-equiped army. But the army was too big for God's liking. He worried that if they killed all the Midianites with 
  a big army, no one would believe that it was God that did the killing. And God wants all the credit for his killings.
  
  <p>(7:2) <i>"The LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many ... lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me."</i>
  
  <p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (7:3) So God told Gideon to get rid of some of the men. Start with the chicken shits.
 
 <p>(7:3) <i>"Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart ... And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand."</i>
 
 <p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (7:4-5) And that got rid of 22,000. But 10,000 were still there, which was still too many.  But God had a plan.
 
 <p>God told Gideon to have the soldiers go down to the water to get a drink. Those that lap water "as a dog lappeth" are the 
 natural-born killers that he's looking for, while those that get down on their knees to use a cup or their hands should be sent home to mama.
 
<p>(7:4) <i>"The LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water."</i>

<p>(7:5) <i>"So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth,
 him shalt thou set by himself."</i>
 
<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (7:6-9) So Gideon brought them all down to the water to get a drink. Out of the 10,000 non-chicken shits, only 300 lapped water like a dog. These were the few good men 
that God was looking for. Because God knows that <a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2008/05/real-men-pee-standing-up.html">real men pee standing up</a> and lap 
water like dogs.

<p>(7:6) <i>"And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men."</i>
 
 <p>(7:7) <b><i>"The LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you."</i></b>
 
 <p>(7:9) <i>"The LORD said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand."</i>

<p> <IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (7:12) The Midianites and Amalekites had an infinite number of camels -- well, maybe not quite, but at least as many 
       "as the sand by the sea shore." Which is strange since God killed every male Midianite during the time of Moses, and yet here, 250 or so years later, they 
       flourish like grasshoppers "without number." 
       
       <p>(7:12) <i>"And the Midianites and the Amalekites [were] like grasshoppers for
    multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea."</i>
       
    <p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (7:13-14) 
    Was Gideon worried about attacking a gazillion Midianites with an army of 300 water lappers? 
    
    <p>No, because some guy had a dream about barley cakes and tents. The barley cake smote the tents and -- well, anyway, it was a sign from God that he 
    and Gideon would massacre the Midianites.
    
    <p>(7:13) <i>"There was a man that told a dream unto
    his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley
    bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it
    that it fell."</i>
    
    <p>(7:14) <i>"And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of
    Gideon ... into his hand hath God delivered Midian."</i>
    
    <p><img src="../images/abs1.gif">(7:16-20) Gideon gives each dog-lapper a trumpet and a pitcher with a lamp in it. And tells them to blow 
    their trumpets while breaking their pitchers, yelling "The sword of the Lord and of Gideon." So that's what they did.
    
    <p>(7:16) <i>"He divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers."</i>
    
    <p>(7:18) <i>"When I blow with a trumpet ... then blow ye the trumpets ... and say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon."</i>

    <p>(7:19) <i>"They blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that were in their hands."</i>

    <p>(7:20) <i>"And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, 
    and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon."</i>
    
        <p><IMG src="../images/cr1.gif" >

  Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose
    up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the
    Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the
    valley.    
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="2">7:2</A></B>
  And <span class="a">the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many
    for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves
    against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.</span> 
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="3">7:3</A></B>
  Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever
    is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead.
    And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained
    ten thousand.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="4">7:4</A></B>
  <span class="a">And the LORD said unto
    Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water,</span> and
    I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto
    thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of
    whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not
    go.

  <tr><td><B><A name="5">7:5</A></B>
  So he brought down the people unto the water: <span class="a">and the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that
    lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set
    by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.</span>
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="6">7:6</A></B>
  <span class="a">And the number of them
    that lapped</span>, putting their hand to their mouth, <span class="a">were three hundred men</span>: but all the rest of the
    people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.     
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="7">7:7</A></B> 
  <span class="a"><b>And the LORD said unto
    Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you</span></b>, and
    deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the other people go
    every man unto his place.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="8">7:8</A></B>
  So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent
    all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three
    hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.
       
  <tr><td><B><A name="9">7:9</A></B>
  And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise,
    get thee down unto the host; for <span class="v">I have delivered it into thine hand.</span>
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="10">7:10</A></B>
  But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the
    host:
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="11">7:11</A></B>
  And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be
    strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his
    servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="12">7:12</A></B>
  <span class="a">And the Midianites and
    the Amalekites </span>and all the children of the east lay along in the valley <span class="a">like grasshoppers for
    multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea
    side for multitude.</span>       

  <tr><td><B><A name="13">7:13</A></B>
  And when Gideon was come, behold, <span class="a">there was a man that told a dream unto
    his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley
    bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it
    that it fell</span>, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.    

  <tr><td><B><A name="14">7:14</A></B>
  <span class="a">And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of
    Gideon</span> the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for <span class="a">into his hand hath God
    delivered Midian</span>, and all the host.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="15">7:15</A></B>
  And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the
    interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of
    Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host
    of Midian.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="16">7:16</A></B>
  And<span class="a"> he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a
    trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the
    pitchers.</span>
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="17">7:17</A></B>
  And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I
    come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="18">7:18</A></B> <span class="a">When I blow with a trumpet,</span> I and all that are with me, 
    <span class="a">then blow ye the
    trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword of the LORD,
    and of Gideon.</span>
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="19">7:19</A></B>
  So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outside
    of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set
    the watch: and <span class="a">they blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that were in
    their hands.</span>
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="20">7:20</A></B> <span class="a">And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and
    held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to
    blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.</span>
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="21">7:21</A></B>
  And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the
    host ran, and cried, and fled.
    
      <tr><td><B><A name="22">7:22</A></B>
  And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and <b> <span class="v">the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow</span></b>,
    even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath,
    and to the border of Abelmeholah, unto Tabbath.

  <tr><td><B><A name="23">7:23</A></B>
  And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and
    out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="24">7:24</A></B>
  And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, come down
    against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Bethbarah and
    Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took
    the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan. 
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="25">7:25</A></B>
  <span class="v">And they took two
    princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb</span> upon
    the rock Oreb, <span class="v">and Zeeb <b>they </b>slew</span> at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, 
    <span class="v">and <b>brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon</b></span> on the other side Jordan.
