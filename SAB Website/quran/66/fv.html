<p><li>O Prophet! Why bannest thou that which Allah hath made lawful for thee, seeking to please thy wives?"<br>
Allah says it's OK for Muhammad to have sex with any of his wives whenever he wants. <a href="index.htm#1">66:1</a>

<p><li>Muhammad's wives need to be careful. If they criticize their husband, 
Allah will replace them with better ones. <a href="index.htm#5">66:5</a>

<p><li>The wives of Noah and Lot (who were both righteous) betrayed their husbands and are 
now in the Fire. <a href="index.htm#10">66:10</a>
