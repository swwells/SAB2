  Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the king of

  And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there,

    took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

    princes.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="15">37:15</A></B>
  Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him

  Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him
    secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the LORD? And
    Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand
    of the king of Babylon.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="18">37:18</A></B>
  Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended against
    thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me
    in prison?<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="19">37:19</A></B>
  Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of
    Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="20">37:20</A></B>
  Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication,
    I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to
    the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="21">37:21</A></B>
  Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the
    court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread
    out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus
    Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.
