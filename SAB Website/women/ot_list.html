<p><b><a href="../gen/wom_list.html">Genesis</a></b>

<p><li>God fashions a woman out of one of Adam's ribs. This was necessary since Adam
couldn't find a "help meet" in any of the animals that God made for him. 
<a href="../gen/2.html#20">2:20-22</a>

<p><li>Adam blames Eve and Eve blames the serpent.  <a href="../gen/3.html#12">3:12-13</a>

<p><li><i>"In sorrow thou shalt bring forth children. ... Thy husband ... shall rule over thee."</i><br>
God punishes Eve, and all women after her, with the pains of childbirth and subjection to
men.  <a href="../gen/3.html#16">3:16</a>

<p><li>Adam is also punished, although less severely. He now will have to work for a living because he 
    "hearkened unto the voice" of his wife. <a href="../gen/3.html#17">3:17</a>
    
<p><li>Lamech is the first of a long line of biblical men with more than one wife. It seems
that God approves of such marriages.  <a href="../gen/4.html#19">4:19, 23</a>

<p><li>Finally, sometime in the next 800 years, Adam begat some daughters. These nameless
ones are the first (and nearly the last) girls to be born in the Bible. <a href="../gen/5.html#4">5:4</a>

<p><li>"The male and his female ..." Notice that in the Bible female animals are the property of
male animals, as women are the property of men.  <a href="../gen/7.html#2">7:2</a>

<p><li>Abram makes his wife lie for him, by telling the Egyptians that she is his sister. But at
least it was half-true, since she was his half-sister. Such incestuous marriages are condemned
elsewhere in the Bible, but god makes an exception for Abram and Sarai. (See 
<a href="../gen/17.html#15">Gen.17:15-16</a> where God blesses their marriage.) 
<a href="../gen/12.html#13">12:13</a>

<p><li>Sarai is the first of a long line of barren women who were desperate for children. (In
the Bible, it is the women who are barren, never the men.) She sends Abram into her
handmaid, Hagar, so that she can "obtain children by her." Abram gladly complies. 
<a href="../gen/16.html#1">16:1-4</a>

<p><li>Sarah, who is about 90 years old and has gone through menopause, laughs at God
when he tells her that she will have a son. She asks God if she will "have pleasure" with her
"Lord" [Abraham], when both are so very old. God assures her that he will return and
impregnate her at the appointed time.  <a href="../gen/18.html#11">18:11-14</a>

<p><li>Lot refuses to give up his angels to the perverted mob, offering his two "virgin daughters"
instead. He tells the bunch of angel rapers to "do unto them [his daughters] as is good in your
eyes." This is the same man that is called "just" and "righteous" in 
<a href="../2pet/2.html#7">2 Pet.2:7-8</a>. <a href="../gen/19.html#8">19:8</a>

<p><li>Lot's nameless wife looks back, and God turns her into a pillar of salt. 
<a href="../gen/19.html#26">19:26</a>

<p><li>Lot and his daughters camp out in a cave for a while. The daughters get their "just and righteous" father drunk, and
have sexual intercourse with him, and each conceives and bears a son (wouldn't you know it!). <a href="../gen/19.html#30">19:30-38</a>

<p><li>Honest Abe does the same "she's my sister" routine again, for the same cowardly reason.
And once again, the king just couldn't resist Sarah -- even though by now she is over 90 years
old. (See <a href="../gen/12.html#13">Gen.12:13-20</a> for the first, nearly identical, episode.)  
<a href="../gen/20.html#2">20:2</a>

<p><li>God gets angry with king Abimelech, though the king hasn't even touched Sarah. He
says to the king, "Behold, thou art but a dead man," and threatens to kill him and all of his
people. To compensate for the crime he never committed, Abimelech gives Abraham sheep,
oxen, slaves, silver, and land. Finally, after Abraham "prayed unto God," God lifts his
punishment to Abimelech, "for the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of
Abimelech, because of Sarah."  <a href="../gen/20.html#3">20:3-18</a>

<p><li>God "closed all the wombs" because Abimelech believed Abe's lie. <a href="../gen/20.html#18">20:18</a>

<p><li>"And the damsel was fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her." (Oh
boy!) <a href="../gen/24.html#16">24:16</a>

<p><li>Abraham had several concubines.  <a href="../gen/25.html#6">25:6</a>

<p><li>"She was barren."<br>
In the Bible it's always the woman that are "barren", never the men. And when God "opens their womb," the resulting babies are always little 
boys. <a href="../gen/25.html#21">25:21-26</a>

<p><li>Isaac uses the same "she's my sister" lie that his father used so effectively 
(see <a href="../gen/26.html#7">Gen.12:13</a>, <a href="../gen/20.html#">20:2</a>). 
<a href="../gen/26.html#7">26:7</a>
<p><li>Esau &quot;takes&quot; two wives. <a href="../gen/26.html#34">26:34</a>
<p><li>Esau, who already had two wives (<a href="../gen/26.html#34" >26:34</a>), 
"takes" another. <a href="../gen/28.html#9">28:9</a>
<p><li>Jacob offers to work for seven years to pay for Rachel. As it turns out, he is tricked 
into having sex with her sister, Leah, instead, so he has to work for another seven years so in order 
to pay for them both.  <a href="../gen/29.html#18">29:18-30</a>
<p><li>Jacob is tricked by Laban, the father of Rachel and Leah. Jacob asks for Rachel so
that he can "go in unto her." But Laban gives him Leah instead, and Jacob "went in unto her
[Leah]" by mistake. Jacob was fooled until morning -- apparently he didn't know who he was
going in unto. Finally they worked things out and Jacob got to "go in unto" Rachel, too. 
<a href="../gen/29.html#21">29:21-30</a>
<p><li>As part of the deal with Jacob, Zilpah and Bilhah (Laban's slaves) are handed 
over to Leah and Rachel. <a href="../gen/29.html#24">29:24, 29</a>
<p><li>Laban gives Rachel and Bilhah to Jacob. <a href="../gen/29.html#28">29:28</a>
<p><li>Since Jacob hated Leah, God decided to "open her womb" and make Rachel barren. (Like he did to Sarah and Rebekah.) 
 <a href="../gen/29.html#31">29:31</a>
<p><li>Leah conceives and bears four sons. And it's a good thing, too, since her husband 
hated her until then for not giving him any sons. <a href="../gen/29.html#32-34">29:32-34</a>
<p><li>Give me children or else I die." Rachel considers herself worthless if she cannot produce
children for her husband.  <a href="../gen/30.html#1">30:1</a>
<p><li>But luckily she has an idea. She says to Jacob, "Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her."
She solved the problem the same way as did Sarah (<a href="../gen/16.html#2">16:2</a>). 
<a href="../gen/30.html#3">30:3</a>
<p><li>Leah, not to be outdone, gives Jacob her maid (Zilpah) "to wife." And Zilpah "bare
Jacob a son." <a href="../gen/30.html#9">30:9</a>
<p><li>Leah thinks her husband will honor her now that she has given him six sons. <a href="../gen/30.html#20">30:20</a>
<p><li>And finally, "God remembered Rachel ... and opened her womb. And she conceived
and bare a son [surprise, surprise]." <a href="../gen/30.html#22">30:22</a>
<p><li>"Then Jacob ... set his ... wives upon camels." Jacob had four wives (or two wives and
two concubines -- this distinction is not clear in the Bible): Rachel, Leah, Billah, and Zilpah.
There is no indication that God disapproves of this arrangement. <a href="../gen/31.html#17">31:17</a>
<p><li>Jacob has two wives and two concubines, continuing the biblical tradition of polygamy. <a href="../gen/32.html#22">32:22</a>
<p><li>Laban, Rachel's father, is hunting for the "images" that Rachel had stolen from him.
Rachel sits on the "images" and says to her father, "Let it not displease my lord that I cannot
rise up before thee: for the custom of women is upon me." She knows that no man will come
near her when she is menstruating.  <a href="../gen/31.html#34">31:34-35</a>
<p><li>Jacob has two wives and two concubines, continuing the biblical tradition of polygamy. 
<a href="../gen/32.html#22">32:22</a>
<p><li><i>What did Dinah want?</i>  Did she love Shechem? 
Did she want to marry him? Or did she want him killed? We'll ever know since it was of no 
interest to the biblical author. <a href="../gen/34.html#1">34:1-31</a>
<p><li>Dinah's brothers, to justify the massacre of a town for the rape of their sister, say:
"Should he deal with our sister as with a harlot?" To the author of Genesis, rape is a
crime against the honor of men rather than against a woman.  <a href="../gen/34.html#31">34:31</a>
<p><li>Rachel dies in childbirth; but at least she had another son. And in the Bible, a
woman is expected to die happily as long as she has a son.  <a href="../gen/35.html#17">35:17-18</a>
<p><li>&quot;Reuben went and lay with his father's concubine.&quot;&nbsp; 
<a href="../gen/35.html#22">35:22</a>, <a href="../gen/49.html#4">49:4</a>
<p><li>Esau (Isaac's son) had several wives (continuing the tradition of polygamy, with no
editorial comment from the Bible). <a href="../gen/36.html#2">36:2, 6</a>
<p><li>"And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite ... and he took her, and went
in unto her. And she conceived, and bare a son; and she called his name Er. And she
conceived again [I guess Judah must have went in unto her again] and bare a son; and she
called hi name Onan." (It seems that the probability of having a biblical daughter is
considerably less than 50%.)  <a href="../gen/38.html#2">38:2-4</a>
<p><li>After Judah pays Tamar for her services, he is told that she "played the harlot" and "is
with child by whoredom." When Judah hears this, he says, "Bring her forth, and let her be
burnt."  <a href="../gen/38.html#24">38:24</a>

<p><li>"If any one of the common people sin through ignorance ... then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned."
If a common person sins through ignorance, then kill a female goat. (More important people must kill male goats.) <a href="../lev/4.html#27">4:27-28</a>

<p><li>"He shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD ... a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats."<br>
If you touch an insect, dead animal, or "the uncleanness of man" or if you swear to do something good or bad (5:2-4), kill a female lamb or goat for God. (A female
 will do since it's a minor offense.) <a href="../lev/5.html#6">5:6</a>

<p><li>"She shall be unclean."<br>
Women are dirty and sinful after childbirth, so God prescribes rituals for their purification. 
(And baby girls make them twice as sinful and dirty as baby boys do.)   <a href="../lev/12.html#1">12:1-5</a>

<p><li>"If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days ... And she shall then

<p><li>"She shall bring a lamb ... for a burnt offering, and... a young pigeon, or dove, for a sin offering."<br>
After a woman gives birth, a priest must kill a lamb, pigeon, or dove as a sin offering. This is because having children is sinful and God likes it when things are

<p><li>Miriam and Aaron (Moses' brother and sister) criticize Moses for marrying an Ethiopian woman and thus breaking

<p><li>When one of the Israelite men brings home a foreign woman, "Phinehas (Aaron's grandson) sees them and throws a spear "through the man .. and the woman through her belly."
This act pleases God so much that "the plague was stayed from the children of Israel." But not before 
24,000 had died.  <a href="../num/25.html#6">25:6-9</a>

nothing. Also no mention is made of wives, sisters, or aunts.  <a href="../num/27.html#8">27:8</a>

<p><li>If men make vows, then God expects them to keep them. But a woman cannot make a vow, unless it is "allowed" by
her husband or father. If it is "allowed," then she must keep it -- but even so, she is not responsible 
(her husband or father is). <a href="../num/30.html#3">30:3-16</a>

<p><li>Under God's direction, Moses' army defeats the Midianites. They kill all the adult males, but take the women and
children captive. When Moses learns that they left some live, he angrily says: "Have you saved all the women alive? Kill
every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. But all the women children,
that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves." So they went back and did as Moses (and
presumably God) instructed, killing everyone except for the virgins. In this way they got 32,000 virgins -- Wow!

so that no one would say that a woman had killed him.  <a href="../jg/9.html#53">9:53-54</a>

<p><li>When "the spirit of the Lord" comes upon Jephthah, he makes a deal with God: If God will help him kill the
Ammonites, then he (Jephthah) will offer to God as a burnt offering whatever comes out of his house to greet him.
God keeps his end of the deal by providing Jephthah with "a very great slaughter." But when Jephthah returns, his
nameless daughter comes out to greet him (who'd he expect, his wife?). Well, a deal's a deal, so he delivers her to
God as a burnt offering -- after letting her spend a couple of months going up and down on the mountains bewailing
her virginity.  <a href="../jg/11.html#29">11:29-39</a>

<p><li>Manoah's nameless wife, like so many biblical women, is barren. But an angel fixes that, and Samson is
born.  <a href="../jg/13.html#2">13:2-3, 6, 9</a>

<p><li>"Samson ... saw a woman ... of the daughters of the Philistines ... And Samson said unto his father ... 
Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well." <a href="../jg/14.html#1">14:1-3</a>

<p><li>After ripping up the lion, Samson went to visit the Philistine woman that he fell in lust with earlier. "And she pleased Samson well." 
<a href="../jg/14.html#7">14:7</a>

<p><li>"If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out  my riddle."<br>
    Samson called his wife a heifer. <a href="../jg/14.html#18">14:18</a>
    
<p><li>"But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend." <a href="../jg/14.html#20">14:20</a>
 
<p><li>Samson's father-in-law gave Samson's wife away to a friend, since he thought Samson "hated" her. He suggests
that Samson take his younger daughter instead, saying the younger one's prettier anyway. <a href="../jg/15.html#2">15:2</a>

<p><li>After taking in a traveling Levite, the host offers his virgin daughter and his guest's concubine to a mob of
perverts (who want to have sex with his guest). The mob refuses the daughter, but accepts the concubine and they
"abuse her all night." The next morning she crawls back to the doorstep and dies. The Levite puts her dead body on an
ass and takes her home. Then he chops her body up into twelve pieces and sends them to each of the twelve tribes of
Israel.  <a href="../jg/19.html#22">19:22-30</a>

<p><li>After the Israelites heard the Levite's story (about chopping up his dead concubine and sending her body parts to each 
tribe of Israel) they vowed not to "give" their daughters to the Benjamites. So now they had a problem: they just finished 
killing all the Benjamite women and children (<a href="../jg/20.html#48">Jg 20:48</a>) so there were no women for the surviving Benjamite men to marry. 
[There were 600 Benjamite men that survived the war with the Israelites. (<a href="../jg/20.html#47">Jg 20:47</a>)]  
<a href="../jg/21.html#1">21:1-7</a>  

<p><li>To find wives for the Benjamites (they were unwilling to use their own daughters), the other tribes attacked
and killed all occupants of a city except for the young virgins. These virgins were then given to the Benjamites for
wives.  <a href="../jg/21.html#7">21:7-23</a>

<p><li>Here's what the Israelites decide to do. They will go and kill everyone in Jabeshgilead except for the virgin 
women and give them to the 600 surviving Benjamites. <a href="../jg/21.html#11">21:11</a>

<p><li>So the Israelites killed all the non-virgin women and children in Jabeshgilead, bringing back 400 virgin women 
to give to the Benjamites. But they were still 200 short. Damn! <a href="../jg/21.html#12">21:12-14</a>

<p><li>Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are 
destroyed out of Benjamin?" <a href="../jg/21.html#16">21:16</a>

<p><li>"We may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that 
giveth a wife to Benjamin." <a href="../jg/21.html#18">21:18</a>

<p><li>So they come up with another brilliant plan. Have the Benjamites hide in the bushes and then catch the daughters 
of Shiloh when they come out to dance. So that's what they did and everyone lived happily ever after.  <a href="../jg/21.html#19">21:19-23</a>

Saul had only asked for 100 foreskins, but David was feeling generous.  <a href="../1sam/18.html#25">18:25-27</a>

<p><li>The priest tells David that he and his men can eat the "hallowed" bread if "they have kept themselves at least

<p><li>"David went up thither, and his two wives also." <a href="../2sam/2.html#2">2:2</a>

<p><li>David, by this time, has at least seven wives (Michal, Ahinoam, Abigail, Maacah, Haggith, Abital, and Ehlah),
and he was just getting started.  <a href="../2sam/3.html#2">3:2-5</a>

<p><li>David says, "deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for a hundred foreskins of the 
Philistines." Well, he actually paid with two hundred foreskins 
(see <A href="../1sam/18.html#25">1 Sam.18:25-27</A>). <a href="../2sam/3.html#14">3:14</a>

<p><li>Michal was bought by David with 200 Philistine foreskins 
(<A href="../1sam/18.html#25">1 Sam.18:25-27</A>), then she was "given" 
to Phatiel (<A href="../1sam/25.html#44">1 Sam.25:44</A>), and then "taken back" by David. 
Poor Phatiel must have loved her dearly since he "went along weeping behind her." 
<a href="../2sam/3.html#15">3:15-16</a>

<p><li>"And David took him more concubines and wives." (How many? God knows I suppose, but he doesn't tell us in
the Bible.)  <a href="../2sam/5.html#13">5:13</a>

<p><li>King David dances nearly naked in front of God and everybody. When Michal criticizes him for exposing himself, God punishes her by
having "no child unto the day of her death." Although <A href="../2sam/21.html#8">2 Sam.21:8</A> says that she had five sons (which were sacrificed 
to God by David to stop God from starving people to death). <a href="../2sam/6.html#14">6:14-23</a>

<p><li>David sees a woman (Bathsheba) bathing and likes what he sees. so he sends for her and commits adultery
with her "for she was purified from her uncleanness." She conceives and bears a son (of course).  
<a href="../2sam/11.html#2">11:2-5</a>

<p><li>David tells Joab (his captain) to send Bathseba's husband (Uriah) to "the forefront of the hottest battle
... that he may be smitten and die." In this way, David gets another wife.  <a href="../2sam/11.html#15">11:15</a>, 
<a href="../2sam/11.html#17">11:17</a>, <a href="../2sam/11.html#27">11:27</a>

<p><li>God gave the wives of king Saul to David. <a href="../2sam/12.html#7">12:7-8</a>
<p><li>God is angry at David for having Uriah killed. As a punishment, he will have David's wives raped by his
neighbor while everyone else watches. It turns out that the "neighbor" that God sends to do his dirty work is David's
own son, Absalom (<a href="../2sam/16.html#22">16:22</a>).  <a href="../2sam/12.html#11">12:11-12</a>

<p><li>To punish David for having Uriah killed, God kills Bathsheba's baby boy.  <a href="../2sam/12.html#14">12:14-18</a>

<p><li>After Bathsheba's baby is killed by God, David comforts her by going "in unto her." She conceives and bears
another son (Solomon).  <a href="../2sam/12.html#24">12:24</a>

<p><li>Ammon (David's son) says to his half-sister Tamar, "Come lie with me, my sister." But she resists, so he
rapes her and then sends her away. Tamar, knowing that she now belongs to him (since she was a virgin), expects him
to marry her, but he refuses.  <a href="../2sam/13.html#1">13:1-22</a>

<p><li>Ammon (David's son) says to his half-sister Tamar, "Come lie with me, my sister." But she resists, so he
rapes her and then sends her away. Tamar, knowing that she now belongs to him (since she was a virgin), expects him
to marry her, but he refuses.  <a href="../2sam/13.html#1">13:1-22</a>

<p><li>"And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house."</i><br>
David left Jerusalem because he was afraid that his son Absalom was going to kill him. But he left his 
concubines to fend for themselves.  <a href="../2sam/15.html#16">15:16</a>

<p><li>Absalom "went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel." This was according the God's plan
as announced in <a href="../2sam/2.html#11">2 Sam.12:11-12</a>.  <a href="../2sam/16.html#21">16:21-22</a>
<p><li>To punish his ten concubines for
being raped by his son, Absalom (See <a href="../2sam/16.html#21">16:21-22</a>), 
David refuses to ever again have sex with them and forces them to

like sunny spring days. <a href="../pr/27.html#15">27:15</a>

<p><li>Adulterous women eat, wipe their mouths, and say "what a good girl am I."

<p><li>One of the four things that the earth cannot bear is: an odious woman
when she is married." <a href="../pr/30.html#21">30:21, 23</a>

<p><li>Don't give your strength to women. <a href="../pr/31.html#3">31:3</a>

The Preacher could find a few good men (maybe one in a thousand or so), but not a single good woman.

<p><b><a href="../is/wom_list.html">Isaiah</a></b>

<p><li>Isaiah shows his contempt for women by saying that things have gotten so bad for his people that "women rule over them." 
<a href="../is/3.html#12">3:12</a>

<p><li>God will "smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion" and "will discover their secret parts" since he 
doesn't like the way they dress and walk.  <a href="../is/3.html#16">3:16-17</a>

<p><li>After God takes away the women's jewelry and perfume,  "discovers their secret parts," 
and makes them all bald and stinking, he'll kill their husbands.
Women will then become so desperate that "seven women will take hold of one man, saying ... let us be called by thy name, to
take away our reproach."  <a href="../is/4.html#1">4:1</a>

<p><li>After God "washed away the filth" from the women and killed the men, he set up

<p><b><a href="../jer/wom_list.html">Jeremiah</a></b>

<p><li>Jeremiah insults people by calling them "harlots" who have sex on every hill and 
under every tree. <a href="../jer/2.html#20">2:20</a>
<p><li> God compares Jerusalem's sinful ways to a promiscuous woman, or a wild donkey in heat.  <a href="../jer/2.html#24">2:24</a>
<p><li>  &quot;Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire?&quot; This is meant to be a 
rhetorical question with an obvious answer: Of course not; women think only about their clothes. <a href="../jer/2.html#32">2:32</a>
<p><li> A divorced woman is &quot;polluted&quot; when she remarries. The man, of course, remains perfectly 
clean through it all, even though he was the one who &quot;put her away&quot; in the first place. 
<a href="../jer/3.html#1">3:1</a>
<p><li> &quot;In the ways thou hast sat for them ...&quot; A woman can't even sit anymore without being 
condemned by God. <a href="../jer/3.html#2">3:2</a>
<p><li> Jeremiah loves to insult people. His favorite insult is to call someone a whore. In this verse he 
accuses Judah of having a &quot;whore's forehead.&quot; <a href="../jer/3.html#3">3:3</a>
<p><li>More talk of harlots who have sex under every tree. <a href="../jer/3.html#6">3:6</a>

<p><li>"Thou ... hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree." <a href="../jer/3.html#13">3:13</a>
<p><li> &quot;As a wife treacherously departeth from her husband ...&quot; If a woman leaves her husband, she 
is &quot;treacherous,&quot; but a man is blameless when he &quot;puts her away&quot; for no 
reason. <a href="../jer/3.html#20">3:20</a>
<p><li> God threatens to punish the men by taking away all of their property, 
including their wives, and giving them to others. <a href="../jer/6.html#12">6:12</a>
<p><li>To punish men, God will "give their wives unto others." <a href="../jer/8.html#10">8:10</a>
<p><li> God compares the destruction of Jerusalem to the rape of a woman who deserves to be raped because 
she has sinned. <a href="../jer/13.html#22">13:22</a>
<p><li>God plans to expose Jerusalem's private parts to the world by 
lifting her skirt over her head, so to speak. He's seen her commit whoredoms and abominations and 
whatnot on the hills, and he's getting darned sick of it! <a href="../jer/13.html#26">13:26-27</a>
<p><li>"Have you forgotten ... the wickedness of your wives?" Jeremiah blames it all 
on "the wickedness" of the Israelites' wives. <a href="../jer/44.html#9">44:9</a

Heaven" (Mary?). <a href="../jer/44.html#15">44:15-23</a>

<p><li> The adversary puts his hand upon &quot;all her pleasant things. <a href="../lam/1.html#10">1:10</a>

<p><b><a href="../ezek/wom_list.html">Ezekiel</a></b>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../ezek/wom.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->
<p><li> God sends a &quot;man clothed with linen&quot; to mark the foreheads of the men who will be 
saved. Apparently only men are considered good enough to keep, the others (unmarked 
men, &quot;maids&quot;, little children, and women) are to be slaughtered. God says 
he'll &quot;fill the courts with the slain&quot; and will have pity on no 
one. <a href="../ezek/9.html#4">9:4-11</a>

<p><li>"Woe to the woman that sew pillows ... Behold, I am against your 
pillows." (God likes neither woman nor pillows.) <a href="../ezek/13.html#18">13:18-21</a>

<p><li>God dresses up Jerusalem, 
cleans off the blood that  she was wallowing in, and compliments her on her nice hair 
and breasts.  <a href="../ezek/16.html#6">16:6-7, 22</a>

<p><li>Jerusalem was a harlot who had sex with everyone that passed by. If no one was available, she "committed whoredom" with "images of men."
 <a href="../ezek/16.html#15">16:15-17</a>

<p><li>"Thou ... hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by." <a href="../ezek/16.html#25">16:25</a>

<p><li>"Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, great of flesh." (Jerusalem 
had sex with Egyptians with big penises.) <a href="../ezek/16.html#26">16:26</a>

<p><li>Jerusalem still wasn't satisfied after having sex with the the well-endowed Egyptians (v.26), so she had sex with Assyrians, Canaanites, Chaldeans, 
and complete strangers, but still was not satisfied. So she hired men to "come in unto [her] on every side." <a href="../ezek/16.html#28">16:28-29</a>

<p><li>God calls Jerusalem "an imperious whorish woman." <a href="../ezek/16.html#30">16:30</a>

<p><li>God says that Jerusalem has sex with strangers, hiring them to "come in unto thee on every side."
<a href="../ezek/16.html#32">16:32-33</a>

<p><li>Because she is such a filthy harlot, God will expose her nakedness 
before all of her lovers. <a href="../ezek/16.html#35">16:35-37</a>

<p><li>After exposing her nakedness, God will give her "blood in fury and jealousy" and strip her naked once more. 
Then he'll have her stoned "with stones and thrust through with swords." <a href="../ezek/16.html#38">16:38-41</a>

<p><li> A good man never gets near a menstruating
woman.  <a href="../ezek/18.html#5">18:5-6</a>

<p><li>"They humbled her that was set apart for pollution."</i> <br>
    (They had sex with a menstruating woman.) <a href="../ezek/22.html#10">22:10</a>

<p><li> Two sisters were guilty of &quot;committing whoredoms&quot; by pressing their breasts and 
bruising &quot;the teats of their virginity.&quot; As a punishment, one sister's nakedness was 
discovered, her children were taken from her, and she was killed by the sword. And the fate of the 
surviving sister was even worse: Her nose and ears were cut off, she was made to &quot;pluck off&quot; 
her own breasts, and then after being raped and mutilated, she is stoned to death. 
<a href="../ezek/23.html#1">23:1-49</a>

<p><li>"Their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity." <a href="../ezek/23.html#3">23:3</a>

<p><li>"Thus she committed her whoredoms with them ... with all their idols she defiled herself." <a href="../ezek/23.html#7">23:7</a>

<p><li>"They bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her." <a href="../ezek/23.html#8">23:8</a>

<p><li>"These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword." <a href="../ezek/23.html#10">23:10</a>

<p><li>"Her sister ... was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and
    in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms." <a href="../ezek/23.html#11">23:11</a>
    
<p><li>"And the Babylonians came
    to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom,
    and she was polluted with them." <a href="../ezek/23.html#17">23:17</a>  
    
<p><li>"So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness ... she multiplied her whoredoms." <a href="../ezek/23.html#18">23:18-19</a>

<p><li>Really Big Penises. One of the sister (Aholibah) had lovers
&quot;whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.&quot;
<a href="../ezek/23.html#20">23:20</a>
 
<p><li>"The lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth." <a href="../ezek/23.html#21">23:21</a>

<p><li>"They shall also strip
    thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels." <a href="../ezek/23.html#26">23:26</a>
    
<p><li>"I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen ... Thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in 
derision ... thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow." <a href="../ezek/23.html#30">23:30-33</a>  

<p><li>"Thou shalt ... pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD." <a href="../ezek/23.html#34">23:34</a>  

<p><li>"They came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and
    deckedst thyself with ornaments, And satest upon a stately bed." <a href="../ezek/23.html#40">23:40-41</a>
    
        <p><li>"They went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot." <a href="../ezek/23.html#44">23:44</a>
        
     <p><LI>"And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; 
    because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands." <a href="../ezek/23.html#45">23:45</a>       

<p><li>"Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught." <a href="../ezek/23.html#48">23:48</a>

<p><li>God gets all excited about cooking with "scum" and human flesh, saying "kindle the fire, consume the
flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned. Her scum shall be in the fire." <a href="../ezek/24.html#3">24:3-14</a>

<p><li> God kills Ezekiel's wife and then tells him not to mourn her.  <a href="../ezek/24.html#15">24:16-18</a>

<p><li> God says he will destroy Tyrus. He plans to kill everyone, but he is especially looking 
 forward to killing all of the women. "And her daughters  which are in the field shall be slain by the sword; and 
they shall know that I am the LORD." <a href="../ezek/26.html#1">26:1-21</a>

<p><li>The Israelites were like a menstruating women, so God poured his fury on them.  <a href="../ezek/36.html#17">36:17-18</a>
