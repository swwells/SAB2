<p><li>Jesus "washed us ... with his own blood." <a href="1.html#5">1:5</a>

<p><li>Everyone on earth will wail because of Jesus. <a href="1.html#7">1:7</a>

<p><li>Jesus has "the keys of hell and death." <a href="1.html#18">1:18</a>

<p><li>Repent -- or else Jesus will fight you with the sword that sticks out of his mouth. (Like the limbless knight in
Monty Python's "Holy Grail.") <a href="2.html#16">2:16</a>

<p><li>"I [Jesus] will kill her children with death."  <a href="2.html#23">2:23</a>

<p><li>God gives someone on a white horse a bow and sends him out to conquer people. 
<a href="6.html#2">6:2</a>

<p><li>God gave power to someone on a red horse "to take from the earth ... that they should kill one another."
 <a href="6.html#4">6:4</a>
 
<p><li>God tells Death and Hell to kill one quarter of the earth's  
population with the sword, starvation, and "with the beasts of the earth." <a href="6.html#8">6:8</a>

and tells them to wait until he's done with his killing spree. <a href="6.html#10">6:10-11</a>

<p><li>144,000 Jews will be going to heaven; everyone else is going to hell.

lamb. <a href="7.html#14">7:14</a>

<p><li>"Many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter." <a href="8.html#11">8:11</a>

<p><li>The angels are instructed not to "hurt the grass [how could they? He already had all the grass killed in 8:7] ...
but only those men which have not the seal of God on their foreheads." God tells his angels not to kill them, but rather
torment them with scorpions for five months. Those tormented will want to die, but God won't let them. 
<a href="9.html#4">9:4-6</a>

<p><li>God makes some horse-like locusts with human heads, women's hair, lion's teeth, and scorpion's tails. They
sting people and hurt them for five months. <a href="9.html#7">9:7-10</a>

<p><li>Four angels, with an army of 200 million, killed a third of the earth's population. <a href="9.html#15">9:15-19</a>

<p><li> Anyone that messes with God's two olive trees and 
two candlesticks (God's witnesses) will be burned to death by fire that comes out of their mouths.
 <a href="11.html#3">11:3-5</a>
 
<p><li>God's witnesses have special powers. They can shut up heaven so that it cannot rain, turn rivers 
into blood, and smite the earth with plagues "as often as they will." <a href="11.html#6">11:6</a>

 <p><li>Their dead bodies lie unburied for three and a half days. People will &quot;rejoice over them 
and make merry, and shall send gifts to one another.&quot; After another three and 
half days God brings his witnesses back to life and they ascend into heaven.
 <a href="11.html#8">11:8-12</a>
 
<p><li>When the witnesses ascend into heaven, an earthquake kills 7000 men. This was the second woe. "The 
third woe cometh quickly." <a href="11.html#13">11:13-14</a>

<p><li>Those who receive the mark of the beast will "drink of the wine of the wrath of God ... and shall be

the horses bridles." <a href="14.html#19">14:19-20</a>

<p><li>Seven angels with seven plagues are filled with the wrath of God. <a href="15.html#1">15:1</a>, 
<a href="15.html#7">15:7</a>

<p><li>The seven vials of wrath: 1) sores, 2) sea turned to blood, 3) rivers turned to blood, 4) people scorched with
fire, 5) people gnaw their tongues in pain, 6) Euphrates dries up, 7) thunder, lightning, earthquake, and hail.
 <a href="16.html#1">16:1-21</a>
 
<p><li>God gave the saints and prophets blood to drink. <a href="16.html#6">16:6</a>

<p><li>"They shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire." (Are they going to eat her first and then 
burn her?) <a href="17.html#16">17:16-17</a>

<p><li>To punish her God will send plagues and famine, and "she will be utterly burned with fire." 
<a href="18.html#8">18:8</a>

<p><li>God will send plagues, death, and famine on Babylon, and the kings "who have committed 
fornication with her" will be sad to see her burn. <a href="18.html#8">18:8-9</a>

<p><li>With eyes aflame, many crowns on his head, clothes dripping with blood, a sword sticking 
out of his mouth, and a secret name, Jesus leads the faithful into holy war.
 <a href="19.html#12">19:12-15</a>
 
<p><li>"Come ... unto the supper of the great God." An angel calls all the fowls to feast
upon the flesh of dead horses and human bodies, "both free and bond, both small and great." 
 <a href="19.html#17">19:17-18</a>
 
<p><li>The beast and the false prophet are cast alive into a lake of fire. The rest were killed with the sword of
Jesus. "And all the fowls were filled with their flesh." <a href="19.html#20">19:20-21</a>

<p><li>God will send fire from heaven to devour people. And the devil will be tormented "day and night for ever
and ever." <a href="20.html#9">20:9-10</a>

<p><li>Whoever isn't found listed in the book of life will be cast into the lake of fire. <a href="20.html#15">20:15</a>

<p><li>All liars, as well as those who are fearful or unbelieving, will be cast into "the lake which burneth with fire and
brimstone." <a href="21.html#8">21:8</a>
