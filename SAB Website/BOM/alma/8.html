"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",
"<span class='i'>Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever.</span>--<a href='3.html#14'>Alma 3:14</a>",
"<span class='i'>I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</span>--<a href='3.html#15'>Alma 3:15</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",
"<span class='a'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges ... even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year....</span>--<a href='16.html#1'>Alma 16:1</a>",
"<span class='a'>Their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.</span>--<a href='16.html#11'>Alma 16:11</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",
"<span class='v'>He [Ammon] smote off their arms with his sword; for he did withstand their blows by smiting their arms with the edge of his sword.</span>--<a href='17.html#37'>Alma 17:37</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.   Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</span>--<a href='30.html#22'>Alma 30:22</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",
"<span class='i'>God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.</span>--<a href='30.html#47'>Alma 30:47</a>",
"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Amalekites were of a more wicked and murderous disposition than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='43.html#6'>Alma 43:6</a>",

"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",
"<span class='i'>These dissenters ... became ... more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='47.html#36'>Alma 47:36</a>",
"<span class='a'>God would prosper them in the land, or in other words ... God ... would prosper them in the land.</span>--<a href='48.html#15'>Alma 48:15</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='50.html#22'>Alma 50:22</a>",
"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",
"<span class='i'>The remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty.</span>--<a href='51.html#20'>Alma 51:20</a>",
"<span class='g'>And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye.</span>--<a href='54.html#21'>Alma 54:21</a>",
"<span class='v'>We did slay upwards of two thousand of them after they had surrendered themselves prisoners of war.</span>--<a href='57.html#14'>Alma 57:14</a>",

<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>8:1</b>   <span class="a">And now it came to pass</span> that Alma returned from the land of Gideon, after having taught the people of 
Gideon many things which cannot be written, having established the order of the church, according as he had before done 
in the land of Zarahemla, yea, he returned to his own house at Zarahemla to rest himself from the labors which he had 
performed. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

(8:1, 3, 5, 8, 14(2), 18, 21, 22, 28, 32)
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>8:2</b>   And thus ended the ninth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>8:3</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> in the commencement of the tenth year of the reign of the 
judges over the people of Nephi, that Alma departed from thence and took his journey over into the land of Melek, on the 
west of the river Sidon, on the west by the borders of the wilderness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>8:4</b>   And he began to teach the people in the land of Melek according to the holy order of God, by which he 
had been called; and he began to teach the people throughout all the land of Melek. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>85:</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the people came to him throughout all the borders of 
the land which was by the wilderness side.  And they were baptized throughout all the land; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>8:6</b>   So that when he had finished his work at Melek he departed thence, and traveled three days' journey on 
the north of the land of Melek; and he came to a city which was called Ammonihah. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>8:7</b>   Now it was the custom of the people of Nephi to call their lands, and their cities, and their villages, 
yea, even all their small villages, after the name of him who first possessed them; and thus it was with the land of 
Ammonihah. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>8:8</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when Alma had come to the city of Ammonihah he began 
to preach the word of God unto them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>8:9</b>   Now Satan had gotten great hold upon the hearts of the people of the city of Ammonihah; therefore 
they would not hearken unto the words of Alma. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>8:10</b>   Nevertheless Alma labored much in the spirit, wrestling with God in mighty prayer, that he would pour 
out his Spirit upon the people who were in the city; that he would also grant that he might baptize them unto 
repentance. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>8:11</b>   Nevertheless, they hardened their hearts, saying unto him: Behold, we know that thou art Alma; and we 
know that thou art high priest over the church which thou hast established in many parts of the land, according to your 
tradition; and we are not of thy church, and we do not believe in such foolish traditions. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>8:12</b>   And now we know that because we are not of thy church we know that thou hast no power over us; and thou 
hast delivered up the judgment-seat unto Nephihah; therefore thou art not the chief judge over us. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>8:13</b>   Now when the people had said this, and withstood all his words, and reviled him, and spit upon him, 
and caused that he should be cast out of their city, he departed thence and took his journey towards the city which 
was called Aaron. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>8:14</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that while he was journeying thither, being weighed down 
with sorrow, wading through much tribulation and anguish of soul, because of the wickedness of the people who were in 
the city of Ammonihah, <span class="a">it came to pass</span> while Alma was thus weighed down with sorrow, behold an angel of the Lord 
appeared unto him, saying: <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>8:15</b>   Blessed art thou, Alma; therefore, lift up thy head and rejoice, for thou hast great cause to 
rejoice; for thou hast been faithful in keeping the commandments of God from the time which thou receivedst thy 
first message from him.  Behold, I am he that delivered it unto you. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>8:16</b>   And behold, I am sent to command thee that thou return to the city of Ammonihah, and preach again 
unto the people of the city; yea, preach unto them.  Yea, say unto them, <span class="i">except they repent the Lord God will 
destroy them.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/inj1.gif" width="32" height="32">

God will destroy those who don't repent.</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>8:17</b>   For behold, they do study at this time that they may destroy the liberty of thy people, (for thus 
saith the Lord) which is contrary to the statutes, and judgments, and commandments which he has given unto his 
people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>8:18</b>   <span class="a">Now it came to pass</span> that after Alma had received his message from the angel of the Lord he returned 
speedily to the land of Ammonihah.  And he entered the city by another way, yea, by the way which is on the south of 
the city of Ammonihah. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>8:19</b>   And as he entered the city he was an hungered, and he said to a man: Will ye give to an humble 
servant of God something to eat? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>8:20</b>   And the man said unto him: I am a Nephite, and I know that thou art a holy prophet of God, for thou 
art the man whom an angel said in a vision: Thou shalt receive.  Therefore, go with me into my house and I will impart 
unto thee of my food; and I know that thou wilt be a blessing unto me and my house. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>8:21</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the man received him into his house; and the man 
was called Amulek; and he brought forth bread and meat and set before Alma. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>8:22</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Alma ate bread and was filled; and he blessed Amulek 
and his house, and he gave thanks unto God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>8:23</b>   And after he had eaten and was filled he said unto Amulek: I am Alma, and am the high priest over 
the church of God throughout the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>8:24</b>   And behold, I have been called to preach the word of God among all this people, according to the 
spirit of revelation and prophecy; and I was in this land and they would not receive me, but they cast me out and I 
was about to set my back towards this land forever. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>8:25</b>   But behold, I have been commanded that I should turn again and prophesy unto this people, yea, 
and to testify against them concerning their iniquities. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>8:26</b>   And now, Amulek, because thou hast fed me and taken me in, thou art blessed; for I was an hungered, 
for I had fasted many days. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>8:27</b>   And Alma tarried many days with Amulek before he began to preach unto the people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>8:28</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the people did wax more gross in their iniquities. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>8:29</b>   And the word came to Alma, saying: Go; and also say unto my servant Amulek, go forth and prophesy unto 
this people, saying -- Repent ye, for thus saith the Lord, except ye repent I will visit this people in mine anger; 
yea, and I will not turn my fierce anger away. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>8:30</b>   And Alma went forth, and also Amulek, among the people, to declare the words of God unto them; and 
they were filled with the Holy Ghost. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>8:31</b>   And they had power given unto them, insomuch that they could not be confined in dungeons; neither 
was it possible that any man could slay them; nevertheless they did not exercise their power until they were bound in 
bands and cast into prison.  Now, this was done that the Lord might show forth his power in them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="32"></a>8:32</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they went forth and began to preach and to prophesy 
unto the people, according to the spirit and power which the Lord had given them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
