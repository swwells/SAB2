  Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under
    heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire:
    and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="16">9:16</A></B>
  And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, and
    had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which
    the LORD had commanded you.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="17">9:17</A></B>
  And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake
    them before your eyes.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="18">9:18</A></B>
  And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty
    nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins
    which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him
    to anger.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="19">9:19</A></B>
  For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD was
    wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that
    time also.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="20">9:20</A></B>
  And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed
    for Aaron also the same time.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="21">9:21</A></B>
  And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire,
    and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as
    dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the
    mount.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="22">9:22</A></B>
  And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked the
    LORD to wrath.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="23">9:23</A></B>
  Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and
    possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the
    commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to
    his voice.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="24">9:24</A></B>
  Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="25">9:25</A></B>
  Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell
    down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="26">9:26</A></B>
  I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy
    people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy
    greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="27">9:27</A></B>
  Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the
    stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="28">9:28</A></B>
  Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was not
    able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he
    hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="29">9:29</A></B>
  Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out
    by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
