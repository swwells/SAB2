<p><li>"He [Solomon] spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and
    five." <br>  (I think that beats Willie Nelson.) <a href="4.html#32">4:32</a>

<p><li>"When Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him 
with fire, and died. For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, 
and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin."<br>
Did God force Zimri to burn himself to death? <a href="16.html#11">16:18-19</a>

<p><li>"He laid the foundation  thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his
    youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD."<br>
When Hiel rebuilds Jericho, he lays the foundation with the body of his oldest son and sets up the gates with his
youngest son's body "according to the word of the Lord."<br>
Did God want Hiel to sacrifice his sons in this way? Did he make him do it? What does "according to the word of the Lord" mean here?
