<p><li>God creates light and separates light from darkness, and day from night, on the first day.
Yet he didn't make the light producing objects (the sun and the stars) until the fourth day
(<a href="1.html#14">1:14-19</a>). <a href="1.html#3">1:3-5</a>

<p><li>God spends one-sixth of his entire creative effort (the second day) 
working on a solid firmament. This strange structure, which God calls heaven, is 
intended to separate the higher waters from the lower waters. <a href="1.html#6">1:6-8</a>

<p><li>Plants are made on the third day before there was a sun to drive their photosynthetic
processes (<a href="1.html#14">1:14-19</a>). <a href="1.html#11">1:11</a>

<p><li> In an apparent endorsement of astrology, God places the sun, moon, and stars in the firmament so that they can be used
"for signs". This, of course, is exactly what astrologers do: read "the signs" in the Zodiac in an effort to predict what 
will happen on Earth. <a href="1.html#14">1:14</a>

<p><li>"He made the stars also." God spends a day making light (before making the stars) and
separating light from darkness; then, at the end of a hard day's work, and almost as an
afterthought, he makes the trillions of stars. <a href="1.html#16">1:16</a> 

<p><li>&quot;And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the 
earth.&quot; <a href="1.html#17">1:17</a>

<p><li>Even God gets tired sometimes. <a href="2.html#2">2:2</a>

<p><li>"The tree of life ... and the tree of knowledge of good and evil." <br>
God created two magic trees: the tree of life and the tree of knowledge. Eat from the the first, and you live forever 
(<a href="3.html#22">3:22</a>); eat from the second and you'll die the same day (<a href="#17">2:17</a>). (Or that's what God said, anyway. 
Adam ate from the tree of knowledge and lived for another 930 years or so (<a href="5.html#5">5:5</a>). But he never got a change to eat from 
the tree of life. God prevented him from eating from the tree of life before Adam could eat from the tree, become a god, and live forever.)
<a href="2.html#9">2:9</a>
 
<p><li>God makes the animals and parades them before Adam to see if any would strike his
fancy. But none seem to have what it takes to please him. (Although he was tempted to go for
the sheep.) After making the animals, God has
Adam name them all. The naming of several million species must have kept Adam busy for a
while. <a href="2.html#18">2:18-20</a>

  <p><li>God's clever, talking serpent.&nbsp; <A href="3.html#1">3:1</A></LI>
  
<p><li>God curses the serpent. From now on the serpent will crawl on his belly and eat dust.
One wonders how he got around before -- by hopping on his tail, perhaps? But snakes don't
eat dust, do they? <a href="3.html#14">3:14</a>

<p><li>God curses the ground and causes thorns and thistles
to grow. <a href="3.html#17">3:17-18</a>

<p><li>God kills some animals and makes some skin coats for Adam and Eve. 
<a href="3.html#21">3:21</a>

<p><li>God expels Adam and Eve from the garden before they get a chance to eat from that other tree -- the tree of life.
God knows that if they do that, they well become "like one of us" and live forever. <a href="3.html#22">3:22-24</a>

<p><li>Cain is worried after killing Abel and says, "Every one who finds me shall slay me." This
is a strange concern since there were only two other humans alive at the time -- his parents! 
<a href="4.html#14">4:14</a>

  <p><li>&nbsp;&quot;And Cain knew his wife.&quot; That's nice, but where the hell
    did she come from? <A href="4.html#17">4:17</A></LI>
    

<p><li>The first men had incredibly long life spans. <a href="5.html#5">5:5</a>, 
<a href="5.html#8">5:8</a>, <a href="5.html#11">5:11</a>, <a href="5.html#14">5:14</a>,
<a href="5.html#17">5:17</a>, <a href="5.html#20">5:20</a>, <a href="5.html#23">5:23</a>,
<a href="5.html#27">5:27</a>, <a href="5.html#31">5:31</a>, <a href="9.html#29">9:29</a> 

<p><li>Enoch doesn't die he just ascends into heaven. <a href="5.html#21">5:21-24</a>

<p><li>When Lamech was born, nine generations were alive at once. Adam, Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, Methuselah, and Lamech were all alive at 
the time of Lamech's birth. Adam lived to see his great-great-great-great-great-great-grandson. <a href="5.html#25">5:25</a>

<p><li>When Noah was 500 years old, he had three sons. <br>[Three sons in one year? Was that with one (nameless) wife or 
several?]  <a href="5.html#32">5:32</a>
 
  <p><li>The &quot;sons of God&quot; copulated with the &quot;daughters of
    men,&quot; and had sons who became &quot;the mighty men of old, men of
    renown.&quot; <A href="6.html#2">6:2-4</A></LI>
    
 <p><li>"The LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh."<br>
God shortened the human lifespan to 120 years because humans are "flesh" and he was tired of fighting with them.  <a href="6.html#3">6:3</a> 
    
  <p><li>&quot;There were giants in the earth in those days.&quot; <A
    href="6.html#4">6:4</A></LI>
    
    <p><li>God decides to kill all living things because the human imagination is evil. 
    Later (<a href="8.html#21">8:21</a>), after he kills everything, he promises never to do it again because the human 
    imagination is evil. Go figure. <a href="6.html#5">6:5</a>

  <p><li>God repents. <A href="6.html#6">6:6-7</A></LI>
  
  <p><li>Noah is called a "just man and perfect," but 
he didn't seem so perfect when he was drunk and naked in front of his sons (<a href="9.html#20">9:20-21</a>). <a href="6.html#9">6:9</a>, 
<a href="7.html#1">7:1</a>

  <p><li>God was angry because "the earth was filled with violence." So he killed every living thing to make the 
  world less violent. <a href="6.html#11">6:11-13</a>
  
 <p><li>God tells <a href="../topics/noah.html">Noah</a> to make one small window (18 inches square) in the 450 
  foot ark for ventilation.  <a href="6.html#16">6:16</a>
  
  <p><li>"And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten ... for thee, and for them." <a href="6.html#21">6:21</a>
  
<p><li>Whether by twos or by sevens, Noah takes male and female representatives from each
species of "every thing that creepeth upon the earth." <a href="7.html#8">7:8</a>

  <p><li>All of the animals boarded the ark "in the selfsame day."  <a href="7.html#13">7:13-14</a>
  
<p><li>Noah sends a dove out to see if there was any dry land. But the dove returns without
finding any. Then, just seven days later, the dove goes out again and returns with an olive leaf.
But how could an olive tree survive the flood? And if any seeds happened to survive, they
certainly wouldn't germinate and grow leaves within a seven day period. <a href="8.html#8">8:8-11</a> 

<p><li>Noah kills the "clean beasts" and burns their dead bodies for God. According to 7:8
this would have caused the extinction of all "clean" animals since only two of each were taken
onto the ark. "And the Lord smelled a sweet savor." After this God "said in his heart" that he'd
never do it again because "man's heart is evil from his youth." So God killed all living things
(<a href="6.html#5">6:5</a>) because humans are evil, and then promises not to do it again 
(<a href="8.html#21">8:21</a>) because humans are
evil. The mind of God is a frightening thing. <a href="8.html#20">8:20-21</a>

<p><li>According to this verse, all animals fear humans. Although it is true that many do, it is also 
true that some do not. Sharks and grizzly bears, for example, are generally much 
less afraid of us than we are of them. <a href="9.html#2">9:2</a>

<p><li>God is rightly filled with remorse for having
killed his creatures. He makes a deal with the animals, promising never to drown 
them all again. He even puts the rainbow in the sky so that whenever he sees it, 
it will remind him of his promise so that he won&#39;t be tempted to do it again. 
(Every time God sees the rainbow he says to himself: &quot;Oh, yeah.... That&#39;s right. 
I promised not to drown the animals again. I guess I&#39;ll have to find something 
else to do.&quot;).  <a href="9.html#9">9:9-13</a>

  <p><li>Noah, the drunk and naked.&nbsp; <A href="9.html#20">9:20-21</A></LI>
 
<p><li>God worries that the people will succeed in building a tower high enough to reach him (them?) in heaven, and that by 
so doing they will become omnipotent. <a href="11.html#4">11:4-6</a>

<p><li>God, who is planning another mass murder, is worried that Abraham might try to stop
him. so he asks himself if he should hide his intentions from Abraham. 
<a href="18.html#17">18:17</a>

<p><li>The two angels that visit Lot wash their feet, eat, and are sexually irresistible to Sodomites. 
<a href="19.html#1">19:1-5</a>

<p><li>Lot's nameless wife looks back, and God
turns her into a pillar of salt. <a href="19.html#26">19:26</a></LI>

<p><li>Honest Abe does the same "she's my sister" routine again, for the same cowardly reason.
And once again, the king just couldn't resist Sarah -- even though by now she is over 90 years
old. (See <a href="12.html#13">Gen.12:13-20</a> for the first, nearly identical, episode.)  
<a href="20.html#2">20:2</a>

<p><li>Abraham needed God's help to father Isaac when he was 100 years old 
(<a href="21.html#1">Gen.21:1-2</a>,
<a href="../rom/4.html#19">Rom.4:19</a>, <a href="../heb/11.html#12">Heb.11:12</a>). 
But here, when he is even older, he manages to have six more children
without any help from God. <a href="25.html#2">25:2</a>

<p><li>Esau and Jacob were already fighting each other in the womb. <a href="25.html#22">25:22</a>

<p><li>Esau sold his birthright to Jacob for a bit of bread and a bowl of lentil soup. <a href="25.html#33">25:33-34</a>

<p><li>Isaac uses the same "she's my sister" lie that his father used so effectively on the same king Abimelech. 
(see <a href="../gen/12.html#13">Gen.12:13</a>, <a href="../gen/20.html#2">20:2</a>). 
<a href="26.html#7">26:7</a>

<p><li>Jacob is tricked by Laban, the father of Rachel and Leah. Jacob asks for Rachel so
that he can "go in unto her." But Laban gives him Leah instead, and Jacob "went in unto her
[Leah]" by mistake. Jacob was fooled until morning -- apparently he didn't know who he was
going in unto. Finally they worked things out and Jacob got to "go in unto" Rachel, too. 
<a href="29.html#21">29:21-30</a>

<p><li>Jacob displays his (and God's) knowledge of biology by having goats copulate while
looking at streaked rods. The result is streaked baby goats. <a href="30.html#37">30:37-39</a>

<p><li>Jacob wrestles with god and wins. God changes Jacob's name to Israel to signify
that he wrestled with God and "prevailed." <a href="32.html#24">32:24-30</a> 

<p><li>Unable to beat Jacob in a fair fight, God dislocates Jacob's leg. <a href="32.html#25">32:25</a>

<p><li>God begs Jacobs to let him go, but Jacob says, "Not unless you bless me." So God blessed Jacob and Jacob let God go. 
<a href="32.html#26">32:26-29</a>

<p><li>"What is thy name?" (God didn't know Jacob's name.) <a href="32.html#27">32:27</a>

 <p><li>"Tell me, I pray thee, thy name."<br>
God refuses to tell Jacob his name. (It's a secret.) <a href="32.html#29">32:29</a>

<p><li>"Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew ...."<br>
Jews don't eat the sinew of something or other because God messed with Jacob's leg while wrestling with him. (Now <i>that's</i> a good reason!) 
<a href="32.html#32">32:32</a>

<p><li>Joseph and his magic divining cup. <a href="44.html#5">44:5</a>, <a href="44.html#15">15</a>
