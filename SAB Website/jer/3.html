A divorced woman is "polluted" when she remarries. The man, of course, remains perfectly clean through it all, even
though he was the one who &quot;put her away&quot; in the first place.

<p>(3:1b) <i>"Thou hast played the harlot with many lovers."</i>

Droughts are punishments from God.
    
<p>(3:3b) <i>"Thou hadst a whore's forehead."</i><br>
Jeremiah loves to insult people. His favorite insult is to call someone a whore. 

<p>(3:6) <i>"She is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, 
and there hath played the harlot."</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32"> (3:8a) <i>"When ... backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away,

If a woman leaves her husband, she is "treacherous," but a man is blameless when he "puts her away" for no reason.

  A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping and supplications of the
    children of Israel: for they have perverted their way, and they have
    forgotten the LORD their God.
  <tr><td><B><A name="22">3:22</A></B>
  Return, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings.
    Behold, we come unto thee; for thou art the LORD our God.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="23">3:23</A></B>
  Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the
    multitude of mountains: truly in the LORD our God is the salvation of
    Israel.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="24">3:24</A></B>
  For shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth; their
    flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="25">3:25</A></B>
  We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: for we have
    sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even
    unto this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God.
