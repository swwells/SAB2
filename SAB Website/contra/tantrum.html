    When did Jesus' temple tantrum occur?</CAPTION>
  <TR valign="top"><td>
  
  <dl>
    <p><dt><b><I>At the begining of his ministry</I></b>
    
    <p><dd>This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee ... <br>
        After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days. 
        And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, 
        and the changers of money sitting: And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, 
        and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables; And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; 
        make not my Father's house an house of merchandise. <A href="../jn/2.html#11">John 2:11-16</A>
    
    <p><dt><b><i>The day of his trimphal entry</i></b>
    
    <p><dd>And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way. 	
And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God 
with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen; 	
Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest. <br>	
...	<br>
And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought. <a href="../lk/19.html#36">Luke 19:36-45</a>
    
    <p><dt><b><I>The day after his triumphal entry</I></b>
    
    <p><dd>And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples, 
      Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, 
      and bring them unto me.<br>
      ... <br>
      And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon. And a very great multitude spread their garments 
      in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way. And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, 
      saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.
      ...<br>
      And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, 
      and the seats of them that sold doves, And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a 
      den of thieves. <A href="../mt/21.html#1">Matthew 21:1-13</A>
 
 <hr>
  <p><dd>And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,
        And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, 
        whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.<br>
        ...<br>
        And they brought the colt  to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him. And many spread their garments in the way: 
        and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way. <br>
        ...<br>
        And on the morrow
        ...<br>
        they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, 
        and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves; And would not suffer that any man should 
        carry any vessel through the temple. And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations 
        the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves. <A href="../mk/11.html#15">Mark 11:1-17</A>
