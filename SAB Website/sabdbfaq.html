<b><font size="+2">Skeptic's Annotated Bible Discussion Board Rules and FAQ</font></b><br>
To make this easier to read, we’ll use a FAQ-format.  Consider the answers as “rules.”
<hr>

<p><b>Who can post here?</b>

<p>Anyone, after registering with ezboard. Registration helps reduce spam and 
malicious posting. It also&nbsp; makes it easier to read the 
posts using the ezboard features (like “Mark Forum Read”).
<hr>
<p><b>Is there anything I need to do before I post?</b>

<p>Not really, but for your own benefit, you should probably read some of the SAB itself, 
or read through the posts here at the discussion board.  This will familiarize you with the 
regular posters, recent topics, etc.
<hr>
<p><b>Where should I post?</b>

<p>Generic religious topics, such as free will, or discussion board issues can be posted in 
the General forum.  Specific biblical topics should be posted in the categorical forum 
most applicable (Balaam’s Ass would go in Absurdities, for example).  Current events 
(even those directly related to biblical matters) should be posted in the Religion News 
forum.  Attempts to “save our soul” or general rantings on religion should go in Just 
Preaching.  Anything else - movies, books, politics, etc. - should go in Off Topic.

<p>(Evolution is an exception.  Since evolution and the Science forum are so inextricably 
tied, articles and thoughts on evolution can be posted in the Science forum.)

<p>If you post in one forum and the moderator feels that it is more appropriate 
elsewhere, the post will be moved, but a “shadow” will remain directing people to its 
new location.

<p>If you’re replying to another post, it’s better to click on the “Reply” link under a 
poster’s screen name.  Clicking the “Add Reply” button at the top of the screen will 
throw your post to the bottom of the thread and not under the post to which you meant to 
respond.  This would make it confusing for everyone.
<hr>
<p><b>What about decorum?  Will swearing get me edited or banned?</b>

<p>We have a very free society here.  Freedoms of speech, religion, et al, are embraced.  
Swearing will not get you into any kind of trouble.  Overuse of “colorful metaphors,” 
however, may detract from whatever point you’re trying to make.  Your decision.
<hr>
<p><b>What will get me edited, deleted or banned?</b>

<p>You’d have to be a pretty big jerk.

<p>To be edited, the only situations that come to mind would be if there might be a coding 
error with your post that caused its display to mess up, or making a link active.  It 
hasn’t happened often.

<p>To have a post deleted, … well, we don’t do that for content reasons.  If you’re going 
to say something so monumentally stupid and/or offensive that deleting the post seems 
like a good idea, we’ll probably leave the post there so others can marvel at your 
stupidity/offensiveness.  We do, however, delete duplicate posts or posts that were posted 
in multiple forums without just cause.

<p>To be banned, you would have to be a major spammer or a prolific jackass.  If a post of yours causes a big enough ruckus on the board, or if 
you are being abusive in your tone toward others, you will be admonished by the moderators 
and could have the thread locked down.  Persistent disregard of general decency and 
violations of these rules could, conceivably, lead to your being banned.

<p><dl>
<dt>You will be banned if you:

<dd>Spam the forums.

<dd>Bait and/or engage in persistent, abusive flaming.

<dd>Use multiple logins in an attempt to deceive.
</dl>

<hr>
<p><b>How should I present my arguments or make my points?</b>

<p>That’s pretty much up to you, although there are some good guidelines.  First off, don’t 
preach unless you’re in the Just Preaching forum.  Next, Don’t be condescending or abusive 
in your response to others; this will just turn people off.  Also, if you’re posting 
information from another site or book, please list your sources.  You wouldn’t want to be 
accused of plagiarism and the others may want to see the info you posted for themselves.

<p>Be sure you have at least glanced over recent posts.  You don’t want to retread the 
same old arguments when we just finished a discussion on it a week ago.  Reading old 
threads is the best way to go.  

<!--
<p>I should point out that there are several arguments that believers present so often that 
regulars on the board are, frankly, bored of seeing them.  If you know the terms Pascal’s 
Wager and Occam’s Razor, that’s a good start.  Look for old posts with those phrases in the 
subject line.  Other concepts we’re all too familiar with include Conversion by Fear, 
“Atheists have no morals,” “Evolution disproves God,” and so on.  Also, we aren’t just 
sitting around “bashing the Bible” or talking about why “we hate God.”  We are trying to 
evaluate biblical claims and the believers who posit them in contrast to the world as we 
see it.  On evolution, we’ve just about heard it all.  You may want to consult 
www.talkorigins.org before posting your anti-evolution posts here.  
-->
<hr>
<p><b>What if I have a problem posting or difficulty with another board member?</b>

<p>You can email Steve Wells, the board administrator, or you can send a message to either 
of the board’s moderators, ety3 or ICharlieBrown, by using the ezboard Inbox message 
system.
