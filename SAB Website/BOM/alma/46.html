"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",
"<span class='i'>Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever.</span>--<a href='3.html#14'>Alma 3:14</a>",
"<span class='i'>I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</span>--<a href='3.html#15'>Alma 3:15</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",
"<span class='a'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges ... even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year....</span>--<a href='16.html#1'>Alma 16:1</a>",
"<span class='a'>Their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.</span>--<a href='16.html#11'>Alma 16:11</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",
"<span class='v'>He [Ammon] smote off their arms with his sword; for he did withstand their blows by smiting their arms with the edge of his sword.</span>--<a href='17.html#37'>Alma 17:37</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.   Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</span>--<a href='30.html#22'>Alma 30:22</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",
"<span class='i'>God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.</span>--<a href='30.html#47'>Alma 30:47</a>",
"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Amalekites were of a more wicked and murderous disposition than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='43.html#6'>Alma 43:6</a>",

"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",
"<span class='i'>These dissenters ... became ... more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='47.html#36'>Alma 47:36</a>",
"<span class='a'>God would prosper them in the land, or in other words ... God ... would prosper them in the land.</span>--<a href='48.html#15'>Alma 48:15</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='50.html#22'>Alma 50:22</a>",
"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",
"<span class='i'>The remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty.</span>--<a href='51.html#20'>Alma 51:20</a>",
"<span class='g'>And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye.</span>--<a href='54.html#21'>Alma 54:21</a>",

his name was Amalickiah. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>46:4</b>   And Amalickiah was desirous to be a king; and those people who were wroth were also desirous that 
he should be their king; and they were the greater part of them the lower judges of the land, and they were seeking 
for power. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

him to be their king that he would make them rulers over the people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

his brethren, yea, notwithstanding their <span class="a">exceedingly</span> great care over the church, for they 
were high priests over the church. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>46:7</b>   And there were many in the church who believed in the flattering words of Amalickiah, therefore 
they dissented even from the church; and thus were the affairs of the people of Nephi <span class="a">exceedingly</span> 
precarious and dangerous, notwithstanding their great victory which they had had over the Lamanites, and their great 
rejoicings which they had had <span class="i">because of their deliverance by the hand of the Lord.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

iniquity, and to be led away by the evil one. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>46:9</b>   Yea, and we also see the great wickedness one very wicked man can cause to take place among the 
children of men. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>46:10</b>   Yea, we see that Amalickiah, because he was a man of cunning device and a man of many flattering 
words, that he led away the hearts of many people to do wickedly; yea, and to seek to destroy the church of God, 
and to destroy the foundation of liberty which God had granted unto them, or which blessing God had sent upon the 
face of the land for the righteous' sake. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>46:11</b>   <span class="a">And now it came to pass</span> that when Moroni, who was the chief commander of the armies of the 
Nephites, had heard of these dissensions, he was angry with Amalickiah. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>46:12</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that he rent his coat; and he took 
a piece thereof, and wrote upon it -- In memory of our God, our religion, and freedom, and our peace, our wives, and 
our children -- and he fastened it upon the end of a pole. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>46:13</b>   And he fastened on his head-plate, and his breastplate, and his shields, and girded on his 
armor about his loins; and he took the pole, which had on the end thereof his rent coat, (and he called it 
the title of liberty) and he bowed himself to the earth, and he prayed mightily unto his God for the blessings 
of liberty to rest upon his brethren, so long as there should a band of <span class="a">Christians</span> remain to possess the l

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32"><br>
<font size="-1">The Nephites were all "Christians", "true believers of Christ" -- 73 or so years before Christ was born, 
and well over 100 years before the Bible (<a href="../../acts/11.html#26">Acts 11:26</a>) claims the followers of 
Christ were first called "Christians".

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>46:14</b>   For <span class="a">thus were all the true believers of Christ</span>, who belonged to the church of God, called 
by those who did not belong to the church. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>46:15</b>   And those who did belong to the church were faithful; yea, <span class="a">all those who were 
true believers in Christ took upon them, gladly, the name of Christ, or Christians as they were called, because of their belief 
in Christ who should come.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>46:16</b>   And therefore, at this time, Moroni prayed that the cause of the Christians, and the freedom 
of the land might be favored. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>46:17</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when he had poured out his soul to God, he named 
all the land which was south of the land Desolation, yea, and in fine, all the land, both on the north and on 
the south -- A chosen land, and the land of liberty. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>46:18</b>   And he said: Surely God shall not suffer that we, who are despised because we take upon us the 
name of Christ, shall be trodden down and destroyed, until we bring it upon us by our own transgressions. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>46:19</b>   And when Moroni had said these words, he went forth among the people, waving the rent part of 
his garment in the air, that all might see the writing which he had written upon the rent part, and crying with 
a loud voice, saying: <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>46:20</b>   Behold, whosoever will maintain this title upon the land, let them come forth in the strength 
of the Lord, and enter into a covenant that they will maintain their rights, and their religion, that the Lord 
God may bless them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>46:21</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when Moroni had proclaimed these words, 
behold, the people came running together with their armor girded about their loins, rending their garments 
in token, or as a covenant, that they would not forsake the Lord their God; or, in other words, <span class="i">if they should 
transgress the commandments of God, or fall into transgression, and be ashamed to take upon them the name of 
Christ, the Lord should rend them even as they had rent their garments. </span><td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">If the Nephites forsake God, then God will tear them to pieces.

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>46:22</b>   <span class="i">Now this was the covenant which they made, and they cast their garments at the feet of Moroni, 
saying: We covenant with our God, that we shall be destroyed, even as our brethren in the land northward, if we 
shall fall into transgression</span>; yea, he may cast us at the feet of our enemies, even as we have cast our garments 
at thy feet to be trodden under foot, if we shall fall into transgression. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">The Nephites make a deal with God. If they fail to follow God properly, then God can kill them all.

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>46:23</b>   Moroni said unto them: Behold, we are a remnant of the seed of Jacob; yea, we are a remnant of 
the seed of Joseph, whose coat was rent by his brethren into many pieces; yea, and now behold, let us remember 
to keep the commandments of God, or our garments shall be rent by our brethren, and we be cast into prison, or 
be sold, or be slain. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>46:24</b>   Yea, let us preserve our liberty as a remnant of Joseph; yea, let us remember the words of 
Jacob, before his death, for behold, he saw that a part of the remnant of the coat of Joseph was preserved 
and had not decayed.  And he said -- Even as this remnant of garment of my son hath been preserved, so shall 
a remnant of the seed of my son be preserved by the hand of God, and be taken unto himself, while the remainder 
of the seed of Joseph shall perish, even as the remnant of his garment. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>46:25</b>   Now behold, this giveth my soul sorrow; nevertheless, my soul hath joy in my son, because 
of that part of his seed which shall be taken unto God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>46:26</b>   Now behold, this was the language of Jacob. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>46:27</b>   And now who knoweth but what 
the remnant of the seed of Joseph, which shall perish as his garment, are those who have dissented from us?  
Yea, and even it shall be ourselves if we do not stand fast in the faith of Christ. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>46:28</b>   <span class="a">And now it came to pass</span> that when Moroni had said these words he went forth, and also sent 
forth in all the parts of the land where there were dissensions, and gathered together all the people who were 
desirous to maintain their liberty, to stand against Amalickiah and those who had dissented, who were called 
Amalickiahites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>46:29</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when Amalickiah saw that the people of 
Moroni were more numerous than the Amalickiahites -- and he also saw that his people were doubtful concerning 
the justice of the cause in which they had undertaken -- therefore, fearing that he should not gain the point, 
he took those of his people who would and departed into the land of Nephi. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>46:30</b>   Now Moroni thought it was not expedient that the Lamanites should have any more strength; 
therefore he thought to cut off the people of Amalickiah, or to take them and bring them back, and put 
Amalickiah to death; yea, for he knew that he would stir up the Lamanites to anger against them, and cause 
them to come to battle against them; and this he knew that Amalickiah would do that he might obtain his purposes. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>46:31</b>   Therefore Moroni thought it was expedient that he should take his armies, who had gathered 
themselves together, and armed themselves, and entered into a covenant to keep the peace -- <span class="a">And it 
came to pass</span> that he took his army and marched out with his tents into the wilderness, to cut off the course o
f Amalickiah in the wilderness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="32"></a>46:32</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that he did according to his desires, and marched forth 
into the wilderness, and headed the armies of Amalickiah. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="33"></a>46:33</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Amalickiah fled with a small number of his men, 
and the remainder were delivered up into the hands of Moroni and were taken back into the land of Zarahemla. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="34"></a>46:34</b>   Now, Moroni being a man who was appointed by the chief judges and the voice of the people, therefore 
he had power according to his will with the armies of the Nephites, to establish and to exercise authority over 
them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="35"></a>46:35</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that 
<span class="i">whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not 
enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be 
put to death</span>; and there were but few who denied the covenant of freedom. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">Those who will not support the cause of freedom are put to death. (The Bush Doctrine?)

<tr><td><b><a name="36"></a>46:36</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> also, that he caused the title of liberty to be hoisted 
upon every tower which was in all the land, which was possessed by the Nephites; and thus Moroni planted the 
standard of liberty among the Nephites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="37"></a>46:37</b>   And they began to have peace again in the land; and thus they did maintain peace in the land until 
nearly the end of the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="38"></a>46:38</b>   And Helaman and the high priests did also maintain order in the church; yea, even for the space 
of four years did they have much peace and rejoicing in the church. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="39"></a>46:39</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that there were many who died, firmly believing that 
their souls were redeemed by the Lord Jesus Christ; thus they went out of the world rejoicing. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="40"></a>46:40</b>   And there were some who died with fevers, which at some seasons of the year were very frequent 
in the land -- but not so much so with fevers, because of the excellent qualities of the many plants and roots 
which God had prepared to remove the cause of diseases, to which men were subject by the nature of the climate --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="41"></a>46:41</b>   But there were many who died with old age; and those who died in the faith of Christ are happy in him, 
as we must needs suppose. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
