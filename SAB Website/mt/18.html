it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire."</i>

<p>(18:9) <i>"<b>If thine eye offend thee, pluck it out</b>, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, 
rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire."</i>

<p><img src="../images/interp.gif" > (18:15-17) Jehovah's Witnesses use these verses 
(along with <a href="../dt/19.html#15">Dt.19:15</a> and <a href="../1tim/5.html#19">1 Tim.5:19</a>) 
to justify their refusal to report or investigate incidents of child molestation unless two or three 
JWs have witnessed the event. If witnesses do not come forward (and they are discouraged from doing 
so since it would embarrass the organization), then the victim is told to be quiet about it.

<p>(18:15) <i>"If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: 
if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother."</i>

<p>(18:16) <i>"But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of 
two or three witnesses every word may be established."</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif">(18:19) <i>"If two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask,

<p>(18:21) <i>"Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?"</i>

<p>(18:22) <i>"Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven."</i>

<p>"In the Bible it says they asked Jesus how many times you should forgive, and he said 70 times 7. Well, I want you all to know that I'm

In the parable of the unforgiving servant, the king threatens to enslave a man and his entire 
family to pay for a debt. The servant begs for the king's mercy, and the king forgives his entire debt. But then the same servant found a fellow servant that 
owed him some money, and he demanded payment. The servant begged for mercy but was thrown 
in prison instead. Other servants heard about it, and they told the king, who had the unforgiving servant tortured.

<p>The parable ends with this: "So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you." 

<p>If you are cruel to others, God will be cruel to you.

<p>(18:23) <i>"Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which
    would take account of his servants."</i>
    
<p>(18:25) <i>"But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, 
and payment to be made."</i> (This is the king speaking, who is likened to "the kingdom of heaven" by Jesus.)
