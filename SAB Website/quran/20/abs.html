<p><li>Moses turns his staff into a serpent. <a href="index.htm#18">20:18-20</a> 

<p><li>The golden (or saffron-colored) calf mooed. <a href="index.htm#88">20:88</a> 

<p><li>"We have revealed it [the Quran] as a Lecture in Arabic."<br>
Then why are there so many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Syro-Aramaic_Reading_of_the_Koran">non-Arabic words and sources</a> for it? 
And why would God prefer one language over another? Is he the tribal god of the Arabs? <a href="index.htm#113">20:113</a>

<p><li>In Genesis (<a href="../../gen/3.html#22">3:22-24</a>), Adam and Eve are driven out of the Garden of 
Eden before eating from the "Tree of Life" and thereby becoming immortal. But here they eat from 
"the tree of immortality and power" -- yet they don't become immortal or powerful, they become ashamed 
of their nakedness. Why? <a href="index.htm#120">20:120-1</a>
