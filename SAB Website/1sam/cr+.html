<p><li>"The Lord killeth ..." -- every chance he gets.  <a href="2.html#6">2:6</a>, <a href="2.html#25">2:25</a>

<p><li>"The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them." If God doesn't
like you, he'll send a thunderstorm your way to break your body into little pieces.  <a href="2.html#10">2:10</a>

<p><li>God will kill those who sin against him. <a href="2.html#25">2:25</a>

<p><li>If you piss him off, God will cut off your arm, consume your eyes, grieve your heart, and kill your sons and
grandfathers.  <a href="2.html#31">2:31-34</a>

<p><li>God will punish Eli's descendants forever for the sins of Eli's sons. <a href="3.html#12">3:12-13</a>

<p><li>God smites the people of Ashdod with hemorrhoids "in their secret parts."  
<a href="5.html#6">5:6-12</a>

<p><li>God kills 50,070 men for looking into the ark. "And the people lamented, because the Lord had smitten many of
the people with a great slaughter." <a href="6.html#19">6:19</a>

<p><li>"I make a covenant with your, that I may thrust out all your right eyes." Deals like this can only be found in the
Bible.  <a href="11.html#2">11:2</a>

<p><li>"And the spirit of God came upon Saul ... and he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them
throughout all the coast of Israel." People do the darnedest
things when the spirit of God comes upon them!  <a href="11.html#6">11:6-7</a>

<p><li>God delivers the Philistines into Jonathan's hand. And his very "first slaughter ... was about twenty men."
Not bad for a first slaughter.  <a href="14.html#12">14:12</a>

<p><li>Under God's influence, the Philistines killed each other.  <a href="14.html#20">14:20</a>

<p><li>God orders Saul to kill all of the Amalekites: men, women, infants, sucklings, ox, sheep, camels, and asses.
Why? Because God remembers what Amalek did hundreds of years ago.  <a href="15.html#2">15:2-3</a>

<p><li>Saul killed everyone but Agag (the king) and the best of the animals. But still God was furious with Saul for
not killing everything as he had been told to do. He said, "it repenteth me that I have set Saul up to be king." 
 <a href="15.html#7">15:7-26</a>
 
 <p><li>Saul is rebuked by Samuel for "doing evil in the sight of the Lord" by failing to kill all of the 
Amalekites. <a href="15.html#18">15:18-19</a>

<p><li>Because Saul didn't kill everyone as God commanded, God changes his mind about him 
being king. <a href="15.html#23">15:23-26</a>

<p><li> To please God, Samuel hacks Agag in pieces "before the Lord" [I bet God enjoyed that!] -- after Agag
pleads with him saying, "surely the bitterness of death has past."  <a href="15.html#32">15:32-34</a>

<p><li>After God rejects Saul for refusing to kill
indiscriminately, he sends Samuel to find another king. David is chosen and
anointed by Samuel, and "<I>the spirit of the Lord came upon him from that
day forward</I>." <a href="16.html#13">16:13</a>

<p><li>The evil spirit from the Lord</i><br>"But the spirit of the Lord
departed from Saul [since he was not murderous enough for God], and an <I>evil
spirit from the Lord</I> troubled him." But if God is good, then how could
he have an evil spirit? <a href="16.html#14">16:14-16, 23</a>

<p><li>David and Saul have a contest to see who can kill the most people for God, and the women act as
cheerleaders saying, "Saul has killed his thousands, and David his tens of thousands."  
<a href="18.html#6">18:6-7</a>, <a href="21.html#11">21:11</a>, <a href="29.html#5">29:5</a>

<p><li>David kills 200 Philistines and brings their foreskins to Saul to buy his first wife (Saul's daughter Michal).
Saul had only asked for 100 foreskins, but David was feeling generous.  <a href="18.html#25">18:25-27</a>

<p><li>"David inquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the Lord said unto David, Go,
and smite the Philistines ... So David smote them with a great slaughter."  
<a href="23.html#2">23:2-5</a>

<p><li>David vows to kill "any that pisseth against the wall." <a href="25.html#22">25:22, 34</a>

<p><li>"And it came to pass about ten days after, that the Lord smote Nabal, that he died." This was convenient for
David who then took his property and his wife, Abigail.  <a href="25.html#38">25:38</a>

<p><li> "And David smote the land and left neither man nor woman alive." (No wonder God liked David so much!)
<a href="27.html#8">27:8-11</a>

<p><li>Saul visits a woman with a "familiar spirit" and she brings Samuel back from the dead. Samuel once again
explains that God is angry at Saul for not killing all of the Amalekites. He says God is going to deliver all of Israel
into the hands of the Philistines. (Since Saul refused to slaughter innocent people, God will slaughter the Israelites.
Fair is fair.)  <a href="28.html#8">28:8-19</a>
