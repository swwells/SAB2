<h4>Saul has killed his thousands, and David his ten thousands</h4>

<p>Welcome, everyone. 

<p>The text for today's sermon is <a href="18.html#6">1 Sam.18:6-9</a>.

<p>"And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out 
of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick. And 
the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands. And Saul
was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have 
ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom? And Saul eyed David from that day and forward."

<p>At the time that these events took place, David was a young man who had only recently been chosen and anointed by 
God (<a href="16.html#12">1 Sam.16:12-13</A>). From that moment on, though, David was God's special hero, for the Bible 
says that "the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward."

<p>Saul, too, was impressed with David, especially after seeing him kill the ten-foot-tall Goliath 
(<a href="17.html#4">1 Sam.17:4</a>) with just a sling and a stone. But when the dancing girls praised David for 
killing tens of thousands, while saying that Saul had only killed thousands, it was simply more than he could bear. 

<p>It wasn't that Saul couldn't compete with David in the number-of-people-killed category. Saul was one of the all time 
leading killers. One of his first acts, for example, after being anointed by God, was to hack a yoke of oxen into pieces, 
sending the bloody pieces throughout Israel (<a href="11.html#6">1 Sam.11:6-7</a>). He did this marvelous act after 
"the Spirit of the Lord came upon him." In this way "the fear of the Lord" came upon all the people. 

<p>Well, okay, that was oxen, not people. But Saul could kill people too. In fact, the reason he killed the oxen was to force 
the Israelites to kill Ammonites. You see, when each tribe got a piece of a dead ox in the mail, they'd know it was a call 
to war. And if they refused to come, Saul would chop up their oxen - or worse.

<p>And it worked too. Saul got 330,000 soldiers to enlist in his war against the Ammonites. 
(<a href="11.html#8">1 Sam.11:8</a>) That’s more than both Blair and Bush have in Iraq! Maybe dubbya should've sent 
some chopped up oxen to the UN Security Council members. I bet the French would have loved it. 

<p>Anyway, the war turned out great. It only lasted a few hours or so with the Israelites killing the Ammonites "until the 
heat of the day." Only a few Ammonites survived the day's slaughter, and although the bible doesn't tell us how many were 
killed, Saul must have racked up tens of thousands on that glorious day. (<a href="11.html#11">1 Sam.11:11</a>)

<p>The bible tells us that Saul continued to kill people throughout his reign (<a href="14.html#47">1 Sam.14:47-48</a>). 
Besides the Ammonites, he killed the people of Moab, Edom, and Zobah. And as for the Philistines, wherever he went, "he 
vexed them." But he really outdid himself with the Amalekites. He killed enough of them to satisfy everyone. Everyone, 
but God, that is.

<p>For some reason, God really hates Amalekites. Way back in Exodus he said, "The Lord has sworn that the Lord will have war 
with Amalek from generation to generation." And I guess he meant it, because in <a href="15.html#3">1 Sam.15:3</a>, 
hundreds of years later, God orders Saul to kill every Amalekite, "both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, 
camel and ass." 

<p>Now killing women and children was no big deal to a world-class killer like Saul. Yet somehow, in a moment of ungodly 
weakness, he let the Amalekite king, Agag, and some of the animals, live. He killed everyone else, though - every man, woman, and child, just as God commanded.

<p>But God never forgave Saul for that single act of mercy. He had told Saul to "Go and utterly destroy the sinners the 
Amalekites," and yet he did "not obey the voice of the LORD." Because Saul rejected the word of the LORD, God rejected Saul 
from being king.

<p>Then David came along and God knew he'd finally found his killer-king. 

<p>And David didn't disappoint him either. One of his first acts, for example, was to kill 200 Philistines, and cut off 
their foreskins to pay for his first wife. (<a href="18.html#27">1 Sam.18:27</a>) 
Can you&nbsp; imagine how pleased God must have been as he watched 
David kill and mutilate the uncircumcised Philistines? I'll bet he still watches the whole thing over and over again on video 
tape.

<p>But David was just getting started. Later he, with God's permission, &quot;smote 
the Philistines with a great slaughter&quot; (<a href="23.html#2">1 Sam.23:2-4</a>); vowed to kill everyone 
that &quot;pissed against the wall&quot; (<a href="25.html#22">1 Sam.25:22</a>); &quot;smote the land leaving neither man nor woman 
alive&quot; (<a href="27.html#8">1 Sam.27:8-11</a>); ordered his henchman to cut off the hands and feet of his 
prisoners and &quot;hang them up over the pool in Hebron.&quot; (<a href="../2sam/4.html#12">2 Sam.4:12</a>). For he was, as 
Paul said, a man after God's own heart (Acts 13:22).

<p>So poor Saul never had a chance. As he listened to the women's song, he knew that he wold lose his kingdom to the young 
killer-king David. Which, of course, he did.

<p>But there's a message here for today's Christians. How would David handle the war in Iraq? As soon as bible believers 
answer than question they can begin to sing openly and joyously that "Blair has killed his thousands, and Bush his tens 
of thousands."
