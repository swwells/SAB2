  But fear not thou, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O Israel: for,
    behold, I will save thee from afar off, and thy seed from the land of their
    captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be in rest and at ease, and none
    shall make him afraid.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the LORD: for I am with thee; for
    I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee: but I
    will not make a full end of thee, but correct thee in measure; yet will I
    not leave thee wholly unpunished.
