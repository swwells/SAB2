    After the Israelites heard the Levite's story (about chopping up his dead concubine and 
    sending her body parts to each tribe of Israel) they vowed not to "give" their daughters to the Benjamites. So now they had a problem: 
    they just finished killing all the Benjamite women and children (<a href="20.html#48">Jg 20:48</a>) so there were no women for the surviving Benjamite men to marry. 
    [There were 600 Benjamite men that survived the war with the Israelites. (<a href="20.html#47">Jg 20:47</a>)]
    
    <p>(21:1) <i>"The men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife."</i>
    
    <p>(21:7) <i>"How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD 
    that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?"</i>
    
 <p><img src="../images/abs1.gif">
     <img src="../images/inj1.gif"> (21:8-11) But they find a great solution. They check their records and find that no one from Jabeshgilead came to the rotting-concubine-
    body-part meeting. So they go and kill everyone in Jabeshgilead except for the virgin women and give them to the 600 surviving Benjamites.
    
    <p>(21:8) <i>"What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up
    to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came none to the camp from
    Jabeshgilead."</i>
    
    <p>(21:10) <i>"And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, 
    and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children."</i>
    
      <p>(21:11) <i>"Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man."</i>

     So the Israelites killed all the non-virgin women and children in Jabeshgilead, bringing back 400 virgin women to give to the 
     Benjamites. But they were still 200 short. Damn!   <br>

      So they come up with another brilliant plan. Have the Benjamites hide in the bushes and then catch the daughters of Shiloh when they 
      come out to dance. So that's what they did and everyone lived happily ever after.<br>
