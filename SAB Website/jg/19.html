host offers his virgin daughter and his guest's concubine to a mob of perverts
(who want to have sex with his guest). The mob refuses the daughter, but accepts
the concubine and they "abuse her all night." The next morning she
crawls back to the doorstep. The Levite puts her body on an ass
and takes it home. Then he chops the body up into twelve pieces 
(<a href="http://reannotated.blogspot.com/2008/08/now-will-we-deal-worse-with-thee-than.html">while still alive?</a>) and sends them
to each of the twelve tribes of Israel (Parcel Post?). The story, which must be
one of the most disgusting stories ever told, ends with: "consider of it,
take advice, and speak your mind." Those who do consider it will
immediately reject the idea that the Bible is inspired by God. Hopefully, they
then will speak their mind.
