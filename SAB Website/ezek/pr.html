<p><li>"Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy." <a href="13.html#2">13:2</a>

<p><li> God deceives some of his prophets and then kills them for believing his lies. 
<a href="14.html#9">14:9</a>

<p><li> Ezekiel prophesies that Tyrus will be completely destroyed by Nebuchadrezzar and will never be built again. But it wasn't 
destroyed, as evidenced by the visits to Tyre by Jesus and Paul (<A href="../mt/15.html#21">Mt 15:21</A>, 
<A href="../mk/7.html#24">Mk 7:24, 31</A>, <A href="../acts/21.html#3">Acts 21:3</A>).&nbsp;
  <a href="26.html#14">26:14,21</a>, <a href="27.html#36">27:36</a>, <a href="28.html#19">28:19</a>
  
<p><li> Ezekiel prophesies that Israel will reside in its homeland safely and 
    securely, never again to fight neighboring nations. <a href="28.html#24">28:24-26</a>
    
<p><li> Ezekiel makes another false prophecy: that Egypt would be uninhabited by humans or animals for forty years after being destroyed by 
Nebuchadrezzar. But there was never a time when Egypt was uninhabited. Humans and animals have lived there continuously since Ezekiel's prophecy.  
<a href="29.html#10">29:10-11</a>

<p><li> "The day of the LORD is near ... it shall be the time of the heathen."  <a href="30.html#3">30:3</a>

<p><li> The rivers of Egypt (identified as the Nile in NIV, NASB, and RSV) shall dry up. This has 
never occurred.  <a href="30.html#12">30:12</a>

<p><li> Ezekiel prophesies God will protect 
the Israelites from "the heathen". "And they shall be safe in their land." But the Israelites have 
never lived peacefully with their neighbors, and they've never been safe from attack.
  <a href="34.html#28">34:28-29</a> 

<p><li>"And David my servant shall be king over them."<br>
How's that supposed to happen? David had been dead (if he ever lived) for more than 400 years when these words were written. <a href="37.html#24">37:24</a>

<p><li>"Thou shalt come up against my people of Israel ... in the latter days, and I will bring thee against my land, that the heathen may know me ... O Gog."
