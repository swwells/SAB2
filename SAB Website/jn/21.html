<img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (21:3-13) One night Peter and the apostles decided to go fishing. They fished all night but 
caught nothing. The next morning a man on shore asked if they'd caught anything. When they told him they hadn't, the man told 
them to cast their net on the right side of the boat. So they did that and caught so many fish they couldn't haul in the net (153 in all). 

<p>One of the apostles (the one that Jesus loved) decided that the guy on shore was really Jesus. When Peter, who was naked at the time, 
heard it was Jesus, he put his coat on and jumped into the water. Some other apostles came out in another boat and helped tow 
the net to shore. When they got in, Jesus was busy cooking fish over a fire. He told them to 
eat some of the fish and bread he'd been cooking. None of the disciples dared to ask Jesus who he was, but they all figured it was 
Jesus, anyway.
  
<p>(21:3) <i>"Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth ...
 and that night they caught nothing."</i>
    
<p>(21:4) <i>"When the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus."</i>

<p>(21:5) <i>"Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No."</i>

<p>(21:6) <i>"He said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. 
They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes."</i>

<p>(21:7) <i>"That disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard 
that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea."</i><br>
 <a href="../says_about/nudism.html">What the Bible says about nudism</a>
 
<p>(21:8) <i>"The other disciples came in a little ship ... dragging the net with fishes."</i> 

<p>(21:9) <i>"As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread."</i>

<p>(21:10) <i>"Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught."</i>

<p>(21:11) <i>"Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three."</i>

<p>(21:12) <i>"Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, 
Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord."</i>

<p>(21:13) <i>"Jesus ... taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise."</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (21:15-16) Jesus keeps asking Peter the same question: 
Do you love me more than all the others? Peter keeps telling him that he does.

<p>(21:15) <i>"Jesus saith to Simon Peter ... lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; 
thou knowest that I love thee."</i>

<p>(21:16) <i>"He saith to him again the second time, Simon ... lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I 
love thee."</i>

<p><img src="../images/contra1.gif">(21:17) <i>"He saith unto him the third time, Simon ... lovest thou me? Peter 
was grieved because he said unto him the third time, 
Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee."</i><br>

<p>(21:22) <i>"If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?"</i>

<p>(21:23) <i>"Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him,
 He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?"</i><br>
 Either way, Jesus was wrong. John died nearly 2000 years ago and Jesus didn't return. 

<p><img src="../images/contra1.gif" > (21:25) <i>"The world itself could not contain the books that 
should be written."</i><br>
John says that a single book couldn't contain all the things that Jesus did. Yet the author of Acts claims that he included 
everything that Jesus did in his "former treatise" (the gospel of Luke).<br>
