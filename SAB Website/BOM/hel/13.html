<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>13:5</b>   And he said unto them: Behold, I, Samuel, a Lamanite, do speak the words of the Lord which he doth

over this people; and four hundred years pass not away save the sword of justice falleth upon this people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

ye would not receive me. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

declareth unto you the word of the Lord, which testifieth of your sins and iniquities, ye are angry with him, 
and cast him out and seek all manner of ways to destroy him; yea, you will say that he is a false prophet, 
and that he is a sinner, and of the devil, because he testifieth that your deeds are evil. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

do that and ye shall not suffer; yea, he will say: Walk after the pride of your own hearts; yea, walk after 
the pride of your eyes, and do whatsoever your heart desireth -- and if a man shall come among you and say this, 
ye will receive him, and say that he is a prophet. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

words unto you, and he saith that all is well, then ye will not find fault with him. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
