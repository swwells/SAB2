<img src="../../images/fv.gif" > (10:2) <br><i>"Many of our children shall perish in the flesh because of unbelief, nevertheless,
 God will be merciful unto many; and our children shall be restored, that they may come 
to that which will give them the true knowledge of their Redeemer."</i> Jacob woke up the next day and started preaching again. 
He predicted that many Nephite children would "perish in the flesh because of unbelief." But not to worry, God will somehow 
restore the dead little unbelievers by forcing them to believe -- or something like that.

<p><img src="../../images/changes.gif" > (10:3a) <i>"Christ -- for in the last night the angel spake unto me that this should be his name"</i><br>
First appearance of the word "Christ" in the modern BoM. "Christ" appeared earlier (
<a href="../1ne/12.html#18">1 Nephi 12:18</a>) in <a href="http://www.2think.org/hundredsheep/bom1830/inep.shtml">the 
1830 edition</a>, but was changed to "Messiah" to avoid contradicting this verse.

<p><img src="../../images/inj1.gif" >
<img src="../../images/int.gif" > (10:3b) <i>"The Jews ... who are the more wicked part of the world ... they shall crucify him ... there is none other nation on earth that would crucify their God."</i><br>
The angel also told Jacob about Jews. They are, he said, the most wicked people on earth. Only the Jews would crucify their God.

<p><img src="../../images/inj1.gif" >
<img src="../../images/cr1.gif" > (10:6) <i>"Because of their iniquities, destructions, famines, pestilences, and bloodshed shall come upon them; 
and they who shall not be destroyed shall be scattered among all nations."</i><br>
To punish them for their iniquities, God sent famines, disease, wars, and destruction on the Jews.

<p><img src="../../images/pr1.gif" > (10:7) <i>"When ... they ... believe in me, that I am Christ ... they shall be restored ... unto the lands of their inheritance."</i><br>
False prophecy: the Jews returned to Israel without converting to Christianity. 

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (10:8) <a href="aictp_list.html">It shall came to pass</a>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (10:9) <i>"The kings of the Gentiles shall be nursing fathers."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif" > (10:9) And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers.
 -- <a href="../../is/49.html#23">Isaiah 49:23</a>
 
<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" >
<img src="../../images/int.gif"> 
<img src="../../images/inj1.gif" > 
<img src="../../images/lang1.gif" > (10:10-16) God gave America to the Mormon Church, but he likes non-Mormon, non-Catholic, white Christian Americans ("Gentiles" in Mormon-speak) too. God will protect and 
strengthen the United States since it's his favorite country. Whoever fights against the LDS church ("Zion") is "the whore of all the earth" and will perish. And just like Jesus and George Bush, whoever isn't for God 
is against him. 
 
<p>(10:10 <i>"This land, said God, shall be a land of thine inheritance, and the Gentiles shall be blessed upon the land."</i>

Non-Mormon Americans ("Gentiles") are the new Jews and will be both naughty and nice to Mormons, depending on how God feels at the moment.

America was consecrated by God to the seed of Nephi (Mormons). God likes America better than any other 
country. All Americans will someday worship God and become Mormons.

<img src="../../images/sci1.gif" > (10:20-21) Jacob tells the Nephites that they are on an isle of the sea, and since the Bible mentions "isles of the sea" (see for example <a href="../../is/24.html#15">Isaiah 24:15</a>), 
there must be other isles that are inhabited by the descendants of other ancient seafaring Jews. (As I'm sure you've guessed by now, the other inhabitants of the "isles of the sea" are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamanite">
Polynesians</a>.)

<tr><td><a name="1"></a><b>10:1</b>   And now I, Jacob, speak unto you again, my beloved brethren, concerning this righteous branch of which I 
have spoken. 

<tr><td><a name="2"></a><b>10:2</b>   For behold, the promises which we have obtained are promises unto us according to the flesh; wherefore, 
as it has been shown unto me that <span class="i">many of our children shall perish in the flesh 
because of unbelief, nevertheless, God 
will be merciful unto many; and our children shall be restored, that they may come to that which will give them the true 
knowledge of their Redeemer. </span>

<tr><td><a name="3"></a><b>10:3</b>   Wherefore, as I said unto you, it must needs be expedient that <span class="c">Christ -- for in the 
last night the angel spake unto me that this should be his name</span> -- should come among <span class="i">the Jews, among those who are the more 
wicked part of the world; and they shall crucify him</span> -- for thus it behooveth our God, and <span class="i">there 
is none other nation on earth that would crucify their God.</span> 

<tr><td><a name="4"></a><b>10:4</b>   For should the mighty miracles be wrought among other nations they would repent, and know that he be 
their God. 

<tr><td><a name="5"></a><b>10:5</b>   But because of priestcrafts and iniquities, they at Jerusalem will stiffen their necks against him, that 
he be crucified. 

<tr><td><a name="6"></a><b>10:6</b>   Wherefore, <span class="i">because of their iniquities, destructions, famines, pestilences, and bloodshed shall come 
upon them; and they who shall not be destroyed shall be scattered among all nations.</span> 

<tr><td><a name="7"></a><b>10:7</b>   But behold, thus saith the Lord God: <span class="p">When</span> the day cometh that <span class="p">they</span> shall <span class="p">believe in me, that I am Christ</span>, 
then have I covenanted with their fathers that <span class="p">they shall be restored</span> in the flesh, upon the earth, <span class="p">unto the lands of 
their inheritance.</span> 

<tr><td><a name="8"></a><b>10:8</b>   And <span class="a">it shall come to pass</span> that they shall be gathered in from their long dispersion, from the isles of 
the sea, and from the four parts of the earth; and the nations of the Gentiles shall be great in the eyes of me, saith 
God, in carrying them forth to the lands of their inheritance. 

<tr><td><a name="9"></a><b>10:9</b>   Yea, <span class="a">the kings of the Gentiles shall be nursing fathers</span> unto 
them, <span class="plag">and their queens shall become nursing mothers</span>; wherefore, the promises of the Lord are great unto the Gentiles, for he hath spoken it, and who can dispute? 

<tr><td><a name="10"></a><b>10:10</b>   But behold, <span class="a">this land, said God, shall be a land of thine inheritance, and the Gentiles shall be blessed 
upon the land.</span> 

<tr><td><a name="11"></a><b>10:11</b>   And this land shall be a land of liberty unto the Gentiles, and there shall be no kings upon the land, 
who shall raise up unto the Gentiles. 

<tr><td><a name="12"></a><b>10:12</b>   And <span class="a">I will fortify this land against all other nations. </span>

<tr><td><a name="13"></a><b>10:13</b>   And <span class="a">he that fighteth against Zion shall perish, saith God. </span>

<tr><td><a name="14"></a><b>10:14</b>   For he that raiseth up a king against me shall perish, for I, the Lord, the king of heaven, will be 
their king, and I will be a light unto them forever, that hear my words. 

<tr><td><a name="15"></a><b>10:15</b>   Wherefore, for this cause, that my covenants may be fulfilled which I have made unto the children of 
men, that I will do unto them while they are in the flesh, I must needs destroy the secret works of darkness, and of 
murders, and of abominations. 

<tr><td><a name="16"></a><b>10:16</b>   Wherefore, <span class="i">he that fighteth against Zion</span>, <span class="plag">both Jew and 
Gentile, both bond and free, both male and female</span>, <span class="i">shall perish; for 
they are they who are the whore of all the earth; for</span><span class="plag"> they who are not for me are against 
me,</span> saith our God. 

<tr><td><a name="17"></a><b>10:17</b>   For I will fulfil my promises which I have made unto the children of men, that I will do unto them 
while they are in the flesh --  

<tr><td><a name="18"></a><b>10:18</b>   Wherefore, my beloved brethren, thus saith our God: <span class="a">I will afflict thy seed by the hand of the 
Gentiles; nevertheless, I will soften the hearts of the Gentiles, that they shall be like unto a father to them; 
wherefore, the Gentiles shall be blessed and numbered among the house of Israel.</span> 

<tr><td><a name="19"></a><b>10:19</b>   Wherefore, <span class="i">I will consecrate this land unto thy seed, and them 
who shall be numbered among thy seed, forever,</span> for the land of their inheritance; <span class="a">for it is a 
choice land, saith God unto me, above all other lands</span>, <span class="p">wherefore I will have all men that dwell thereon that they 
shall worship me, saith God.</span> 

<tr><td><a name="20"></a><b>10:20</b>   And now, my beloved brethren, seeing that our merciful God has given us so great knowledge concerning 
these things, let us remember him, and lay aside our sins, and not hang down our heads, for we are not cast off; 
nevertheless, we have been driven out of the land of our inheritance; but<span class="a"> we have been led to a better land, for the 
Lord has made the sea our path, and we are upon an isle of the sea. </span> 

<tr><td><a name="21"></a><b>10:21</b>   But <span class="a">great are the promises of the Lord unto them who are upon the isles of the sea; wherefore as it 
says isles, there must needs be more than this, and they are inhabited also by our brethren.
	</span> 

<tr><td><a name="22"></a><b>10:22</b>   For behold, the Lord God has led away from time to time from the house of Israel, according to his will 
and pleasure.  And now behold, the Lord remembereth all them who have been broken off, wherefore he remembereth us 
also. 

<tr><td><a name="23"></a><b>10:23</b>   Therefore, cheer up your hearts, and remember that ye are free to act for yourselves -- to choose the 
way of everlasting death or the way of eternal life. 

<tr><td><a name="24"></a><b>10:24</b>   Wherefore, my beloved brethren, reconcile yourselves to the will of God, and not to the will of the 
devil and the flesh; and remember, after ye are reconciled unto God, that it is only in and through the grace of God 
that ye are saved. 

<tr><td><a name="25"></a><b>10:25</b>   Wherefore, may God raise you from death by the power of the resurrection, and 
also from everlasting death by the power of the atonement, that ye may be received into the eternal kingdom of God, 
that ye may praise him through grace divine.  Amen.
