<font size="-1">    
  <img src="../images/sci1.gif" >(9:1, 7) <i>"Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth."</i><br>
Although this would have been good advice for the mythical Noah, it is wrong for humankind as a whole. Overpopulation is one of 
our greatest problems, yet there is nothing in the bible to address it.<br>
<a href="../says_about/birth_control.html">What the Bible says about birth control</a> 
  
  <p><img src="../images/sci1.gif" >
    <img src="../images/abs1.gif" > (9:2) <i>"The fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon 
    every beast. Into your hand are they delivered."</i><br>
    According to this verse, all animals fear humans. Although it is true that many do, many do not. Sharks and grizzly bears, for example, 
    are generally much less afraid of us than we are of them.<br>
    <img src="../images/sci1.gif" >
    <img src="../images/abs1.gif" > (9:2) <b><i>"Into your hands are they delivered."</i></b><br>
    God gave the animals to humans, and they can do whatever they please with them. This verse has been used by bible believers to 
    justify all kinds of cruelty to animals and environmental destruction.   
    
<p><img src="../images/contra1.gif"  > (9:3) <i>"Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you."</i><br>
<a href="../contra/eat.html">Which animals may we eat?</a>    
    
<p><img src="../images/interp.gif" > (9:4) <i>"But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, 
   shall ye not eat."</i><br> 
God forbids eating meat without first draining the blood. Many Jehovah's Witnesses have needlessly died because the governing body 
considers <a href="../interp/blood.html">blood transfusions</a> to be "eating blood". 

<p><img src="../images/interp.gif"  > (9:6) <i>"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed."</i><br>
Then why did God</a> put a mark on Cain (after he murdered Abel) so that others
wouldn't kill him? (<a href="../gen/4.html#15">Gen.4:15</a>).<br>
<a href="../contra/capital.html">Does God approve of capital punishment?</a><br>
<a href="../says_about/capital.html">What the Bible says about capital punishment</a>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif" >
  <img src="../images/sci1.gif" > (9:9-13) <i>"I do set my bow in the cloud."</i><br>
 God is rightly filled with remorse for having
killed his creatures. He makes a deal with the animals, promising never to drown 
them all again. He even puts the rainbow in the sky so that whenever he sees it, 
it will remind him of his promise so that he won't be tempted to do it again. 
(Every time God sees the rainbow he says to himself: "Oh, yeah.... That's right. 
I promised not to drown the animals again. I guess I'll have to find something 
else to do.").
<p>But rainbows are caused by the nature of light, the
refractive index of water, and the shape of raindrops. There were rainbows
billions of years before humans existed.

    <img src="../images/inj1.gif" >
  <img src="../images/abs1.gif" >
  <img src="../images/contra1.gif" > (9:20-25)<br> The "just and righteous" Noah (<a href="../gen/6.html#9">6:9</a>, 
<a href="../gen/7.html#1">7:1</a>) plants a vineyard, gets drunk, and lies around naked in his tent. His son, Ham, 
happens to see his father in this condition. When Noah sobers up and hears "what his young son
had done unto him" (what did he do besides look at him?), he curses not Ham, who "saw the nakedness of his father," but 
Ham's son, Canaan. "A servant of servants shall he [Canaan] be unto his brethren." This
is a typical case of biblical justice, and is one 
of many Bible passages that have been used to justify slavery.<br> 
<a href="../contra/iniquity.html">Are we punished for the sins of others?</a><br>
 <a href="../says_about/nudism.html">What the Bible says about nudism</a>
 
 <p>(9:20-21) <b><i>"Noah ... drank of the  wine, and was drunken; and he  was uncovered within his tent."</i></b><br>
 <a href="../says_about/alcohol.html">What the Bible says about alcohol</a>
 
 <p>(9:22) <b><i>"Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father."</i></b>
 
 <p><img src="../images/interp.gif" >
 <img src="../images/gay1.gif" > (9:24) <b><i>"Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him."</i></b><br>
 What did Ham do? Did he just look at his naked father or was there something more to it than that? Some commentators have suggested 
  that Ham committed homosexual rape on his drunken father, and that this was why Ham's descendants were eternally punished with slavery.
  <a href="../contra/slavery.html">Does God approve of slavery?</a>
 
 <p>(9:25) <b><i>"And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren."</i></b>
