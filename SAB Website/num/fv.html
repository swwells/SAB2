<p><li>Two of Aaron's sons are killed by God for "offering strange fire before the Lord." <a href="3.html#4">3:4</a>

<p><li>The Law of Jealousies. If a man suspects his wife of being unfaithful, he reports it to the priest. The priest then
makes her drink some "bitter water." If she is guilty, the water makes her thigh rot and her belly swell. If innocent, no harm
done -- the woman is free and will "conceive seed." In any case, "the man shall be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman shall
bear her iniquity."  <a href="5.html#11">5:11-31</a>

<p><li>"And the spirit of  jealousy come upon him ... and she be defiled:
    or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him ... and she be not defiled."</i> <br>
    If a husband is jealous, his wife must submit to the law of jealousies whether she was "defiled" or not. <a href="5.html#14">5:14</a>

<p><li>"Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest ... And the priest shall ... set her before the LORD ... 
and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse."  <a href="5.html#15">5:15-17</a>

<p><li>"And the priest shall ... say unto the woman, If no man have lain with thee ... be thou free from this bitter water 
that causeth the curse." <a href="5.html#19">5:19</a>

<p><li>"Then the priest
    shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say
    unto the woman, The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people,
    when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell." <a href="5.html#20">5:20-21</a>

<p><li>"But if ... some man have lain with thee beside thine husband ... The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, 
when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell." <a href="5.html#22">5:22</a>

<p><li>"And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse." <a href="5.html#24">5:24</a>

<p><li>"And when he hath made her to drink the water ... if she be defiled ... the water that causeth the curse shall ... become bitter, and her belly shall swell, 
and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse among her people." <a href="5.html#27">5:27</a>

<p><li>"And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed." <a href="5.html#28">5:28</a>

<p><li>"Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman shall bear her iniquity." <a href="5.html#31">5:31</a>

<p><li>Because of a dispute between Korah and
Moses, God has the ground open up and swallow Korah, Dathan, and Abiram "and their wives, and 
their sons, and their little children." Then, just for the hell of it, God has a fire burn to death 
250 "men that offered incense."  
<a href="16.html#20">16:20-35</a>

<p><li>Another God-assisted genocide: Bashan and all his people. <a href="21.html#34">21:34-35</a> 

<p><li>When one of the Israelite men brings home a foreign woman, "Phinehas (Aaron's grandson) sees them and throws a spear "through the man .. and the woman through her belly."
This act pleases God so much that "the plague was stayed from the children of Israel." But not before 
24,000 had died.  <a href="25.html#6">25:6-9</a>

<p><li>For impaling the interracial couple, God rewards Phinehas and his sons with the everlasting 
priesthood. <a href="25.html#10">25:10-13</a>

<p><li>Under God's direction, Moses' army defeats the Midianites. They kill all the adult males, but take the women and
children captive. When Moses learns that they left some live, he angrily says: "Have you saved all the women alive? Kill
every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. But all the women children,
that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves." So they went back and did as Moses (and
presumably God) instructed, killing everyone except for the virgins. In this way they got 32,000 virgins -- Wow! 
(Even God gets some of the booty -- including the virgins.) <a href="31.html#1">31:1-54</a>

<p><li>God killed all the Egyptian firstborn. <a href="33.html#4">33:4</a>
