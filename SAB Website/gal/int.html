<p><li>If anyone dares to disagree with Paul on religious matters, &quot;let him be 
accursed.&quot; <a href="1.html#8">1:8-9</a>

<p><li>Those who try to follow the law are cursed.  <a href="3.html#10">3:10</a>

<p><li>"I would they were even cut off which trouble you." Gosh, that doesn't sound very nice. But I wonder what Paul
meant by "cut off". The New Revised Standard Version translates this verse as: "I wish those who unsettle you would
castrate themselves!"  <a href="5.html#12">5:12</a>

<p><li>Witches, idol worshippers, and heretics will not go to heaven. (Guess where they'll be
going.) <a href="5.html#20">5:20-21</a>
