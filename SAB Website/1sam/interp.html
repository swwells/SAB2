<p><li>"He [Eli] fell ... and his neck brake, and he died."<br>
Did God kill Eli and his daughter-in-law to punish him for his sons' sins? <a href="4.html#18">4:18-20</a>

<p><li>Samuel called the Israelites together and selected their king by lot. First the tribe of Benjamin was selected, 
then the family of Matri, and then Saul. <a href="10.html#19">10:19-21</a>

<p><li>"Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a
    book."</i> (Another lost book of the Bible.) <a href="10.html#25">10:25</a>
    
    <p><li>Were David and Jonathan gay? <a href="18.html#1">18:1-4</a>, <a href="19.html#2">19:2</a>, <a href="20.html#41">20:41</a>
    
    <p>"The soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul ... And
Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments ... and his girdle." <a href="18.html#1">18:1-4</a>

<p>"Jonathan ... delighted much in David." <a href="19.html#2">19:2</a>

<p>David and Jonathan "kissed one another, and wept with one another" when they parted for the last time.  <a href="20.html#41">20:41</a>
    
<p><li>"God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand."<br>
    Did God deliver Saul into David's hand? Well, that's what Abishai thought, anyway. And God was involved in the whole thing, since he 
laid a "deep sleep" upon them so that they wouldn't notice them sneak into Saul's tent (26.12).  <a href="26.html#8">26:8</a>
