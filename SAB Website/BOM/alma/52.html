"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",
"<span class='i'>Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever.</span>--<a href='3.html#14'>Alma 3:14</a>",
"<span class='i'>I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</span>--<a href='3.html#15'>Alma 3:15</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",
"<span class='a'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges ... even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year....</span>--<a href='16.html#1'>Alma 16:1</a>",
"<span class='a'>Their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.</span>--<a href='16.html#11'>Alma 16:11</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.   Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</span>--<a href='30.html#22'>Alma 30:22</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",
"<span class='i'>God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.</span>--<a href='30.html#47'>Alma 30:47</a>",
"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",

"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",
"<span class='i'>These dissenters ... became ... more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='47.html#36'>Alma 47:36</a>",
"<span class='a'>God would prosper them in the land, or in other words ... God ... would prosper them in the land.</span>--<a href='48.html#15'>Alma 48:15</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='50.html#22'>Alma 50:22</a>",
"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",
"<span class='i'>The remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty.</span>--<a href='51.html#20'>Alma 51:20</a>",
"<span class='g'>And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye.</span>--<a href='54.html#21'>Alma 54:21</a>",

<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>52:1</b>   <span class="a">And now, it came to pass</span> in the twenty and sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people 
of Nephi, behold, when the Lamanites awoke on the first morning of the first month, behold, they found Amalickiah 
was dead in his own tent; and they also saw that Teancum was ready to give them battle on that day. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1"><a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a>
(52:1, 3, 4, 7, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24, 27, 31, 33, 35, 38)
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>52:2</b>   And now, when the Lamanites saw this they were affrighted; and they abandoned their design in 
marching into the land northward, and retreated with all their army into the city of Mulek, and sought 
protection in their fortifications. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>52:3</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the brother of Amalickiah was appointed king over 
the people; and his name was Ammoron; thus king Ammoron, the brother of king Amalickiah, was appointed to reign in 
his stead. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>52:4</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that he did command that his people should maintain 
those cities, which they had taken by the shedding of blood; for they had not taken any cities save they had lost 
much blood. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>52:5</b>   And now, Teancum saw that the Lamanites were determined to maintain those cities which they had 
taken, and those parts of the land which they had obtained possession of; and also seeing the enormity of their 
number, Teancum thought it was not expedient that he should attempt to attack them in their forts. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>52:6</b>   But he kept his men round about, as if making preparations for war; yea, and truly he was 
preparing to defend himself against them, by casting up walls round about and preparing places of resort. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>52:7</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that he kept thus preparing for war until Moroni had 
sent a large number of men to strengthen his army. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>52:8</b>   And Moroni also sent orders unto him that he should retain all the prisoners who fell into his 
hands; for as the Lamanites had taken many prisoners, that he should retain all the prisoners of the Lamanites 
as a ransom for those whom the Lamanites had taken. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>52:9</b>   And he also sent orders unto him that he should fortify the land Bountiful, and secure the 
narrow pass which led into the land northward, lest the Lamanites should obtain that point and should have 
power to harass them on every side. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>52:10</b>   And Moroni also sent unto him, desiring him that he would be faithful in maintaining that 
quarter of the land, and that he would seek every opportunity to scourge the Lamanites in that quarter, as 
much as was in his power, that perhaps he might take again by stratagem or some other way those cities which 
had been taken out of their hands; and that he also would fortify and strengthen the cities round about, which 
had not fallen into the hands of the Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>52:11</b>   And he also said unto him, I would come unto you, but behold, the Lamanites are upon us in 
the borders of the land by the west sea; and behold, I go against them, therefore I cannot come unto you. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>52:12</b>   Now, the king (Ammoron) had departed out of the land of Zarahemla, and had made known unto the 
queen concerning the death of his brother, and had gathered together a large number of men, and had marched 
forth against the Nephites on the borders by the west sea. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>52:13</b>   And thus he was endeavoring to harass the Nephites, and to draw away a part of their forces 
to that part of the land, while he had commanded those whom he had left to possess the cities which he had taken, 
that they should also harass the Nephites on the borders by the east sea, and should take possession of their 
lands as much as it was in their power, according to the power of their armies. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>52:14</b>   And thus were the Nephites in those dangerous circumstances in the ending of the twenty and 
sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>52:15</b>   <span class="a">But behold, it came to pass</span> in the twenty and seventh year of the reign of the judges, that 
Teancum, by the command of Moroni -- who had established armies to protect the south and the west borders of 
the land, and had begun his march towards the land Bountiful, that he might assist Teancum with his men in 
retaking the cities which they had lost --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>52:16</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Teancum had received orders to make an 
attack upon the city of Mulek, and retake it if it were possible. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>52:17</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Teancum made preparations to make an attack 
upon the city of Mulek, and march forth with his army against the Lamanites; but he saw that it was impossible 
that he could overpower them while they were in their fortifications; therefore he abandoned his designs and 
returned again to the city Bountiful, to wait for the coming of Moroni, that he might receive strength to his 
army. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>52:18</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Moroni did arrive with his army at the 
land of Bountiful, in the latter end of the twenty and seventh year of the reign of the judges over the 
people of Nephi. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>52:19</b>   And in the commencement of the twenty and eighth year, Moroni and Teancum and many of the 
chief captains held a council of war -- what they should do to cause the Lamanites to come out against them 
to battle; or that they might by some means flatter them out of their strongholds, that they might gain 
advantage over them and take again the city of Mulek. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>52:20</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> they sent embassies to the army of the Lamanites, 
which protected the city of Mulek, to their leader, whose name was Jacob, desiring him that he would come out 
with his armies to meet them upon the plains between the two cities.   But behold, Jacob, who was a Zoramite, 
would not come out with his army to meet them upon the plains. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>52:21</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Moroni, having no hopes of meeting them upon 
fair grounds, therefore, he resolved upon a plan that he might decoy the Lamanites out of their strongholds. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>52:22</b>   Therefore he caused that Teancum should take a small number of men and march down near the 
seashore; and Moroni and his army, by night, marched in the wilderness, on the west of the city Mulek; and 
thus, on the morrow, when the guards of the Lamanites had discovered Teancum, they ran and told it unto Jacob, 
their leader. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>52:23</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the armies of the Lamanites did march forth 
against Teancum, supposing by their numbers to overpower Teancum because of the smallness of his numbers.  
And as Teancum saw the armies of the Lamanites coming out against him he began to retreat down by the seashore, 
northward. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>52:24</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when the Lamanites saw that he began to 
flee, they took courage and pursued them with vigor.  And while Teancum was thus leading away the Lamanites 
who were pursuing them in vain, behold, Moroni commanded that a part of his army who were with him should 
march forth into the city, and take possession of it. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>52:25</b>   And thus they did, and slew all those who had been left to protect the city, yea, all 
those who would not yield up their weapons of war. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>52:26</b>   And thus Moroni had obtained possession of the city Mulek with a part of his army, while he 
marched with the remainder to meet the Lamanites when they should return from the pursuit of Teancum. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>52:27</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Lamanites did pursue Teancum until they 
came near the city Bountiful, and then they were met by Lehi and a small 
army, which had been left to protect the city Bountiful. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>52:28</b>   And now behold, when the chief captains of the Lamanites had 
beheld Lehi with his army coming against them, they fled in much confusion, 
lest perhaps they should not obtain the city Mulek before Lehi should overtake 
them; for they were wearied because of their march, and the men of Lehi were 
fresh. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>52:29</b>   Now the Lamanites did not know that Moroni had been in their rear with his army; and all 
they feared was Lehi and his men. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>52:30</b>   Now Lehi was not desirous to overtake them till they should 
meet Moroni and his army. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>52:31</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that before the Lamanites had retreated far they 
were surrounded by the Nephites, by the men of Moroni on one hand, and the men 
of Lehi on the other, all of whom were fresh and full of strength; but the 
Lamanites were wearied because of their long march. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="32"></a>52:32</b>   And Moroni commanded his men that they should fall upon them until they had given up their 
weapons of war. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="33"></a>52:33</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Jacob, being their leader, being also a Zoramite, 
and having an unconquerable spirit, he led the Lamanites forth to battle with <span class="a">exceeding</span> fury against Moroni. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1"><a href="exceed_list.html">Exceedingly</a> (52:33, 35) 
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="34"></a>52:34</b>   Moroni being in their course of march, therefore Jacob was determined to slay them and cut his 
way through to the city of Mulek.  But behold, Moroni and his men were more powerful; therefore they did not give 
way before the Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="35"></a>52:35</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they fought on both hands with 
<span class="a">exceeding</span> fury;
 and there were many slain on both sides; yea, and Moroni was wounded and Jacob was killed. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">


 <tr><td><b><a name="36"></a>52:36</b>   And Lehi pressed upon their rear with such fury with his 
 strong men, that the Lamanites in the rear delivered up their weapons of war; and the remainder of them, 
 being much confused, knew not whither to go or to strike. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="37"></a>52:37</b>   Now Moroni seeing their confusion, he said unto them: If ye will bring forth your weapons of 
 war and deliver them up, behold we will forbear shedding your blood. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="38"></a>52:38</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when the Lamanites had heard these words, 
 their chief captains, all those who were not slain, came forth and threw down their weapons of war at the 
 feet of Moroni, and also commanded their men that they should do the same. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="39"></a>52:39</b>   But behold, there were many that would not; and those who would not deliver up their 
 swords were taken and bound, and their weapons of war were taken from them, and they were compelled to 
 march with their brethren forth into the land Bountiful. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="40"></a>52:40</b>   And now the number of prisoners who were taken exceeded more than the number of those who 
 had been slain, yea, more than those who had been slain on both sides. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
