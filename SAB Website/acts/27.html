  And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered

  And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against

    Salmone;<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part
    advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice,
    and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south
    west and north west.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much

  Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and,

    driven.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

    fasting, having taken nothing.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="34">27:34</A></B>

  <tr><td><B><A name="35">27:35</A></B>
  And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in

  And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  <tr><td><B><A name="39">27:39</A></B>
  And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain

    and made toward shore.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="41">27:41</A></B>
  And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground;
    and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part
    was broken with the violence of the waves.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="42">27:42</A></B>
  And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them
    should swim out, and escape.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and
