<i>Does God live in the Pleiades?</i><br>
Jehovah's Witnesses used to believe that God lives on the planet Alcyone in the Pleiades 
cluster. The only biblical justification for this was this verse and
<a href="../job/38.html#31">Job 38:31</a>. This 
belief was clearly stated in &quot;<a href="http://salmun.cwahi.net/nrm/chrst/jw/books/rut/recon/recon.htm#01">Reconciliation</a>&quot; 
(1928): &quot;But the greatness in size of other stars or planets is small when 
compared with the Pleiades in importance, because the Pleiades is the place of 
the eternal throne of God.&quot; This is just one of many JW beliefs that has since 
died a quiet death and is no longer mentioned in the Watchtower.
