        (6:1-8:10)  <br><b><a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2009/10/gods-48th-killing-lord-set-every-mans.html">Gideon's story: 
        The Lord set every man's sword against his fellow</a></b><br>
        Here's a story about Gideon. You know, the guy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gideon_Bible">they</a> named the Bible after.
       
       <p>It starts out in the usual way. The Israelites do evil in the sight of the Lord (6:1a); God forces the Israelites to be slaves (6:1b); 
       the Israelites cry out to God (6:7); God kills the guys he delivered them to (7:22). (The Midianites this time around. 
       See <a href="2.html#14">Judges 2:14</a>, <a href="3.html#8">3:8</a>, and 
       <a href="8.html#6">8:6</a> for other versions of the same story.)
              
       <p>(6:1) <i>"The children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and 
       the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years."</i>        
     
</font>


<tr><td><B><A name="1">6:1</A></B>
  And <span class="a">the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into
    the hand of Midian seven years.</span>     

  <tr><td><B><A name="2">6:2</A></B>
  And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the
    Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the
    mountains, and caves, and strong holds.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="3">6:3</A></B>
  And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the
    Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="4">6:4</A></B>
  And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth,
    till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep,
    nor ox, nor ass.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="5">6:5</A></B>
  For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and <span class="a">they came as grasshoppers for multitude;
    for both they and their camels were without number</span>: and they
    entered into the land to destroy it.<td bgcolor="eeeeee" rowspan="3"> 
    
    <font size="-1">
       <IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" >       
       <IMG src="../images/contra1.gif" >(6:5) 
       <i>"They came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number."</i><br>
       Every male Midianite was killed during the time of 
       Moses (<a href="../num/31.html#7">Numbers 31:7</a>), and yet 200 years later 
       they flourish like grasshoppers "without number." <br>
       <a href="../contra/midian.html">Did the Israelites kill every male in Midian?</a> 
       
       <p>(6:7) <i>"The children of Israel cried unto the LORD."</i>       
       </font>
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="6">6:6</A></B>
  And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the
    children of Israel cried unto the LORD.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="7">6:7</A></B>
  And it came to pass, when <span class="a">the children of Israel cried unto the LORD</span>
    because of the Midianites,
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="8">6:8</A></B>
  That the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto
    them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and
    brought you forth out of the house of bondage;<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="9">6:9</A></B>
  And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand
    of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from before you, and gave you
    their land;<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="10">6:10</A></B>
  And I said unto you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the
    Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice.<td bgcolor="eeeeee" rowspan="9">
    
    <font size="-1">
    <IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (6:11-12) An angel was sitting under an oak tree when he saw Gideon threshing some wheat. So he started up 
    a conversation with him.
    
    <p>(6:11) <i>"There came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak."</i>
    
  <p>(6:12) <i>"And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him, The LORD
    is with thee, thou mighty man of valour."</i>
    
    <p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (6:14-16) And then God joins in the conversation with Gideon and the angel, promising to help Gideon kill all the Midianites.
    
    <p>(6:14) <i>"The LORD ... said ... thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?"</i>

    <p>(6:15) <i>"And he said ... wherewith shall I save Israel?"</i>

    <p>(6:16) <i>"The LORD said ... I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man."</i>
 
    <p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (6:17) <i>"Shew me a sign."</i><br>
    So Gideon has a three-way conversation with the angel and God, but he doesn't believe either of them. He demands a sign.

  <tr><td><B><A name="11">6:11</A></B>
  And <span class="a">there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak</span> which was in
    Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon threshed
    wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites.

  And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is
    all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our fathers told
    us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD
    hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.

  And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah
    of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and
    brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.<td bgcolor="eeeeee" rowspan="3">
    
    <font size="-1">
    <IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (6:20-21) To prove he's for real, the angel makes fire come out of a rock, burning flesh and cakes.

    cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth."</i>

  Then <span class="a">the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff</span> that was in his

  <tr><td><B><A name="27">6:27</A></B>
  Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said
    unto him: and so it was, because he feared his father's household, and the
    men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="28">6:28</A></B>
  And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, <span class="int">the altar
    of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down</span> that was by it, and <span class="v">the

 <i>"The Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet."</i>
 
 <p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" >
 <IMG src="../images/contra1.gif" > (6:36-40) Then after sacrificing some animals for God, vandalizing his neighbors' places of worship, and blowing a trumpet, Gideon asks for some (more) signs to convince him that God isn't lying to 
       him. (The burning flesh sign in <a href="#20">6:20-21</a> didn't satisfy him.) So he puts down some wool on the ground and asks God to make it wet, while keeping the 
       surrounding ground dry. And God does it, no sweat. But Gideon is still not sure he can trust 
       God, so he asks him to reverse the trick, and make the ground wet and the wool dry. "And God 
       did so ..." Gideon must have been impressed by a God that could do such great things. <br>
       <a href="../contra/test.html">Is it OK to test (or tempt) God?</a>
