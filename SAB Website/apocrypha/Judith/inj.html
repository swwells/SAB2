<p><li> "The Lord our God will require our blood of the afflictions of our enemies, and he will humble all the nations that shall 
rise up against us, and bring them to disgrace." <a href="8.html#20">8:20</a>

<p><li>"O Lord God of my father Simeon, who gavest him a sword to execute vengeance against strangers, who had defiled by their uncleanness, 
and uncovered the virgin unto confusion: And who gavest their wives to be made a prey, and their daughters into captivity ... who were 
zealous with thy zeal: assist ... me."<br>
God not only approved of the Shechem massacre, he gave Simeon the sword to do it with. Judith asks God to help her to go and do likewise. 
<a href="9.html#2">9:2-3</a>

<p><li>Judith prays that God will drown her enemies, like he did the Egyptians. <a href="9.html#6">9:6-9</a>

<p><li>"Give me constancy in my mind, that I may despise him ... For this will be a glorious monument for thy name, when 
	he shall fall by the hand of a woman." <a href="9.html#14">9:14-15</a>

<p><li>Judith lies about her visit, saying she is leaving the Israelites, who will soon 
be destroyed by the Assyrians. She tells the Assyrian watchmen that she plans to meet with Holofernes to show him how to defeat 
the Israelites without losing a single Assyrian soldier. The watchmen are so taken by her beauty that they let her pass. 
<a href="10.html#11">10:11-14</a>

<p><li> Judith continues lying for the Lord, setting an example for believers everywhere. She tells Holofernes that God will 
use Nabuchodonosor to destroy the Israelites for their sins. <a href="11.html#4">11:4-21</a>

<p><li>Judith, with God's approval and assistance, decapitated Holfernes while he slept. <a href="13.html#2">13:2-11</a>

<p><li>Judith shows off the head of Holofernes, assuring everyone that no sex was involved in the 
performance of the murderous deed. <a href="13.html#17">13:17-20</a>

<p><li>"God ... hath cut off the head of all the unbelievers this night by my hand." <a href="13.html#27">13:27-20</a>

<p><li>The Assyrian army ran away after hearing about the headless Holfernes, and the Israelites (with God's help) 
slaughtered them as they ran, taking all their stuff and giving it to Judith -- the forever blessed, glory of Jerusalem and joy of Israel. 
(God gave Judith the strength to behead a sleeping man to reward her for not having sex after her husband died.) 
<a href="15.html#1">15:1-15</a>

<p><li>Judith sings a song of praise to herself for cutting off a sleeping man's head. <a href="16.html#1">16:1-28</a>
