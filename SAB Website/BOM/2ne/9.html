<font size="-1">

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (9:1-2) Jacob threw in a couple more chapters from Isaiah 
(see chapters <a href="7.html">7</a> and <a href="8.html">8</a>) so that 2400 years later the true (LDS) church would know the covenants that God had covenanted with the Jews 
(who will all have become Mormons by then).

<p>(9:1) <i>"And now, my beloved brethren, I have read these things that ye might know concerning the covenants of the 
Lord that he has covenanted with all the house of Israel."</i>

<p>(9:2) <i>"He has spoken unto the Jews ... until the time comes that they shall be restored to the true church."</i> 

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (9:3-54) After the Isaiah break, Jacob returned to his 19th century, frontier American, Protestant sermon, which he delivered to the Nephites circa 550 BCE, 
warning them that they will all burn in hell unless they repent and believe in someone (Jesus H. Christ) who will not exist for another six centuries or so.
