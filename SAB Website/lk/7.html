  And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that
    Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of
    ointment,<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="38">7:38</A></B>
  And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with
    tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet,
    and anointed them with the ointment.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="39">7:39</A></B>
  Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within
    himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and
    what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="40">7:40</A></B>
  And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto
    thee. And he saith, Master, say on.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five
    hundred pence, and the other fifty.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="42">7:42</A></B>
  And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me
    therefore, which of them will love him most?<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="43">7:43</A></B>
  Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And
    he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I
    entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath
    washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="45">7:45</A></B>
  Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not
    ceased to kiss my feet.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="46">7:46</A></B>
  My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my
    feet with ointment.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she
    loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is
    this that forgiveth sins also?<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.
