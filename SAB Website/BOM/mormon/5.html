The LDS church revised <a href="http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/morm/5?lang=eng">the official summary for Mormon 5</a> on 
<a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/lifestyle/50882900-80/mormon-book-church-lamanites.html.csp">December 17, 
2010</a> to read: 
<p><i>"Mormon again leads the Nephite armies in battles of blood and carnage—The Book of Mormon will come forth to convince all Israel 
that Jesus is the Christ—Because of their unbelief, the Lamanites will be scattered, and the Spirit will cease to strive with them—They
 will receive the gospel from the Gentiles in the latter days. About A.D. 375–84."</i>

 other cities which were maintained by Nephites, which strongholds did cut them off that they could not get into the country

 <tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>5:5</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that whatsoever lands we had passed by, and the inhabitants thereof were not gathered in,
  were destroyed by the Lamanites, and their towns, and villages, and cities were burned with fire; and thus three hundred

  <tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>5:6</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that in the three hundred and eightieth year the Lamanites did come again against us

  <tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>5:8</b>   And now behold, I, Mormon, do not desire to harrow up the souls of men in casting before them such an awful

  and that all things which are hid must be revealed upon the house-tops --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  
  <tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>5:9</b>   And also that a knowledge of these things must come unto the remnant of these people, and also unto the 
  Gentiles, who the Lord hath said should scatter this people, and this people should be counted as naught among them -- 
  therefore I write a small abridgment, daring not to give a full account of the things which I have seen, because of the 
  commandment which I have received, and also that ye might not have too great sorrow because of the wickedness of this 
  people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  
  <tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>5:10</b>   And now behold, this I speak unto their seed, and also to the Gentiles who have care for the house of 
  Israel, that realize and know from whence their blessings come. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  arms of Jesus. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  
  <tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>5:12</b>   Now these things are written unto the remnant of the house of Jacob; and they are written after this

  the Lord that they may come forth in his own due time. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  
  <tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>5:13</b>   And this is the commandment which I have received; and behold, they shall come forth according to the

  they may be persuaded that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God; that the Father may bring about, through his 
  most Beloved, his great and eternal purpose, in restoring the Jews, or all the house of Israel, to the land of their 
  inheritance, which the Lord their God hath given them, unto the fulfilling of his covenant; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

    <span class="int">shall become a dark, a filthy, and a loathsome people</span>, beyond

  <i>"This people ... shall become a dark, a filthy, and a loathsome people ... because of their unbelief and idolatry."</i><br>
  The Lamanites (or Native Americans) were once "a delightsome people", but God made them a dark-skinned, "filthy and loathsome 
  people, led about by Satan" because of their unbelief and idolatry.
