<tr><td width="60%"><h3><a name="1"></a><b>Chapter 5</b><td bgcolor="eeeeee" rowspan="22">

<font size="-1">

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif"> (5:1-21) The Book of Abraham finsishes copying (with modification) from the first Genesis creation story and continues with the 
second, re-ordering the verses to avoid <a href="../../contra/accounts.html">the contradction between the two</a>. (Abraham was a very clever guy!)

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(5:1) And thus we will finish the heavens and the earth, and all the hosts of them.
 (<a href="../../gen/2.html#1">Genesis 2:1</a>)
 
 <p><img src="../../images/interp.gif">(5:2-20) <br><i>"And the Gods said among themselves."</i><br>
Although <a href="../../contra/gods.html">the Bible is ambiguous on the subject</a>, the Book of Abraham makes it very clear: there are many 
gods. Mormonism is a polytheistic faith.
 
 <p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(5:2) And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh 
 day from all his work which he had made. (<a href="../../gen/2.html#2">Genesis 2:2</a>)

 <p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(5:3) And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in 
 it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. (<a href="../../gen/2.html#3">Genesis 2:3</a>)
 
 <p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(5:4) These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they 
 were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens, (<a href="../../gen/2.html#4">Genesis 2:4</a>)
 
  <p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(5:5) And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field 
  before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground. 
  (<a href="../../gen/2.html#5">Genesis 2:5</a>)

 <p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(5:6) But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. 
 (<a href="../../gen/2.html#6">Genesis 2:6</a>)

 <p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(5:7) And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils 
 the breath of life; and man became a living soul.(<a href="../../gen/2.html#7">Genesis 2:7</a>)
 
 <p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(5:8) And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he 
 had formed. (<a href="../../gen/2.html#8">Genesis 2:8</a>)

 <p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(5:9) And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, 
 and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. 
 (<a href="../../gen/2.html#9">Genesis 2:9</a>)
 
 <p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(5:10) And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and 
 became into four heads. (<a href="../../gen/2.html#10">Genesis 2:10</a>)

 <p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(5:11) And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. 
 (<a href="../../gen/2.html#15">Genesis 2:15</a>)
 
 <p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(5:12) And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: 
 (<a href="../../gen/2.html#16">Genesis 2:16</a>)
 
  <p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(5:13) But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it:  for in the day that 
  thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. (<a href="../../gen/2.html#17">Genesis 2:17</a>)
  
  <p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(5:14) And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet 
  for him. (<a href="../../gen/2.html#18">Genesis 2:18</a>)

  <p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(5:15) And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, 
  and closed up the flesh instead thereof  (<a href="../../gen/2.html#21">Genesis 2:21</a>)

  <p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(5:16) And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.
   (<a href="../../gen/2.html#22">Genesis 2:22</a>)

  <p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(5:17) And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because 
  she was taken out of Man.(<a href="../../gen/2.html#23">Genesis 2:23</a>)
  
  <p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(5:18) Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall 
  be one flesh. (<a href="../../gen/2.html#24">Genesis 2:24</a>)

  <p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(5:19) And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed. 
  (<a href="../../gen/2.html#25">Genesis 2:25</a>)

  <p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(5:20) (<a href="../../gen/2.html#19">Genesis 2:19</a>) And out of the ground the LORD God formed every 
  beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called 
  every living creature, that was the name thereof.

  <p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(5:21) And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but 
  for Adam there was not found an help meet for him. (<a href="../../gen/2.html#20">Genesis 2:20</a>)<br>
  (Notice that the Book of Abraham contradicts the Genesis story in this verse. In Genesis 2:20, Adam could not find a help meet, but in 5:21 Adam 
  found one.)
  
  <p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif">(5:21) In the Genesis story, God creates Adam, then the animals, and then Eve -- because Adam couldn't find 
  a "help meet" among any of the animals. But in the Book of Abraham story, God creates Adam, Eve, and <i>then</i> the animals. Adam didn't even 
  try to find an animal companion. (It looks like Abraham -- or Joseph Smith -- was a bit embarrassed by the 
  <a href="../../contra/accounts.html">contradictions</a> and absurdities in 
  the original Genesis creation stories.)
