<p><li>"Search the scriptures."<br>
    Good advice. Because those that search the scriptures are sure to reject them. <a href="5.html#39">5:39</a>

<p><li>Jesus tells those who'd like to stone to death an adulteress that whoever among them that is without sin should
"cast the first stone." Good advice -- but it directly contradicts the teachings of the Old Testament 
(<a href="../lev/20.html#20">Lev 20:20</a>). If that
wasn't a good law then why did God make it? Has he since changed his mind? Shouldn't it then be removed (along
with most of the OT) from the bible?  <a href="8.html#7">8:7</a>

<p><li>"The truth shall make you free." <a href="8.html#32">8:32</a>

<p><li>"Love one another."  <a href="13.html#34">13:34</a>

<p><li>"This is my commandment, That ye love one another." If this is what it takes to be a Christian, then count
me in. Unfortunately, Christians often take Jesus' commandment to mean that Christians should love other, like-minded Christians, 
and to hell with everybody else.  <a href="15.html#12">15:12</a>, <a href="15.html#17">17</a>

<p><li>Pilate asked Jesus a very good question: "What is truth?"  <a href="18.html#38">18:38</a>
