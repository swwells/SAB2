<p><li>&quot;After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.&quot; <br>
This may be the verse referred to in <A href="../lk/18.html#32">Luke 18:31-33</A> and <A
href="../1cor/15.html#3">1 Corinthians 15:3-4</A>. However, Hosea 6:2 refers to the people living at the time (hence &quot;us&quot;) who 
were to be torn up by God and therefore cannot be fulfilled by the the death and resurrection of Jesus.
  <a href="6.html#2">6:2</a>
  
<p><li>"The prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is mad." <a href="9.html#7">9:7</a>

<p><li>&quot;When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.&quot;<BR>
Matthew (<A href="../mt/2.html#15">2:15</A>) claims that the flight of Jesus' family to Egypt is a fulfillment of this verse. But Hosea 11:1 is not a prophecy at all. It is a reference to the Hebrew exodus from Egypt and has nothing to do with Jesus. Matthew tries to hide this fact by quoting only the last part of the verse (&quot;Out of Egypt I have called my son&quot;).
