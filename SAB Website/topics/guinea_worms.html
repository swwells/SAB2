<h3>God's Fiery Serpents</a> </h3>

<blockquote>And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the
Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much
discouraged because of the way. And the people spake against God, and against
Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness?
for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this
light bread. And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit
the people; and much people of Israel died. Therefore the people came to Moses,
and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against
thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses
prayed for the people. And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent,
and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is
bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live. And Moses made a serpent of brass,
and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any
man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived. - <a href="../num/21.html#4">Numbers 21:4-9</a></blockquote>


<p >These verses have long fascinated both believers and
skeptics. What were the mysterious &quot;fiery serpents&quot; that God sent to
bite the people, causing many of them to die? Well, parasitologists say it may have been the guinea worm (The nematode
<i><a href="http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/~parasite/dracunculus.html">Dranunculus medinesis</a></i>).


<p >To understand why the guinea worm is suspected, we need
to review its life cycle.


<p >Guinea worm larvae are released by their mothers into a
body of water. The larvae thrash about vigorously until they
attract and are eaten by a copepod, which is a small, nearly microscopic,
crustacean. The copepod is, however, just a temporary home for the worm. It
cannot complete its life cycle unless it can somehow get inside its definitive
host: a human being. This is accomplished when someone drinks water containing
the infected copepods.


<p >The copepod's body is destroyed by the stomach acids,
releasing the guinea worm, which then burrows its way through the intestinal
wall. It begins to migrate through the abdominal cavity and into the connective
tissue, stopping along the way to mate with another migrating worm that it runs
into along the way. By this time females have grown to be nearly a meter in
length, while the males are only a few centimeters. After the worms have sex,
the little male wanders off to find a place to die, while the female continues
her journey through the human body.


<p >While the migration of the female worms causes great pain
and discomfort, it is when the worm reaches its final destination that the
torment really begins. The worms end up just beneath the surface of the skin,
usually in the legs or feet, where they remain for a month or more. Their
metabolic wastes and the host's allergic reaction cause a blister to form,
resulting in intense itching and burning pain. One of the few ways to relieve
the pain is to immerse the blister in water, inducing the worm to break through
the surface of the skin releasing millions of guinea worm larvae. A copepod
eats the larvae, completing the guinea worm life cycle.


<p >But the human suffering is far from over when the worm
breaks through the skin. For although the female worms die soon after releasing
the larvae, their dead meter-long bodies are not easy to remove. And even if the
dead worms can be extracted without rupturing, serious secondary infections
often occur.


<p >So how is the worm removed? Well, the traditional way,
which is still used today, is to carefully wind the worm around a stick. The
only other option is surgical removal, but this is extremely difficult and not
often successful.


<p >Well, now that was interesting. But were the &quot;fiery
serpents&quot; of Numbers 21 guinea worms in disguise? I'll leave that for you
to decide, but some aspects seem to fit the description in Numbers. 


<p >The pregnant females are rather large worms and cause
excruciating pain when breaking through the skin to release their larvae. So it
is easy to see how they could be called &quot;fiery serpents&quot;. 

<p >Guinea worms would have been present in the region at the
time of the Exodus, as they still are today. 

<p >If the Israelites encountered drought conditions, as they
did according to the account in Numbers, it would have facilitated the
transmission of the disease by concentrating worm larvae, intermediate hosts
(copepods), and infected humans at the same water source.

<p >And the serpent on a pole could well represent the most
common form of treatment, then and now: pulling out the guinea worm by winding
it on a stick.


<p >Okay, let's assume the &quot;fiery serpents&quot; were
guinea worms. If so, what message should we take from all this? What is God
trying to tell us here? And what can we learn about God from this passage in
Numbers?


<p >One thing that should be clear to us all, of course, is
the moral of the story: Don’t whine. God can’t stand a whiner. So if you or
your children don’t have enough to eat or drink, well, just keep quiet about
it. Whatever you do don’t mention it to God. If you ever get tempted complain
about it, just look at <a href="../images/guinea.gif">this</a> as a reminder.


<p >So we know why God did it. What isn’t so clear, to me at
least, is how. Did he simply infect the drinking water with guinea worm larvae?
Or did he specially create guinea worms just for the occasion? If so, why
didn’t he clean up afterwards? Why did millions of people have to suffer (and still suffer today)
because the Israelites complained to God about their living conditions?


<p >And what should we make of the “serpent on a pole” thing?
The bible says that people were cured just by looking at it. Maybe it was just
being figurative. (They say the Bible does that a lot.) But the actual
treatment sounds a bit more involved than that.


<p >You also have to wonder why God didn’t explain how to
prevent further infections, because prevention is much easier than treatment.
All that is needed is to filter the drinking water through a fine-mesh cloth to
remove the copepods. (The World Health Organization has nearly eradicated the disease by using this
method.) Wouldn’t that be better than the Moses’ magic brass serpent - or the
real treatment that this may have represented? Didn’t God know how to prevent
the disease that he created?


<p >But the last question is most important of all. Why are
there guinea worms? Did God specifically design these worms to live inside the
body of humans? Or were they created by Satan? Or did they just evolve, and God
had nothing to do with it? If the first is true, then God is evil. If the
second, then there are at least two gods. If the third, then God cannot control
his own creation. Which do you think it is?
