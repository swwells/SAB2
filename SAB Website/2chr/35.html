  Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem: and they
    killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="2">35:2</A></B>
  And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the
    service of the house of the LORD,<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="3">35:3</A></B>
  And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy unto the
    LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of
    Israel did build; it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders: serve now
    the LORD your God, and his people Israel,<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="4">35:4</A></B>
  And prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers, after your courses,
    according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the
    writing of Solomon his son.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="5">35:5</A></B>
  And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of
    the fathers of your brethren the people, and after the division of the
    families of the Levites.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="6">35:6</A></B>
  So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren,
    that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="7">35:7</A></B>
  And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the
    passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty
    thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king's substance.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="8">35:8</A></B>
  And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the
    Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave
    unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred
    small cattle and three hundred oxen.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="9">35:9</A></B>
  Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and
    Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for passover
    offerings five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="10">35:10</A></B>
  So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the
    Levites in their courses, according to the king's commandment.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="11">35:11</A></B>
  And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood from
    their hands, and the Levites flayed them.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="12">35:12</A></B>
  And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to
    the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the LORD, as it
    is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="13">35:13</A></B>
  And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but
    the other holy offerings sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and
    divided them speedily among all the people.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="14">35:14</A></B>
  And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because
    the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering of burnt offerings and
    the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for
    the priests the sons of Aaron.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="15">35:15</A></B>
  And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the
    commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer;
    and the porters waited at every gate; they might not depart from their
    service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="16">35:16</A></B>
  So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the
    passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according
    to the commandment of king Josiah.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="17">35:17</A></B>
  And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that
    time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="18">35:18</A></B>
  And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of
    Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover
    as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel
    that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="19">35:19</A></B>
  In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="20">35:20</A></B>
  After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt
    came up to fight against Charchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out
    against him.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="21">35:21</A></B>
  But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou

    meddling with God, who is with me, that he destroy thee not.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="22">35:22</A></B>
  Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised
    himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of
    Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
