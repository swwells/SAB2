And when the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease, were  saying: Allah and His messenger promised us naught but delusion. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

And when a party of them said: O folk of Yathrib! There is no stand  (possible) for you, therefor turn back. And certain of them (even) sought permission  of the Prophet, saying: Our homes lie open (to the enemy). And they lay not open.  They but wished to flee. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

If the enemy had entered from all sides and they had been exhorted to  treachery, they would have committed it, and would have hesitated thereupon but  little. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

And verily they had already sworn unto Allah that they would not turn their  backs (to the foe). An oath to Allah must be answered for. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Being sparing of their help to you (believers). But when the fear cometh,  then thou (Muhammad) seest 
them regarding thee with rolling eyes like one who  fainteth unto death. Then, when the fear 
departeth, they scald you with sharp tongues  in their greed for wealth (from the spoil). <span class="i">Such have 
not believed. Therefore Allah  maketh their deeds fruitless.</span> <span class="a">And that is easy for Allah.</a> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
