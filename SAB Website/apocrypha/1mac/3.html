When Judas' smaller army saw the Syrians, they were frightened. But Judas told them not to worry. Because success in war depends not on numbers, but on God. 
"The Lord himself will overthrow them."

<p>(3:13) <i>"Seron captain of the army of Syria heard that Judas had assembled a company of the faithful."</i>

<tr><td><B><A name="27">3:27</A></B> Now when king Antiochus heard these words, he was angry in his mind: and he sent and gathered the forces of all his kingdom, an exceeding strong army. 

<tr><td><B><A name="28">3:28</A></B> And he opened his treasury, and gave out pay to the army for a year: and he commanded them, 
that they should be ready for all things. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><B><A name="29">3:29</A></B> And he perceived that the money of his treasures failed, and that the tributes of the country were small because of the dissension,
 and the evil that he had brought upon the land, that he might take away the laws of old times: <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><B><A name="30">3:30</A></B> And he feared that he should not have as formerly enough, for charges and gifts, which he had given before with a

<tr><td><B><A name="31">3:31</A></B> And he was greatly perplexed in mind, and purposed to go into Persia, and to take tributes of the countries, and to gather much money. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><B><A name="32">3:32</A></B> And he left Lysias, a nobleman of the blood royal, to oversee the affairs of the kingdom, from the river Euphrates even to the river of Egypt: <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><B><A name="35">3:35</A></B> And that he should send an army against them, to destroy and root out the strength of Israel,

in the hundred and forty-seventh year: and he passed over the river Euphrates, and went through the higher countries. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><B><A name="38">3:38</A></B> Then Lysias chose Ptolemee the son of Dorymenus, and Nicanor, and Gorgias, mighty men of the king's friends. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><B><A name="41">3:41</A></B> And the merchants of the countries heard the fame of them: and they took silver and gold in 
abundance, and servants: and they came into the camp, to buy the children of Israel for slaves: and there were joined to them 
the forces of Syria, and of the land of the strangers. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
