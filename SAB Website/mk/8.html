the result of two oral traditions of the same story.

<img src="../images/contra1.gif"> (8:22-23) <br>Jesus cures a blind man by spitting in his eyes.

<p>(8:22) <i>"He cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him."</i><br>
<a href="../contra/bethsaida.html">Where did Jesus cure the blind man?</a>

<p>(8:23) <I>"He [Jesus] ... spit on his eyes, and ... asked him if he saw ought."</I><br>
<a href="../contra/spit.html">How did Jesus cure the blind man?</a>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif">
<img src="../images/sci1.gif"> (8:24-25) Jesus' spit did not completely cure the blind man. So Jesus tried again. He put his hands on the man's 
eyes and, this time, the blind man "saw every man clearly." 

<p>(8:24) <I>"He looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking."</i>
 
<p>(8:25) <i>"After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly."</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (8:27-28) There were various opinions about the identity of Jesus. 
Some thought he was Elijah or one of the prophets. And many
thought he was a risen John the Baptist. With credulity like that just about
anyone could later be passed off as the risen Christ.

<p>(8:27) <i>"Whom do men say that I am?"</i>

<p>(8:28) <i>"They answered, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets."</i>

    them, that the Son of man must ... be killed, and after three days rise again."</i><br>
    <A href="../contra/comingdeath.html">Did Jesus forewarn the apostles of his death and resurrection?</a>
    
    <p><img src="../images/lang1.gif" >
<img src="../images/abs1.gif" > (8:32-33) When Peter expressed his dismay about Jesus' 
coming death, Jesus said to him "Get thee behind me, Satan." -- a fine way to address his holiness, the first pope!

<p>(8:32) <i>"Peter ... began to rebuke him."</i>

<p>(8:33) <i>"He rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan."</i>

<p><img src="../images/int.gif">

    adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be

  If you're ashamed of Jesus, he'll be ashamed of you.

  And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and
    saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.

  And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.

  <tr><td><B><A name="31">8:31</A></B>
  And <span class="c">he began to teach
    them, that the Son of man must</span> suffer many things, and be rejected of the
    elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and <span class="c">be killed, and after
    three days rise again.</span>
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="32">8:32</A></B>
  And he spake that saying openly. And <span class="a">Peter</span> took him, and<span class="a"> began to rebuke
    him. </span>
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="33">8:33</A></B>
  But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples,<span class="a"> he rebuked
    Peter, saying, </span> <span class="l">Get thee behind me, Satan</span>: for thou savourest not the things
    that be of God, but the things that be of men.    
   
  <tr><td><B><A name="34">8:34</A></B>
  And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he
    said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take
    up his cross, and follow me.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="35">8:35</A></B>
  For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose
    his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="36">8:36</A></B>
  For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose
    his own soul?
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="37">8:37</A></B>
  Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?

  <tr><td><B><A name="38">8:38</A></B>
  <span class="int">Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words</span> in <span class="l">this
    adulterous and sinful generation</span>; <span class="int">of him also shall the Son of man be
    ashamed</span>, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.
