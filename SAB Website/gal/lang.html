<p><li>If anyone dares to disagree with Paul on religious matters, &quot;let him be 
accursed.&quot; <a href="1.html#8">1:8-9</a>

<p><li>Paul calls the Galatians &quot;foolish&quot; and
thus makes himself worthy of hell fire. (<A
href="../mt/5.html#22">Mt 5:22</A>) <a href="3.html#1">3:1</a>

<p><li>"I would they were even cut off which trouble you." Gosh, that doesn't sound very nice. But I wonder what Paul
meant by "cut off". The New Revised Standard Version translates this verse as: "I wish those who unsettle you would
castrate themselves!"  <a href="5.html#12">5:12</a>
