<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>12:7</b>   For it was by faith that Christ showed himself unto our fathers, after he had risen from the dead; and 
he showed not himself unto them until after they had faith in him; wherefore, it must needs be that some had faith in him, 
for he showed himself not unto the world. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>12:8</b>   But because of the faith of men he has shown himself unto the world, and glorified the name of the Father, 
and prepared a way that thereby others might be partakers of the heavenly gift, that they might hope for those things which 
they have not seen. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>12:9</b>   Wherefore, ye may also have hope, and be partakers of the gift, if ye will but have faith. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>12:10</b>   Behold it was by faith that they of old were called after the holy order of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>12:11</b>   Wherefore, by faith was the law of Moses given.  But in the gift of his Son hath God prepared a more 
excellent way; and it is by faith that it hath been fulfilled. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>12:12</b>   For if there be no faith among the children of men God can do no miracle among them; wherefore, he 
showed not himself until after their faith. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>12:13</b>   Behold, it was the faith of Alma and Amulek that caused the prison to tumble to the earth. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>12:14</b>   Behold, it was the faith of Nephi and Lehi that wrought the change upon the Lamanites, that they 
were baptized with fire and with the Holy Ghost. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>12:15</b>   Behold, it was the faith of Ammon and his brethren which wrought so great a miracle among the 
Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>12:16</b>   Yea, and even all they who wrought miracles wrought them by faith, even those who were before 
Christ and also those who were after. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>12:17</b>   And it was by faith that the three disciples obtained a promise that they should not taste of 
death; and they obtained not the promise until after their faith. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>12:18</b>   And neither at any time hath any wrought miracles until after their faith; wherefore they first 
believed in the Son of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

his faith in God, that <span class="a">when God put forth his finger he could not hide it from the sight of the brother of Jared</span>,

all things, for he could no longer be kept without the veil. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>12:22</b>   And it is by faith that my fathers have obtained the promise that these things should come unto their 
brethren through the Gentiles; therefore the Lord hath commanded me, yea, even Jesus Christ. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>12:23</b>   And I said unto him: Lord, 
	<span class="a">the Gentiles will mock at these things, because of our weakness in writing</span>; 
for Lord thou hast made us mighty in word by faith, but thou hast not made us mighty in writing; for thou hast made all 
this people that they could speak much, because of the Holy Ghost which thou hast given them; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (12:23-25)
<i>"The Gentiles will mock at these things, because of our weakness in writing."</i>

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>12:24</b>   And <span class="a">thou hast made us that we could write but 
little, because of the awkwardness of our hands.</span>  Behold, 
thou hast not made us mighty in writing like unto the brother of Jared, for thou madest him that the things which he 
wrote were mighty even as thou art, unto the overpowering of man to read them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>12:25</b>   Thou hast also made our words powerful and great, even that we 
cannot write them; wherefore, <span class="a">when we write we behold our weakness, and stumble because of the placing 
of our words; and I fear lest the Gentiles shall mock 
at our words. </span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>12:26</b>   And when I had said this, the Lord spake unto me, saying: Fools mock, but they shall mourn; and my 
grace is sufficient for the meek, that they shall take no advantage of your weakness; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>12:27</b>   And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they 
may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves 
before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>12:28</b>   Behold, I will show unto the Gentiles their weakness and I will show unto them that faith, hope and 
charity bringeth unto me -- the fountain of all righteousness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>12:29</b>   And I, Moroni, having heard these words, was comforted, and said: O Lord, thy righteous will be done, 
for I know that thou workest unto the children of men according to their faith; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>12:30</b>   For <span class="a">the brother of Jared said unto the mountain Zerin, Remove -- and it was removed.</span>  And if he had 
not had faith it would not have moved; wherefore thou workest after men have faith. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif">
<i>"The brother of Jared said unto the mountain Zerin, Remove -- and it was removed."</i>

<tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>12:31</b>   For thus didst thou manifest thyself unto thy disciples; for after they had faith, and did speak in 
thy name, thou didst show thyself unto them in great power. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="32"></a>12:32</b>   And I also remember that thou hast said that thou hast prepared a house for man, yea, even among 
the mansions of thy Father, in which man might have a more excellent hope; wherefore man must hope, or he cannot receive 
an inheritance in the place which thou hast prepared. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="33"></a>12:33</b>   And again, I remember that thou hast said that thou hast loved the world, even unto the laying down of 
thy life for the world, that thou mightest take it again to prepare a place for the children of men. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="34"></a>12:34</b>   And now I know that this love which thou hast had for the children of men is charity; wherefore, except 
men shall have charity they cannot inherit that place which thou hast prepared in the mansions of thy Father. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="35"></a>12:35</b>   Wherefore, I know by this thing which thou hast said, that if the Gentiles have not charity, because 
of our weakness, that thou wilt prove them, <span class="plag">and take away their talent</span>, yea, even that which they have received, and 
give unto them who shall have more abundantly. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="36"></a>12:36</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that I prayed unto the Lord that he would give unto the Gentiles grace, that 
they might have charity. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="37"></a>12:37</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Lord said unto me: If they have not charity it mattereth not unto 
thee, thou hast been faithful; wherefore, thy garments shall be made clean.  And because thou hast seen thy weakness 
thou shalt be made strong, even unto the sitting down in the place which I have prepared in the mansions of my Father. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="38"></a>12:38</b>   And now I, Moroni, bid farewell unto the Gentiles, yea, and also unto my brethren whom I love, until we 
shall meet before the judgment-seat of Christ, where all men shall know that my garments are not spotted with your blood. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="39"></a>12:39</b>   And then shall ye know that I have seen Jesus, and that he hath talked with me face to face, and 
that he told me in plain humility, even as a man telleth another in mine own language, concerning these things; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="40"></a>12:40</b>   And only a few have I written, because of my weakness in writing. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="41"></a>12:41</b>   And now, I would commend you to seek this Jesus of whom the prophets and apostles have written, that 
the grace of God the Father, and also the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, which beareth record of them, may be 
and abide in you forever.  Amen. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
