  Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm and

  And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three
    kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and by
    his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of
    Grecia.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
 <tr><td><B><A name="3">11:3</A></B>
  And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and
    do according to his will.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="4">11:4</A></B>
  And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be
    divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor
    according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked
    up, even for others beside those.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="5">11:5</A></B>
  And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he
    shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great
    dominion.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="6">11:6</A></B>
  And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the
    king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an
    agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he
    stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her,
    and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="7">11:7</A></B>
  But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate, which
    shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of
    the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="8">11:8</A></B>
  And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes,
    and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue
    more years than the king of the north.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall return
    into his own land.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="10">11:10</A></B>
  But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great
    forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then
    shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth

    a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="12">11:12</A></B>
  And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up;
    and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthened
    by it.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="13">11:13</A></B>
  For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude

    the vision; but they shall fall.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="15">11:15</A></B>
  So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the
    most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither
    his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to withstand.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole

    the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand on his side,
    neither be for him.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but

    cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

    battle.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="21">11:21</A></B>
  And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not
    give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain
    the kingdom by flatteries.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="22">11:22</A></B>
  And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, and

  He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and
    he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers;

    shall forecast his devices against the strong holds, even for a time.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="25">11:25</A></B>
  And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the
    south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to
    battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they
    shall forecast devices against him.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

    forsake the holy covenant.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
