Lo! I fear my kinsfolk after me, since my wife is barren. Oh, give me from  Thy presence a successor <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Who shall inherit of me and inherit (also) of the house of Jacob. And make  him, my Lord, acceptable (unto Thee). <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="7"><b>19:7</a></b>
(It was said unto him): O Zachariah! Lo! We bring thee tidings of a son  whose name is John; we have given the same name to none before (him). <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="8"><b>19:8</a></b>
He said: My Lord! How can I have a son when my wife is barren and I have  reached infirm old age ? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="9"><b>19:9</a></b>
He said: So (it will be). Thy Lord saith: It is easy for Me, even as I created  thee before, when thou wast naught. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="10"><b>19:10</a></b>
He said: My Lord! Appoint for me some token. He said: Thy token is that  thou, with no bodily defect, shalt not speak unto mankind three nights. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><a NAME="11"><b>19:11</a></b>
Then he came forth unto his people from the sanctuary, and signified to  them: Glorify your Lord at break of day and fall of night. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="12"><b>19:12</a></b>
(And it was said unto his son): O John! Hold fast the Scripture. And we gave  him wisdom when a child, <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

And compassion from Our presence, and purity; and he was devout, <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

And dutiful toward his parents. And he was not arrogant, rebellious. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="15"><b>19:15</a></b>

Peace on him the day he was born, and the day he dieth and the day he shall  be raised alive! <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<span class="c">She said: Lo! I seek refuge in the Beneficent One from thee, if thou art

<span class="c">He said: I am only a messenger</span> of thy Lord, that I may bestow on thee a  faultless son. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

She said: How can I have a son when no mortal hath touched me, neither  have I been unchaste ? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="21"><b>19:21</a></b>
He said: So (it will be). Thy Lord saith: It is easy for Me. And (it will be)  that We may make of him a revelation for mankind and a mercy from Us, and it is a  thing ordained. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="22"><b>19:22</a></b>
And she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a far place. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="23"><b>19:23</a></b> <span class="a">And the pangs of childbirth drove her unto the trunk of the 
palm-tree.</span> She  said: Oh, would that I had died ere this and had become a thing of naught, forgotten! <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" >
<font size="-1">(9:23-25)<br>
Mary complains to a palm tree about the pains of childbirth. The tree tells her to shake its trunk  and ripe dates will fall.</font>

<tr><td><a NAME="24"><b>19:24</a></b> <span class="a">Then (one) cried unto her from below her, saying:</span> Grieve not! Thy Lord hath  placed a rivulet beneath thee, <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

So eat and drink and be consoled. And if thou meetest any mortal, say: Lo! I  have vowed a fast unto the Beneficent, and may not speak this day to any mortal. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="27"><b>19:27</a></b>
Then she brought him to her own folk, carrying him. They said: O <span class="a">Mary</span>!  Thou hast come with an amazing thing. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<span class="a">O sister of Aaron!</span> Thy father was not a wicked man nor was thy mother a  
harlot. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Mary, the mother of Jesus, was the sister of Aaron. (Apparently, 
Muhammad confused Mary with Miriam.)

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (19:30-33) Jesus professes his Islamic faith while still in the cradle, modestly claiming the be a perfect

And warn them of the Day of anguish when the case hath been decided. Now  they are in a state of carelessness, and they believe not. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

O my father! Lo! there hath come unto me of knowledge that which came  not unto thee. So follow me, and I will lead thee on a right path. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

O my father! Lo! I fear lest a punishment from the Beneficent overtake thee  so that thou become a comrade of the devil. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

He said: Rejectest thou my gods, O Abraham ? If thou cease not, I shall  surely stone thee. Depart from me a long while! <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

He said: Peace be unto thee! I shall ask forgiveness of my Lord for thee. Lo!  He was ever gracious unto me. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

We called him from the right slope of the Mount, and brought him nigh in  communion. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
