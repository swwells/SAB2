"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",
"<span class='i'>Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever.</span>--<a href='3.html#14'>Alma 3:14</a>",
"<span class='i'>I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</span>--<a href='3.html#15'>Alma 3:15</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",
"<span class='a'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges ... even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year....</span>--<a href='16.html#1'>Alma 16:1</a>",
"<span class='a'>Their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.</span>--<a href='16.html#11'>Alma 16:11</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",
"<span class='v'>He [Ammon] smote off their arms with his sword; for he did withstand their blows by smiting their arms with the edge of his sword.</span>--<a href='17.html#37'>Alma 17:37</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.   Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</span>--<a href='30.html#22'>Alma 30:22</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",
"<span class='i'>God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.</span>--<a href='30.html#47'>Alma 30:47</a>",
"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Amalekites were of a more wicked and murderous disposition than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='43.html#6'>Alma 43:6</a>",

"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",
"<span class='i'>These dissenters ... became ... more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='47.html#36'>Alma 47:36</a>",
"<span class='a'>God would prosper them in the land, or in other words ... God ... would prosper them in the land.</span>--<a href='48.html#15'>Alma 48:15</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='50.html#22'>Alma 50:22</a>",
"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",
"<span class='i'>The remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty.</span>--<a href='51.html#20'>Alma 51:20</a>",
"<span class='g'>And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye.</span>--<a href='54.html#21'>Alma 54:21</a>",

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>60:2</b>   For behold, I have somewhat to say unto them by the way of condemnation; for behold, ye 
yourselves know that ye have been appointed to gather together men, and arm them with swords, and with 
cimeters, and all manner of weapons of war of every kind, and send forth against the Lamanites, in 
whatsoever parts they should come into our land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>60:3</b>   And now behold, I say unto you that myself, and also my men, and also Helaman and his men, 
have suffered <span class="a">exceedingly</span> great sufferings; yea, even hunger, thirst, and fatigue, 
and all manner of afflictions of every kind. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1"><a href="exceed_list.html">Exceedingly</a> (60:3, 6, 9, 11, 14, 26)
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>60:4</b>   But behold, were this all we had suffered we would not murmur nor complain. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>60:5</b>   But behold, great has been the slaughter among our people; yea, thousands have fallen by the 
sword, while it might have otherwise been if ye had rendered unto our armies sufficient strength and succor 
for them.  Yea, great has been your neglect towards us. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">


<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>60:6</b>   And now behold, we desire to know the cause of this <span class="a">exceedingly</span> 
great neglect; yea, we desire to know the cause of your thoughtless state. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>60:7</b>   Can you think to sit upon your thrones in a state of thoughtless stupor, while your 
enemies are spreading the work of death around you?  Yea, while they are murdering thousands of your 
brethren --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>60:8</b>   Yea, even they who have looked up to you for protection, yea, have placed you in a 
situation that ye might have succored them, yea, ye might have sent armies unto them, to have strengthened 
them, and have saved thousands of them from falling by the sword. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>60:9</b>   But behold, this is not all -- ye have withheld your provisions from them, insomuch 
that many have fought and bled out their lives because of their great desires which they had for the 
welfare of this people; yea, and this they have done when they were about to perish with hunger, because of 
your <span class="a">exceedingly</span> great neglect towards them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>60:10</b>   And now, my beloved brethren -- for ye ought to be beloved; yea, and ye ought to 
have stirred yourselves more diligently for the welfare and the freedom of this people; but behold, 
ye have neglected them insomuch that the blood of thousands shall come upon your heads for 
vengeance; yea, for known unto God were all their cries, and all their sufferings --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>60:11</b>   Behold, could ye suppose that ye could sit upon your thrones, and because of the 
<span class="a">exceeding</span> goodness of God ye could do nothing and he would deliver you?  Behold, if ye have 
supposed this ye have supposed in vain. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>60:12</b>   Do ye suppose that, because so many of your brethren have been killed it is because of 
their wickedness?  I say unto you, if ye have supposed this ye have supposed in vain; for I say unto you, 
there are many who have fallen by the sword; and behold it is to your condemnation; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>60:13</b>   For <span class="i">the Lord suffereth the righteous to be slain that his justice and judgment may come 
upon the wicked</span>; therefore ye need not suppose that the righteous are lost because they are slain; but 
behold, they do enter into the rest of the Lord their God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/inj1.gif" width="32" height="32"><br>
<font size="-1">God allows the righteous to be killed so that he can judge the wicked.

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>60:14</b>   And now behold, I say unto you, I fear <span class="a">exceedingly</span> that the 
judgments of God will come upon this people, because of their <span class="a">exceeding</span> slothfulness, yea, even the 
slothfulness of our government, and their <span class="a">exceedingly</span> great neglect towards their brethren, 
yea, towards those who have been slain. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>60:15</b>   For were it not for the wickedness which first commenced at our head, we could have 
withstood our enemies that they could have gained no power over us. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>60:16</b>   Yea, had it not been for the war which broke out among ourselves; yea, were it not 
for these king-men, who caused so much bloodshed among ourselves; yea, at the time we were contending 
among ourselves, if we had united our strength as we hitherto have done; yea, had it not been for the 
desire of power and authority which those king-men had over us; had they been true to the cause of 
our freedom, and united with us, and gone forth against our enemies, instead of taking up their swords 
against us, which was the cause of so much bloodshed among ourselves; yea, if we had gone forth against 
them in the strength of the Lord, we should have dispersed our enemies, for it would have been done, 
according to the fulfilling of his word. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>60:17</b>   But behold, now the Lamanites are coming upon us, taking possession of our lands, and they 
are murdering our people with the sword, yea, our women and our children, and also carrying them away captive, 
causing them that they should suffer all manner of afflictions, and this because of the great wickedness of 
those who are seeking for power and authority, yea, even those king-men. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>60:18</b>   But why should I say much concerning this matter?  For we know not but what ye yourselves are 
seeking for authority.  We know not but what ye are also traitors to your country. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>60:19</b>   Or is it that ye have neglected us because ye are in the heart of our country and ye are surrounded 
by security, that ye do not cause food to be sent unto us, and also men to strengthen our armies? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>60:20</b>   Have ye forgotten the commandments of the Lord your God?   Yea, have ye forgotten the 
captivity of our fathers?  Have ye forgotten the many times we have been delivered out of the hands of 
our enemies? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>60:21</b>   Or do ye suppose that the Lord will still deliver us, while we sit upon our thrones and 
do not make use of the means which the Lord has provided for us? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>60:22</b>   Yea, will ye sit in idleness while ye are surrounded with thousands of those, yea, and 
tens of thousands, who do also sit in idleness, while there are thousands round about in the borders of the 
land who are falling by the sword, yea, wounded and bleeding? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>60:23</b>   Do ye suppose that God will look upon you as guiltless while ye sit still and behold 
these things?  Behold I say unto you, Nay.  Now I would that ye should remember that God has said that 
the inward vessel shall be cleansed first, and then shall the outer vessel be cleansed also. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>60:24</b>   And now, except ye do repent of that which ye have done, and begin to be up and doing, and 
send forth food and men unto us, and also unto Helaman, that he may support those parts of our country which 
he has regained, and that we may also recover the remainder of our possessions in these parts, behold it will 
be expedient that we contend no more with the Lamanites until we have first cleansed our inward vessel, yea, 
even the great head of our government. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>60:25</b>   And except ye grant mine epistle, and come out and show unto me a true spirit of 
freedom, and strive to strengthen and fortify our armies, and grant unto them food for their support, 
behold I will leave a part of my freemen to maintain this part of our land, and I will leave the strength 
and the blessings of God upon them, that none other power can operate against them --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>60:26</b>   And this because of their <span class="a">exceeding</span> faith, and their patience in their tribulations --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>60:27</b>   And I will come unto you, and if there be any among you that has a desire for freedom, 
yea, if there be even a spark of freedom remaining, behold I will stir up insurrections among you, even 
until those who have desires to usurp power and authority shall become extinct. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>60:28</b>   Yea, behold I do not fear your power nor your authority, but it is my God whom I fear; and it 
is according to his commandments that I do take my sword to defend the cause of my country, and it is because of 
your iniquity that we have suffered so much loss. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>60:29</b>   Behold it is time, yea, the time is now at hand, that except ye do bestir yourselves in 
the defence of your country and your little ones, the sword of justice doth hang over you; yea, and it 
shall fall upon you and visit you even to your utter destruction. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>60:30</b>   Behold, I wait for assistance from you; and, except ye do administer unto our relief, behold, 
I come unto you, even in the land of Zarahemla, and smite you with the sword, insomuch that ye can have no more 
power to impede the progress of this people in the cause of our freedom. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>60:31</b>   For behold, the Lord will not suffer that ye shall live and wax strong in your iniquities 
to destroy his righteous people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="32"></a>60:32</b>   Behold, can you suppose that the Lord will spare you and come out in judgment against 
the Lamanites, when it is the tradition of their fathers that has caused their hatred, yea, and it has 
been redoubled by those who have dissented from us, while your iniquity is for the cause of your love of 
glory and the vain things of the world? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="33"></a>60:33</b>   Ye know that ye do transgress the laws of God, and ye do know that ye do trample them 
under your feet.  Behold, the Lord saith unto me: If those whom ye have appointed your governors do not 
repent of their sins and iniquities, ye shall go up to battle against them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="34"></a>60:34</b>   And now behold, I, Moroni, am constrained, according to the covenant which I have made to keep 
the commandments of my God; therefore I would that ye should adhere to the word of God, and send speedily unto 
me of your provisions and of your men, and also to Helaman. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="35"></a>60:35</b>   And behold, if ye will not do this I come unto you speedily; for behold, God will not 
suffer that we should perish with hunger; therefore he will give unto us of your food, even if it must 
be by the sword.  Now see that ye fulfil the word of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="36"></a>60:36</b>   Behold, I am Moroni, your chief captain.  I seek not for power, but to pull it down.  
I seek not for honor of the world, but for the glory of my God, and the freedom and welfare of my country.  
And thus I close mine epistle. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
