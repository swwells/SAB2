<i>"So the LORD saved Israel that day."</i><br> 
God saved Israel by forcing Philistines to kill each other.

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif">(14:24-43)
     Saul tells his soldiers not to eat anything until he kills all of his enemies, saying that anyone who eats anything is cursed. But his son Jonathan 
    didn't hear about his father's curse and he ate a bit of honey. So Saul says his son is cursed and must die.
    
    <p>(14:24) <i>"Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged 
    on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food."</i>
    
<p>(14:25) <i>"They ... came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground."</i>

<p>(14:27) <i>"Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod 
that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened."</i><br>
Jonathan’s eyes were enlightened when he ate the forbidden honey. (It was very special honey.)   

<p>(14:28) <i>"Then one of the people ... said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, 
saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day."</i>
