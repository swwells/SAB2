<img src="../../images/int.gif" > (28:1-15) In <a href="27.html">the last chapter</a>, Nephi revealed the Book of Mormon, 2400 years before Joseph Smith dug it up in his own backyard. Amazing stuff.

<p>Now he tells us how it will be received by Christians everywhere.

<p>But first he reminds us about how God views non-Mormon Christians. 

<p>(29:1) <i>"Behold, my brethren, I have spoken unto you, according as the Spirit hath constrained me."</i>

<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>28:1</b>   And now, <span class="a">behold, my brethren, I have spoken unto you, according as the Spirit hath 
constrained me</span>; wherefore, I know that they must surely come to pass. 

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>28:2</b>   And the things which shall be written out of the book shall be of great worth unto 
the children of men, and especially unto our seed, which is a remnant of the house of Israel. 

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>28:3</b>   For <span class="a">it shall come to pass</span> in that day that the churches which are built up, and not 
unto the Lord, when the one shall say unto the other: Behold, I, I am the Lord's; and the others shall say: I, I am the 
Lord's; and thus shall every one say that hath built up churches, and not unto the Lord --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

die; and if it so be that we are guilty, God will beat us with a few stripes, and at last we shall be saved in the
