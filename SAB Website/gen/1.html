  (1:1-2:3) <b><i>"In the beginning"</i></b><br>
  The first of two contradictory creation accounts. Compare
with <A href="2.html#4">Genesis 2:4-25</A> in which the order of events is entirely different.<br>
<A href="../contra/accounts.html">The two creations</a><br>
<a href="../contra/who_created.html">Who created heaven and earth?</a><br>
  <a href="../interp/universe.html">When was the universe created?</a><br>
  <a href="../interp/gap.html">The Gap Theory</a>

<p>(1:1-2:3) The Genesis 1 account conflicts with the order of
events that are known to science. 

<p>In Genesis 1:1, the earth and "heaven" are created together "in the beginning," whereas according to 
current estimates, the earth and universe are about 4.6  and 13.7 billion years old, respectively.

<p>In Genesis, the earth is created (1:1) before light (1:3), sun and stars (1:16); birds and whales (1:21) before reptiles and 
insects (1:24); and flowering plants (1:11) before any animals (1:20). The order of events known from science is in each case just the opposite.
  
 <p>(1:3-5, 14-19) <i>"Let there be light"</i><br>God creates light and separates light from darkness, and day from 
night, on the first day. Yet he didn't make the light producing objects (the sun and the stars) until the fourth 
day (<A href="#14">1:14-19</A>). And how could there be &quot;the evening and the morning&quot; on the first 
day if there was no sun to mark them?

<p>(1:6-8) <i><a href="../topics/firmament.html">The Firmament</a></i> (Heaven) <br>God spends one-sixth of his entire creative 
effort (the second day) working on a solid firmament. This strange structure, 
which God calls heaven, is intended to separate the higher waters from the lower 
waters.

<p>(1:11-13) <i>"Let the earth bring forth grass"</i><br>Plants are made on the third day before there was a sun
to drive their photosynthetic processes (<A href="#14">1:14-19</A>). 
Notice, though, that God lets &quot;the earth bring forth&quot; the plants, rather than 
creating them directly. Maybe Genesis is not so anti-evolution after all.<br>
<A href="../contra/plants.html">Were plants created before or after humans?</a> <br>
<a href="../interp/evolution.html">Does the Bible teach evolution?</a> 

<p>(1:14) <i>"Let them be for signs"</i><br>
God placed the sun, moon, and stars in the firmament so that they can be used "for signs". This, of course, is exactly what astrologers do: read "the signs" in the 
Zodiac to predict what will happen on Earth.<br>
 <a href="../contra/astrology.html">Does the bible condemn astrology?</a><br>
 <a href="../says_about/astrology.html">What the Bible says about astrology</a>
 
 <p>(1:16a) <i>"God made the two great lights."</i><br>
"The greater light [the sun] to rule the day, and the lesser light [the moon] to rule the night." But the moon is not a light; it only reflects 
light from the sun. And why, if God made the moon to "rule the night", does it spend half of its time moving through the daytime sky?
  
  <p>(1:16b) <i>"He made the stars also."</i><br>
God spends a day making light (before making the sun and stars) and separating light from darkness; then, at the end of a hard day's work, 
and almost as an afterthought, he makes <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/01/number-of-stars-in-universe_n_790563.html">300 sextillion stars</a>. <br>
<a href="../contra/stars_made.html" >When were the stars made?</a>

 <p>(1:17) <i>"God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light 
upon the earth."</i><br>Then why is only a tiny fraction of stars visible from earth? Under the 
best conditions, no more than a few thousand stars are visible with the unaided eye, yet there 
are hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy and a hundred billion or so galaxies. Were they 
all created "to give light upon the earth"?

<p>(1:20) <i>"Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl."</i><br>
     <a href="../contra/animals.html">From what were the animals created?</a><br>
  <a href="../contra/fowl.html">From what were the fowls created?</a>
  
  <p>(1:24) <i>"Let the earth bring forth the living creature."</i><br>
<a href="../interp/evolution.html" >Does the Bible teach evolution?</a>

  <p>(1:25)  <i>"God made the beast of the earth."</i>  <br> 
<A href="../contra/humans.html" >Were humans created before the other animals?</a><br>
<a href="../interp/beasts.html">"The beast of the earth"</a>

<p>(1:26a) <i>"Let us make man in our image."</i><br>
<A href="../contra/gods.html" >How many gods are there?</a><br>

<p>(1:26b) <i>"Let them have dominion ... over all the earth."</a></i> <br>
God gave humans dominion over every other living thing on earth. This couldn't be true, of course, 
since millions of other species existed for millions of years before humans existed. But this verse is used by fundamentalist Christians to justify their mistreatment of other species and disregard for the environment. After all, they believe that God created the other species just for them, so they can do whatever they please with them.

<p>(1:27) <i>"Male and female created he them."</i><br>
<a href="../interp/adam.html" >When was Adam created?</a><br>
<a href="../contra/eve.html">When was Eve created?</a><br>
<a href="../interp/male_and_female.html">Is God both male and female?</a><br>
<a href="../interp/preadamites.html">The Pre-Adamites</a>

<p><img src="../images/pol.gif"> (1:28) <i>"Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have
     dominion over ... every living thing that moveth upon the earth."</i> <br>
     God commands us to "be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over ... 
     every living thing that moveth upon the earth." 
     This verse is used to justify Christian opposition to birth control, concern for the environment, and animal rights. 
     The earth was made for humans, and they can do as they damn well please with it.<br>
<a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ann_Coulter#On_the_environment">Ann Coulter</a> says, presumably using this verse as for justification,
"God gave us the earth. We have dominion over the plants, the animals, the trees. God said, 'Earth is yours. Take it. Rape it. It's yours.'"<br>
  <a href="../says_about/birth_control.html">What the Bible says about birth control</a><br>
  <a href="../contra/childbearing.html">Is childbearing sinful?</a>
  
  <p>(1:29)  <i>"I have given you every herb ... and every tree ... for meat."</i><br>
  Since many plants have evolved poisons to protect against animals that would like to eat them, God's advice is more than a little reckless. 
  Would you tell your children to go out in the garden and eat whatever plants they encounter? Of course not. But then, you are much nicer and smarter than God.
  <a href="../contra/tree.html" >May Adam eat from any tree?</a> <br>
  <a href="../contra/eat.html">What should we eat?</a><br>
  <a href="../interp/420.html">Is it okay to smoke marijuana?</a> 
  
  <p>(1:30)  <i>"To every beast ... I have given every green herb for  meat."</i><br>
  All animals were originally herbivores. Tapeworms, vampire bats, mosquitoes, and barracudas -- all were strict vegetarians, as created by God.

<p>(1:31) <i><a href="1_31.html"><i>God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good."</i></a><br>
God purposefully designed a system that ensures the suffering and death of all his creatures, parasite and host, predator and prey.
