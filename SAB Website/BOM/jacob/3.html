<td bgcolor="eeeeee">


<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>3:1</b>   But behold, I, Jacob, would speak unto you that are pure in heart.  Look unto God with firmness of mind, 
and pray unto him with exceeding faith, and he will console you in your afflictions, and he will plead your cause, and 
send down justice upon those who seek your destruction. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>3:2</b>   O all ye that are pure in heart, lift up your heads and receive the pleasing word of God, and feast upon 
his love; for ye may, if your minds are firm, forever. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>3:3</b>   But, wo, wo, unto you that are not pure in heart, that are filthy this day before God; for except ye 
repent <span class="i">the land is cursed for your sakes; and the Lamanites, which are not filthy like unto you, nevertheless they are 
cursed with a sore cursing</span>, shall scourge you even unto destruction. <td bgcolor="eeeeee" rowspan="12">

<img src="../../images/int.gif" > (3:3) <i>"The land is cursed for your sakes; and the Lamanites, which are not filthy like unto you, nevertheless they are 
cursed with a sore cursing."</i><br>
God curses "the land" to punish humans, and he has cursed the Lamanites (Native Americans) "with a sore cursing."

<p><img src="../../images/inj1.gif" >
<img src="../../images/int.gif" > (3:5) <i>"The Lamanites ... whom ye hate because of their filthiness and the cursing which hath 
come upon their skins, are more righteous than you; for they have not forgotten the commandment of the Lord, which was given unto 
our father -- that they should have save it were one wife, and concubines they should have none, and there should not be 
whoredoms committed among them."</i><br>
The Lamanites are filthy and have dark skins because they were cursed by God. (But 
at least they weren't polygamists, as were the Nephites.)

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" >
<img src="../../images/inj1.gif" >
<img src="../../images/int.gif" > (3:8) <i>"Unless ye shall repent of your sins that their skins will be whiter than yours."</i><br>
If you don't repent, God will make your skin even darker than that of the Lamanites.

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" >
<img src="../../images/inj1.gif" >
<img src="../../images/int.gif" > (3:9) <i>"The darkness of their skins ... [and] their filthiness ... came because of their fathers."</i><br>
God made the Lamanites filthy and dark skinned "because of their fathers."

<p><img src="../../images/cr1.gif" >
<img src="../../images/inj1.gif" >
<img src="../../images/int.gif" > (3:11) <i>"Loose yourselves from the pains of hell that ye may not become angels to the devil, to be cast into that 
lake of fire and brimstone."</i> 

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif" > (3:11) The lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.

 <p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (3:12-13)  <i>"I, Jacob, spake many more things ... And a hundredth part 
 of the proceedings of this people, which now began to be numerous, 
 cannot be written upon these plates; but many of their proceedings are written upon the larger plates."</i><br>
Jacob continued his sermon to the Nephites, but he only has space for less than 1% of it (which began to be numerous) in the small plates. 
See the large plates for the details.

 <p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (3:14) <i>"These plates are called the plates of Jacob, and they were made by the hand of Nephi.  And I make an 
end of speaking these words."</i><br>
Jacob's small plates are called the plates of Jacob, and they were made by the (dead?) hand of Nephi. 
And that's all Jacob has to say about that.

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>3:4</b>   And the time speedily cometh, that except ye repent they shall possess the land of your inheritance, and 
the Lord God will lead away the righteous out from among you. 

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>3:5</b>   Behold, <span class="i">the Lamanites your brethren, whom ye hate because of their filthiness and the cursing which hath 
come upon their skins, are more righteous than you; for they have not forgotten the commandment of the Lord, which was 
given unto our father -- that they should have save it were one wife, and concubines they should have none, and there 
should not be whoredoms committed among them.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>3:6</b>   And now, this commandment they observe to keep; wherefore, because of this observance, in keeping this 
commandment, the Lord God will not destroy them, but will be merciful unto them; and one day they shall become a blessed 
people. 

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>3:7</b>   Behold, their husbands love their wives, and their wives love their husbands; and their husbands and 
their wives love their children; and their unbelief and their hatred towards you is because of the iniquity of their 
fathers; wherefore, how much better are you than they, in the sight of your great Creator? 

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>3:8</b>   O my brethren, I fear that <span class="i">unless ye shall repent of your sins that 
their skins will be whiter than yours</span>, when ye shall be brought with them before the throne of God. 

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>3:9</b>   Wherefore, a commandment I give unto you, which is the word of God, that ye revile no 
more against them because of <span class="i">the darkness of their skins</span>; neither shall ye revile against them 
because of <span class="i">their filthiness</span>; but ye shall remember your own filthiness, and remember that 
<span class="i">their filthiness came because of their fathers.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>3:10</b>   Wherefore, ye shall remember your children, how that ye have grieved their hearts because of the example 
that ye have set before them; and also, remember that ye may, because of your filthiness, bring your children unto 
destruction, and their sins be heaped upon your heads at the last day. 

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>3:11</b>   O my brethren, hearken unto my words; arouse the faculties of your souls; shake yourselves that ye may 
awake from the slumber of death; and loose yourselves from <span class="v">the pains of hell</span> that ye may not become angels to the devil, 
to be <span class="v">cast into that lake of fire and brimstone</span> <span class="plag">which is the second death</span>. 

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>3:12</b>   And now<span class="a"> I, Jacob, spake many more things unto the people of Nephi</span>, warning them against fornication and 
lasciviousness, and every kind of sin, telling them the awful consequences of them. 

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>3:13</b> <span class="a">And a hundredth part of the proceedings of this people, which now began to be numerous, cannot be 
written upon these plates; but many of their proceedings are written upon the larger plates</span>, and their wars, and their 
contentions, and the reigns of their kings. 

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>3:14</b>   <span class="a">These plates are called the plates of Jacob, and they were made by the hand of Nephi.  
And I make an end of speaking these words. </span>
