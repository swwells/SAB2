<p><li>"Joseph and his mother"<br>
    Many manuscripts say "his father and his mother," but scribes later changed this to "Joseph and his mother" to avoid calling 
    Joseph Jesus' father. <a href="2.html#33">2:33</A>
    
<p><li><a href="../contra/rain.html">How long was Elijah's drought?</a> <a href="4.html#25">4:25</a>
      
<p><li>Peter (he was called Simon back then), whom Catholics consider the first pope, was married. [Though he later abandoned his wife and 
family to follow Jesus(<a href="5.html#11">5:11</a>) who gave him a big reward for doing so (<a href="18.html#29">18:29-30</a>).]

<p><li>The earliest manuscripts show a much different version of the "Lord's Prayer." Since the prayer found in Matthew 
    (<a href="../mt/6.html#9">6:9-13</a>) had become so important liturgically, scribes simply changed the Luke's version 
    to match. <a href="11.html#2">11:2-5</a>
    
<p><li>Jesus insults his mother (the Most Holy Blessed Virgin Mary). <a href="11.html#27">11:27-28</a>

<p><li>"The kingdom of God is within you." That has a nice sound to it, but I don't know what it means. <a href="17.html#21">17:21</a>

<p><li>"Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God."<br>
Apparently Jesus thought he was neither good nor God. <a href="18.html#19">18:19</a>

   <p><li>"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's."<br>
     Pay your taxes. Keep state and church separate. <a href="20.html#25">20:25</a>

<p><li>These verses are found in some (but not all) of the oldest and best manuscripts. Were they added to (or deleted from) the 
    Biblical text by a scribe? <a href="22.html#43">22:43-44</a>

<p><li>The phrase "truly I say unto you" is used by Jesus more than 50 times in the NT. In all verses 
except this one, the Watchtower places the comma after the word "you". But the NWT translates this verse as follows: "Truly I tell you today, 
You will be with me in paradise." 

<p>Why would they do that? Well, the Governing Body doesn't believe in a soul, so they say the good thief died
like everyone else. Only later, nearly 2000 years later, after Armageddon, would he be resurrected. So they 
couldn't let Jesus tell him that he'd be with him that very day in paradise. Instead, they have Jesus say 
that he is telling the truth today (Not yesterday or tomorrow, but today. Or 
maybe "today" here is emphasizing that he's telling the truth today, but he was lying yesterday or 
something) -- and that sometime in the far distant future they'd be together in paradise. <a href="23.html#43">23:43</a>

<p><li>"And carried up into heaven"<br>
  This phrase appears to be a later addition, since it is not present in some early manuscripts. <a href="24.html#51">24:51</a>
