According to this verse David's army had 
1,100,000 men from Israel and 470,000 men from Judah, but <A href="../2sam/24.html#9">2 Sam.24:9</A> 
says the numbers were 800,000 and 500,000, respectively. Of course, either of these numbers is 
ridiculously high for a battle between two tribal armies in 1000 BCE. (The United States had about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces#Personnel">1.43 
million</a> active duty soldiers in 2010.)

<img src="../images/cr1.gif" > (21:7-17) God gets angry with 
David for counting the people and for a punishment he offers him three choices: Three years of famine, three months to be 
destroyed by enemies, or three
days of pestilence. When David can't make up his mind, God decides for him and
sends a pestilence that kills 70,000 men. (Presumably women and children were
also killed. If so, the total must have been more than 200,000.) In the middle
of the slaughter, God "repents of the
evil" that he was doing and tells the angel to stop the killing. One
wonders what God had in mind in the first place, since it was David who was
supposed to have sinned by taking the census -- not the people. Even David was
confused by this, and asked God, "these sheep, what have they done?"<br>
