  Now it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had heard how

<img src="../images/abs1.gif" > (10:8-14) <i>The Amorite massacre</i><br>
   Joshua and the Israelites slaughtered or enslaved the people from every city that they came across. They 
   <a href="6.html#21" titile="Joshua 6:21">killed everyone in Jericho</a> and <a href="8.html" titile="Joshua 8">Ai</a>, and 
   <a href="9.html#21" title="Joshua 9:21-25">enslaved the people of Gibeon</a>. So 
   the neighboring cities were getting kind of nervous.
   
   <p>The five kings from these cities (the Amorite coalition) decided to attack the Israelites. Then God gets involved.
   
   <p>God tells Joshua not to worry; he has given the Amorites into his hand, and the Amorites would run away when attacked.
   
   <p>So Joshua attacked, but God did most of the dirty work. He "discomfited" them and even "chased them along the way," throwing down 
   giant hailstones from heaven that killed even more Amorites than the Israelite army. 
   
   <p>Then, in one of his most impressive feats in the entire Bible, God made the sun and the moon stop moving for 24 hours so that Joshua could get all his killing done in braod daylight. 
   "The Lord God fought for Israel."
