<H3>Jeremiah: Cruelty and Violence</H3>
<ol>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="cr.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->
<p><li> God tries to "correct"&nbsp; people by killing their children.  <a href="2.html#30">2:30</a>

<p><li>"Circumcise the foreskin of your heart" or God will burn you to death. <a href="4.html#4">4:4</a>

<p><li>"I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction." <a href="4.html#6">4:6</a>

<p><li>"The lion is come up from his thicket ... and thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant." <a href="4.html#7">4:7</a>

<p><li>Lament and howl: for the fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from us." <a href="4.html#8">4:8</a>

<p><li> What was once fruitful is now barren.  Birds have fled, people are gone, towns are in ruins.  All "by his (God's) fierce anger." 
<a href="4.html#25">4:25-26</a>

<p><li>God tries to reform people by tormenting them and then wonders why it doesn't work. <a href="5.html#3">5:3</a>

<p><li>God will send lions, wolves, and leopards to tear people to pieces.<a href="5.html#6">5:6</a>

<p><li>God will burn the people to death for discovering his non-existence. <a href="5.html#14">5:14</a>

<p><li> God again talks of bringing a foreign nation to destroy his chosen ones and their lands.  
<a href="5.html#15">5:15-17</a>

<p><li>God just can't hold in his fury any longer. He will kill everyone: husbands and wives, children and old people.
<a href="6.html#11">6:11</a>

<p><li> God will punish the men by taking away their property, including their wives, and giving it to others.
 <a href="6.html#12">6:12</a>

<p><li> God plans to kill pretty much everyone: fathers and sons, 
family, friends, and neighbors. God plans to kill them all after laying a stumbling block before them.
 <a href="6.html#21">6:21</a>
 
<p><li>God will send soldiers from the north that will kill everyone and 
have no mercy. <a href="6.html#22">6:22-23</a>

<p><li> God will pour out his anger on both man and beast. Not even the trees will 
be spared from his wrath. And the ground itself will burn forever.  <a href="7.html#20">7:20</a>

<p><li> God will feed the people to the birds and the beasts, &quot;and none shall fray 
them away.&quot;&nbsp;  <a href="7.html#33">7:33</a>

<p><li> God will cover the earth with dead bodies that will not be buried. "They shall be for dung 
upon the face of the earth."  <a href="8.html#2">8:2</a>

<p><li> People will choose to kill themselves, rather than be killed by their vicious 
God.  <a href="8.html#3">8:3</a>

<p><li> God will give the people bad food and water, and then kill them with a 
sword. <a href="9.html#15">9:15-16</a>

<p><li> God will kill children and young men, and the dead bodies "shall fall as dung .... and none shall 
gather them."  <a href="9.html#21">9:21-22</a>

<p><li> "Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all them which are circumcised with the 
uncircumcised."  I guess that'd include just about everyone -- well, all the men 
anyway.  <a href="9.html#25">9:25-26</a>

<p><li> Jeremiah prays for the destruction of people and families that don't call on God's name. 
<a href="10.html#25">10:25</a>

<p><li> God &quot;will bring evil upon&quot; people from which they will not be able to escape. And if they 
cry out to him for help, he will not help them.  <a href="11.html#11">11:11</a>

<p><li> God forbids others from praying for his victims. Such prayers would go unanswered anyway, he says, 
because he &quot;will not hear them in their time of trouble.&quot;  <a href="11.html#14">11:14</a>

<p><li> God will punish the people by killing their young men in war and starving their children to death.  <a href="11.html#22">11:22</a>
<p><li> Jeremiah asks God to drag away his enemies like &quot;sheep for the slaughter.&quot;&nbsp; 
<a href="12.html#3">12:3</a>

<p><li>God delivered his people "into the hand of her enemies." He "hates" his "dearly 
beloved" people and plans to feed them to the birds. <a href="12.html#7">12:7-9</a>

<p><li> God's sword will "devour" everyone until "no flesh shall have peace." <a href="12.html#12">12:12</a>

<p><li> If any nation does not listen to God, he "will utterly pluck up and destroy that 
nation." <a href="12.html#17">12:17</a>

<p><li> God plans to make everyone in the kingdom drunk and then "dash the fathers and the sons 
together." The merciful God of peace vows to "not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy them."  <a href="13.html#12">13:12-14</a>

<p><li>God tells Jeremiah not to pray for the people. God has decided to kill them all and he doesn't want to 
be talked out of it. <a href="14.html#11">14:11</a>

<p><li> God will ignore the peoples' prayers, and kill them all with war, starvation, and disease.
  <a href="14.html#12">14:12</a>
  
<p><li> God will destroy by famine and sword those who are misled by the prophets, as well as the prophets 
themselves.  <a href="14.html#15">14:15-16</a>

<p><li>God tells Jeremiah not to bother praying for the people. Even if Moses and Samuel (and 
Jesus?) were to ask him to reconsider, he wouldn't. He's going to kill everybody and nobody can stop him!
<a href="15.html#1">15:1</a>

<p><li>God has it all planned out. He'll kill some with the sword, some with famine, and he'll feed the rest to the dogs and birds. 
Why will he do these terrible things? Because of something a former king did.  <a href="15.html#2">15:2-4</a>

<p><li> God again threatens Jerusalem with mass destruction.  Here are some of the highlights: 
He will kill children, make more widows than there are grains of 
sand, terrorize cities, and then kill the survivors. <a href="15.html#7">15:7-9</a>

<p><li> "A fire is kindled in mine anger, which shall burn upon you." <a href="15.html#14">15:14</a>

<p><li> God tells Jeremiah not to get married or have children, because he's 
going to kill everyone (mothers and daughters, fathers and sons). They all &quot;shall die of grievous 
deaths,&quot; and that shall neither &quot;be lamented&quot; nor buried, but &quot;shall 
be as dung upon the face of the earth.&quot;  For he has removed peace, "lovingkindness," and mercy 
from the people.  <a href="16.html#1">16:1-7</a>

<p><li> God will kill children if their parents worship other gods. <a href="16.html#10">16:10-11</a>

<p><li> If you don't honor the Sabbath, God will burn you to death unquenchable fire. 
<a href="17.html#27">17:27</a>

<p><li> God admits that he does evil things to people.  <a href="18.html#11">18:11</a>

<p><li> Jeremiah asks God to kill the young men in war and the children by starvation.  
<a href="18.html#21">18:21</a>

<p><li> God will do so much evil to the people that whoever hears of it will have their ears tingle.  
<a href="19.html#3">19:3</a>

<p><li> God will make parents eat their own children, and friends eat each other. <a href="19.html#7">19:7-9</a>

<p><li>God will break those who worship other gods as though they were made of clay, killing 
so many that there will not be enough room to bury them all. <a href="19.html#11">19:11-13</a>

<p><li>"Thus saith the LORD ... I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against
    it, because they have hardened their necks, that they might not hear my words." <a href="19.html#15">19:15</a>

<p><li>Jeremiah prophesies his rival's death (along with his famly and friends). <a href="20.html#4">20:4-6</a>
    
<p><li> God himself will fight and kill everyone in fury "with an outstretched hand and 
with a strong arm."  <a href="21.html#5">21:5</a>

<p><li>"I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great
    pestilence." <a href="21.html#6">21:6</a>
    
<p><li> God will deliver Zedekiah and those that survive the famine, disease, and war into Nebuchadrezzar's hand, 
and &quot;he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither
have pity, nor have mercy.  <a href="21.html#7">21:7</a>

<p><li>  God tells the Judeans to either surrender to the Babylonians and become their slaves or die.  
"Behold, I am against thee."  No kidding.  <a href="21.html#9">21:9-13</a>

<p><li>God will have Jeconiah's enemies kill him and his mother and then 
ensure that he die without leaving any sons. <a href="22.html#25">22:25-30</a>
 
<p><li> God promises to kill everyone by war, starvation, and disease.  <a href="24.html#10">24:10</a>

<p><li>Because the people of Judah were unfaithful to him, God will send the king of Babylon (Nebuchadrezzar) to destroy 
Jerusalem and enslave Judah. <a href="25.html#6">25:6-11</a>

<p><li>God will force "all the kingdoms of the world" to drink "and be 
drunken." Then he'll kill "all the inhabitants of the earth" with a sword. <a href="25.html#15">25:15-29</a>

<p><li>God is really getting into all of this killing. He roars, he mightily roars, and shouts. He "pleads with all flesh" 
while an whirlwind roars and a noise can be heard everywhere on earth. <a href="25.html#30">25:30-32</a>

<p><li> God will kill so many people that the entire earth will be covered with their dead bodies. No one is to 
mourn them or even bury them; &quot;they shall be dung upon the ground.&quot;  <a href="25.html#31">25:33-39</a>

<p><li>God will destroy "the peaceable habitations" and make the land desolate "because of his fierce anger." 
<a href="25.html#37">25:37-38</a>

<p><li> Anyone who disobeys King Nebuchadnezzar will be punished "with the sword, and with the famine, and 
with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand."  <a href="27.html#8">27:8</a>

<p><li>God kills Hananiah for disagreeing with Jeremiah. <a href="28.html#16">28:16-17</a>

<p><li> God will send his usual blessings upon his people: &quot;the sword, the famine, and the 
pestilence.&quot; He &quot;will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so 
evil.&quot;  <a href="29.html#17">29:17-18</a>

<p><li>God will kill those who refuse listen to his prophets. <a href="29.html#19">29:19</a>

<p><li> God will deliver Ahab and Zedekiah into the hands of Nebuchadrezzar &quot;and he shall slay them 
before your eyes&quot; and Ahab will be "roasted 
in the fire."  <a href="29.html#21">29:21-22</a>

<p><li>"Thus saith the LORD ... concerning this city [Jerusalem]...It shall be delivered into the hand 
    of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence." <a href="32.html#36">32:36</a>

<p><li> God litters the ground "with the dead bodies of men" that he has killed in 
his anger and fury. <a href="33.html#5">33:5</a>

<p><li>To punish the people for refusing to free their slaves, God over-reacts (just a tad) by 
threatening to send the sword, pestilence, and 
famine, saying he'll feed their dead bodies to the fowls and beasts of the earth. <a href="34.html#17">34:17-20</a>

<p><li> All those who move to Egypt will die by the sword, famine, or pestilence. None &quot;shall 
escape from the evil&quot; that comes directly from God. But many, including Jews, have moved to Egypt 
and most seem to have escaped from God's promised evil.  <a href="42.html#15">42:15-18, 22</a>

<p><li>God's not finished with Judah. He'll bring more evil upon them. Even those Jews that flee to Egypt will not be spared. 
God will hunt them down and kill them all with war, famine, and disease.   <a href="44.html#11">44:11-13</a>

<p><li>"I will watch over them for evil, and not for good." So begins another pronouncement of death and destruction on his chosen people. 
<a href="44.html#27">44:27-29</a>

<p><li>God says he will bring evil upon all flesh. <a href="45.html#5">45:5</a>

<p><li>"I ... will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof." <a href="46.html#8">46:8</a>

<p><li> The day of the Lord will be "a day of vengeance" On that day God's sword will become drunk with blood.  <a href="46.html#10">46:10</a>

<p><li>"The sword shall devour round about thee." <a href="46.html#14">46:14</a>

<p><li>"Why are thy valiant men swept away? ... because the Lord ... 
    made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another." <a href="46.html#15">46:15-16</a>

<p><li> God plans to drown the Philistines in a flood, and &quot;all the men shall cry, and all the 
inhabitants of the land shall howl.&quot;   <a href="47.html#2">47:2</a>

<p><li> God plans to kill just about everybody. "No city shall escape." <a href="48.html#8">48:8</a>

<p><li>"Cursed by he that keepeth back his sword from blood." <a href="48.html#10">48:10</a>

<p><li> God will destroy everyone in Moab. Fire will burn their heads, 
and their sons and daughters will be taken captive. <a href="48.html#42">48:42-46</a>

<p><li>God will cause the daughters of the Ammonites to be burned with fire. <a href="49.html#2">49:2</a>

<p><li>God will expose Esau's "secret places" and spoil his seed (kill his children). <a href="49.html#10">49:10</a>

<p><li> God will send such marvelous plagues on Edom that everyone will hiss in astonishment. <a href="49.html#17">49:17</a>

<p><li>God will kill the young men of Damascus and set the city on fire. (Some Christians believe this prophecy is being fulfulled today in Syrian civil war.) <a href="49.html#26">49:26-27</a>

<p><li> God plans to "bring evil upon" the people of Elam. He says he'll kill them all with a sword.  
<a href="49.html#37">49:37</a>

<p><li>"Every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues." <a href="50.html#13">50:13</a>

<p><li>"Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: 
for she hath sinned against the LORD." <a href="50.html#14">50:14</a>

<p><li>"It is the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her." <a href="50.html#15">50:15</a>

<p><li> God says to do the usual thing to the inhabitants of "the land of Merathaim": kill them all.  <a href="50.html#21">50:21</a>

<p><li>"I have laid a snare for thee ... O Babylon, and thou wast not aware ... because thou hast striven against the LORD."
<a href="50.html#24">50:24</a>

<p><li>"The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord."  
<a href="50.html#25">50:25</a>

<p><li>"Destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left." <a href="50.html#26">50:26</a>

<p><li>"Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them!" <a href="50.html#27">50:27</a>

<p><li>Call together the archers against Babylon ... let none thereof escape." <a href="50.html#29">50:29</a>

<p><li>Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD." 
<a href="50.html#30">50:30</a>

<p><li> God, the pyromaniac, will personally set the fires that will 
burn to death the inhabitants of entire cities. <a href="50.html#32">50:32</a>

<p><li>"Let the archer bend his bow ...and spare ye not her young men; destroy ye utterly all her host." <a href="51.html#3">51:3</a>

<p><li>"The slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and they that are thrust through in her streets." <a href="51.html#4">51:4</a>

<p><li>"This is the time of the LORD's vengeance; he will render unto her a recompence." <a href="51.html#6">51:6</a>

<p><li>"Babylon hath been a golden cup in the LORD's hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; 
therefore the nations are mad." <a href="51.html#7">51:7</a>
