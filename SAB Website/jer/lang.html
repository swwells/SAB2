<p><li>Jeremiah insults people by calling them "harlots" who have sex on every hill and 
under every tree. <a href="2.html#20">2:20</a>

<p><li> God compares Jerusalem's sinful ways to a promiscuous woman, or a wild donkey in heat.  
<a href="2.html#24">2:24</a>

<p><li>"Thou hast played the harlot with many lovers." <a href="3.html#1">3:1</a>

<p><li> "See where thou hast not been lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them ... and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms."
 <a href="3.html#2">3:2</a>

<p><li> "Thou hadst a whore's forehead."<br>
Jeremiah loves to insult people. His favorite insult is to call someone a whore. <a href="3.html#3">3:3</a>

<p><li>"She is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath played the harlot." <a href="3.html#6">3:6</a>

<p><li>Judah commits adultery with &quot;stocks and stones.&quot; <a href="3.html#9">3:9</a>
 
<p><li>"Thou ... hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree." <a href="3.html#13">3:13</a>

<p><li>"Circumcise the foreskin of your heart" or God will burn you to death. <a href="4.html#4">4:4</a>

<p><li>"As fed horses in the morning: everyone neighed after his neighbor's wife." <a href="5.html#8">5:8</a>

<p><li> &quot;Behold, their ear is uncircumcised.&quot;  <a href="6.html#10">6:10</a>

<p><li> God will cover the earth with dead bodies that
will not be buried. &quot;They shall be for dung upon the face of the
earth.&quot; <a href="8.html#2">8:2</a>

<p><li>Don't just circumcise your penis. Circumcise you heart as well. <a href="9.html#26">9:26</a>

<p><li>"For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered, and thy heels made bare." <a href="13.html#22">13:22</a>

<p><li>God plans to expose Jerusalem's private parts to the world by lifting her skirt over her head, so to speak. He's seen
her commit whoredoms and abominations and whatnot on the hills, and he's getting darned sick of it! 
<a href="13.html#26">13:26-27</a>

<p><li>God tells Jeremiah not to get married or have children, because he's 
going to kill everyone (mothers and daughters, fathers and sons). They all "shall die of grievous 
deaths," and that shall neither "be lamented" nor buried, but "shall be as dung upon the face of the earth."  
 <a href="16.html#1">16:1-7</a>

<p><li>"Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue, and fall, 
and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you." <a href="25.html#27">27:27</a>

<p><li> God will kill so many people that the entire earth will be covered with their dead bodies. No one is to 
mourn them or even bury them; &quot;they shall be dung upon the ground.&quot; 
<a href="16.html#4">16:4</a>, <a href="25.html#31">25:31-33</a>

<p><li> Jeremiah asks God to make Moab drunk, and predicts that Moab will &quot;wallow in his
