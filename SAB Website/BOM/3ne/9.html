burnt offerings shall be done away, for I will accept none of your sacrifices and your burnt offerings.

cometh unto me with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, him will I baptize with fire and with the Holy 
Ghost, even as the Lamanites, because of their faith in me at the time of their conversion, were baptized 
with fire and with the Holy Ghost, and they knew it not.

therefore repent, and come unto me ye ends of the earth, and be saved. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>
