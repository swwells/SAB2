of vipers." <a href="3.html#7">3:7</a>

<p><li>Those who bear bad fruit will be cut down and burned "with unquenchable fire."  <a href="3.html#10">3:10, 12</a>

<p><li>Jesus tells his disciples to keep away from
the Gentiles and Samaritans, and go only to the Israelites. <a href="10.html#5">10:5-6</a>

<p><li>Cities that neither &quot;receive&quot;
the disciples nor &quot;hear&quot; their words will be destroyed by God. It will
be worse for them than for Sodom and Gomorrah. And you know what God supposedly
did to those poor folks (see <A href="../gen/19.html#24">Gen 19:24</A>).
 <a href="10.html#14">10:14-15</a>
 
 <p><li>Families will be torn apart because of Jesus (this is one of the few "prophecies" in the Bible that has actually come

and cause them to be put to death."  <a href="10.html#21">10:21</a>

<a href="10.html#33">10:33</a>

send peace, but a sword."  <a href="10.html#34">10:34-36</a>

<p><li>Jesus condemns entire cities to dreadful deaths and to the eternal torment of hell because they didn't care for his
preaching.  <a href="11.html#20">11:20-24</a>

<p><li>"He that is not with me is against me." <a href="12.html#30">12:30</a>

<p><li>"Whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him." <a href="12.html#31">12:31-32</a>

<p><li>Jesus will send his angels to gather up "all that offend" and they "shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there
shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth."  <a href="13.html#41">13:41-42, 50</a>

<p><li>Jesus refuses to heal the Canaanite woman's possessed daughter, saying &quot;it is not meet to
take the children's bread, and to cast it to the dogs.&quot; <a href="15.html#22">15:22-26</a>

<p><li>The ever-so-kind Jesus calls the Pharisees "hypocrites, wicked, and adulterous." Why? For asking for some 
evidence that Jesus is who he claims to be.  <a href="16.html#3">16:3-4</a>

 <p><li>"Whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder."

<a href="21.html#44">21:44</a>
 
 <p><li>In the parable of the marriage feast, the king sends his servants to gather everyone they can find, both bad and

into the outer darkness" where "there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth." 
<a href="22.html#1">22:1-14</a>

 <a href="23.html#31">23:31</a>
