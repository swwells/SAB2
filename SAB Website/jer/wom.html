<p><li>Jeremiah insults people by calling them "harlots" who have sex on every hill and 
under every tree. <a href="2.html#20">2:20</a>

<p><li> God compares Jerusalem's sinful ways to a promiscuous woman, or a wild donkey in heat.  <a href="2.html#24">2:24</a>

<p><li>  "Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire?" This is meant to be a 
rhetorical question with an obvious answer: Of course not; women think only about their clothes. <a href="2.html#32">2:32</a>

<p><li> A divorced woman is "polluted" when she remarries. The man, of course, remains perfectly

<p><li> "See where thou hast not been lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them ... and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms."
 <a href="3.html#2">3:2</a>

<p><li> "Thou hadst a whore's forehead."<br>
Jeremiah loves to insult people. His favorite insult is to call someone a whore. <a href="3.html#3">3:3</a>

<p><li>"As a wife treacherously departeth from her husband...."<br>
If a woman leaves her husband, she is "treacherous," but a man is blameless when he "puts her away" for no 
reason. <a href="3.html#20">3:20</a>

<p><li> God will punish the men by taking away their property, including their wives, and giving it to others.
 <a href="6.html#12">6:12</a>

<p><li>To punish the men, God will "give their wives to others." <a href="8.html#10">8:10</a>

<p><li>"For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered, and thy heels made bare." <a href="13.html#22">13:22</a>

<p><li>God plans to expose Jerusalem's private parts to the world by 
lifting her skirt over her head, so to speak. He's seen her commit whoredoms and abominations and 
whatnot on the hills, and he's getting darned sick of it! <a href="13.html#26">13:26-27</a>

<p><li>"The virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing." (She fucked another god.) <a href="18.html#13">18:13</a>

<p><li>"The mighty men of Babylon have ... became as women." <a href="51.html#30">51:30</a>
