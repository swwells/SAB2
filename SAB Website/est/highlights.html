  when they are all drunk, he orders Queen Vashti to show her stuff before him and his guests. <a href="1.html#7">1:7-11</a>
  
  <p><li>Queen Vashti (the real heroine of the Book of Esther) refuses to display
    herself in front of the king's drunken guests. <A href="1.html#7">1:7-12</A>
    
  <p><li>For her refusal, Vashti is stripped of her crown and came "no more before king." <A href="1.html#13">1:13-19</A>
  
  <p><li>Because of Vashti's disobedience the king decrees that &quot;all the wives
    shall give to their husbands honor&quot; and &quot;that every man should
    bear rule over his own house.&quot; <A href="1.html#20">1:20-22</A>
    
  <p><li>&quot;All the fair young virgins&quot; throughout the kingdom are brought
    before the king and the one that &quot;pleaseth&quot; him the most will replace Queen Vashti. <A href="2.html#2">2:2-4</A>
    
  <p><li>Esther wins the pleasing the king babe contest. <A href="2.html#8">2:8-9</A>
  
  <p><li>But since women are dirty, she must be &quot;purified&quot; for twelve
    months before she can be made queen. <A href="2.html#12"  >2:12</A>
    
 <p><li>Esther has Haman and his ten sons hung. <A href="7.html#10"  >7:10</A>, <A href="9.html#13"  >9:13</A>
 
 <p><li>At Esther's request, the king orders everyone in the empire who planned to kill Jews to be killed by Jews, 
 along with their wives and children. <a href="8.html#9">8:9-19</a>
 
 <p><li>The Jews kill everyone who ever had a bad thought toward them, along with their Jew-hating families. <a href="9.html#1">9:1-16</a>
