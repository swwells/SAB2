<p><li>The existence and nature of God are self-evident; thus, unbelievers are "without
excuse." <a href="1.html#20">1:20</a>

<p><li>Atheists have dark and foolish hearts. <a href="1.html#21">1:21</a>

<p><li>God abandons those who don't know him to "uncleanness and vile affections." 
<a href="1.html#24">1:24, 26, 28</a>

<p><li>With his usual intolerance, Paul condemns homosexuals (including lesbians). This is the only clear reference to
lesbians in the Bible. <a href="1.html#26">1:26-28</a>

<p><li> Homosexuals (those "without natural affection") and their supporters (those "that have pleasure in them") are
"worthy of death."  <a href="1.html#31">1:31-32</a>

<p><li>Paul says that those who accuse him of lying deserve damnation. <a href="3.html#8">3:8</a>

<p><li>God blinded the Jews so they wouldn't recognize Jesus as the Messiah. <a href="11.html#7">11:7-10</a>, <a href="11.html#25">25</a>

<p><li>"As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, 
they are beloved for the father's sakes."<br>
Jews are enemies to Christians, but God loves them  for their ancestors' sake. <a href="11.html#28">11:28</a>

<p><li>Gentiles used to be unbelievers, but now the Jews are the unbelievers and God saves gentiles through Jewish unbelief. It's all a part of 
God's plan. <a href="11.html#30">11:30</a>

<p><li>"He that doubteth is damned ... Whosoever is not of faith is sin." <a href="14.html#23">14:23</a>

<p><li>Shun those who disagree with your religious views. <a href="16.html#17">16:17</a>
