    unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes."</I> -- <a href="19.html#8">Genesis 19:8</a>

<H3>Genesis for Skeptics</H3>

<p>Genesis has it all: sex, violence, contradictions, insults to women, absurdities, conflicts with science and history, you 
name it. Well, except for anything  good, that is. God declared his creation to be "very good" in <a href="1.html#31">1:31</a>, 
but I can't find anything good in Genesis.

 God says that if Adam eats from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, then the day that he does so, he will die. But 
Adam eats the forbidden fruit (<a href="3.html#6">3:6</a>) and yet lives for another 930 years (<a href="5.html#5">5:5</a>).

God expels Adam and Eve from the garden before they get a chance to eat from that other tree -- the tree of life. 
God knows that if they do that, they will live forever. A spooky thought indeed for an insecure god.

  (1:1-2:3) <b><i>"In the beginning"</i></b><br>
  The first of two contradictory creation accounts. Compare
with <A href="2.html#4">Genesis 2:4-25</A> in which the order of events is entirely different.<br>
<A href="../contra/accounts.html">The two creations</a><br>
<a href="../contra/who_created.html">Who created heaven and earth?</a><br>
  <a href="../interp/universe.html">When was the universe created?</a><br>
  <a href="../interp/gap.html">The Gap Theory</a>

<p>(1:1-2:3) The Genesis 1 account conflicts with the order of
events that are known to science. 

<p>In Genesis 1:1, the earth and "heaven" are created together "in the beginning," whereas according to 
current estimates, the earth and universe are about 4.6  and 13.7 billion years old, respectively.

<p>In Genesis, the earth is created (1:1) before light (1:3), sun and stars (1:16); birds and whales (1:21) before reptiles and 
insects (1:24); and flowering plants (1:11) before any animals (1:20). The order of events known from science is in each case just the opposite.
  
 <p>(1:3-5, 14-19) <i>"Let there be light"</i><br>God creates light and separates light from darkness, and day from 
night, on the first day. Yet he didn't make the light producing objects (the sun and the stars) until the fourth 
day (<A href="#14">1:14-19</A>). And how could there be &quot;the evening and the morning&quot; on the first 
day if there was no sun to mark them?

<p>(1:6-8) <i><a href="../topics/firmament.html">The Firmament</a></i> (Heaven) <br>God spends one-sixth of his entire creative 
effort (the second day) working on a solid firmament. This strange structure, 
which God calls heaven, is intended to separate the higher waters from the lower 
waters.

<p>(1:11-13) <i>"Let the earth bring forth grass"</i><br>Plants are made on the third day before there was a sun
to drive their photosynthetic processes (<A href="#14">1:14-19</A>). 
Notice, though, that God lets &quot;the earth bring forth&quot; the plants, rather than 
creating them directly. Maybe Genesis is not so anti-evolution after all.<br>
<A href="../contra/plants.html">Were plants created before or after humans?</a> <br>
<a href="../interp/evolution.html">Does the Bible teach evolution?</a> 

<p>(1:14) <i>"Let them be for signs"</i><br>
God placed the sun, moon, and stars in the firmament so that they can be used "for signs". This, of course, is exactly what astrologers do: read "the signs" in the 
Zodiac to predict what will happen on Earth.<br>
 <a href="../contra/astrology.html">Does the bible condemn astrology?</a><br>
 <a href="../says_about/astrology.html">What the Bible says about astrology</a>
 
 <p>(1:16a) <i>"God made the two great lights."</i><br>
"The greater light [the sun] to rule the day, and the lesser light [the moon] to rule the night." But the moon is not a light; it only reflects 
light from the sun. And why, if God made the moon to "rule the night", does it spend half of its time moving through the daytime sky?
  
  <p>(1:16b) <i>"He made the stars also."</i><br>
God spends a day making light (before making the sun and stars) and separating light from darkness; then, at the end of a hard day's work, 
and almost as an afterthought, he makes <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/01/number-of-stars-in-universe_n_790563.html">300 sextillion stars</a>. <br>
<a href="../contra/stars_made.html" >When were the stars made?</a>

 <p>(1:17) <i>"God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light 
upon the earth."</i><br>Then why is only a tiny fraction of stars visible from earth? Under the 
best conditions, no more than a few thousand stars are visible with the unaided eye, yet there 
are hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy and a hundred billion or so galaxies. Were they 
all created "to give light upon the earth"?

<p>(1:20) <i>"Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl."</i><br>
     <a href="../contra/animals.html">From what were the animals created?</a><br>
  <a href="../contra/fowl.html">From what were the fowls created?</a>
  
  <p>(1:24) <i>"Let the earth bring forth the living creature."</i><br>
<a href="../interp/evolution.html" >Does the Bible teach evolution?</a>

  <p>(1:25)  <i>"God made the beast of the earth."</i>  <br> 
<A href="../contra/humans.html" >Were humans created before the other animals?</a><br>
<a href="../interp/beasts.html">"The beast of the earth"</a>

<p>(1:26a) <i>"Let us make man in our image."</i><br>
<A href="../contra/gods.html" >How many gods are there?</a><br>

<p>(1:26b) <i>"Let them have dominion ... over all the earth."</a></i> <br>
God gave humans dominion over every other living thing on earth. This couldn't be true, of course, 
since millions of other species existed for millions of years before humans existed. But this verse is used by fundamentalist Christians to justify their mistreatment of other species and disregard for the environment. After all, they believe that God created the other species just for them, so they can do whatever they please with them.

<p>(1:27) <i>"Male and female created he them."</i><br>
<a href="../interp/adam.html" >When was Adam created?</a><br>
<a href="../contra/eve.html">When was Eve created?</a><br>
<a href="../interp/male_and_female.html">Is God both male and female?</a><br>
<a href="../interp/preadamites.html">The Pre-Adamites</a>

<p><img src="../images/pol.gif"> (1:28) <i>"Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have
     dominion over ... every living thing that moveth upon the earth."</i> <br>
     God commands us to "be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over ... 
     every living thing that moveth upon the earth." 
     This verse is used to justify Christian opposition to birth control, concern for the environment, and animal rights. 
     The earth was made for humans, and they can do as they damn well please with it.<br>
<a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ann_Coulter#On_the_environment">Ann Coulter</a> says, presumably using this verse as for justification,
"God gave us the earth. We have dominion over the plants, the animals, the trees. God said, 'Earth is yours. Take it. Rape it. It's yours.'"<br>
  <a href="../says_about/birth_control.html">What the Bible says about birth control</a><br>
  <a href="../contra/childbearing.html">Is childbearing sinful?</a>
  
  <p>(1:29)  <i>"I have given you every herb ... and every tree ... for meat."</i><br>
  Since many plants have evolved poisons to protect against animals that would like to eat them, God's advice is more than a little reckless. 
  Would you tell your children to go out in the garden and eat whatever plants they encounter? Of course not. But then, you are much nicer and smarter than God.
  <a href="../contra/tree.html" >May Adam eat from any tree?</a> <br>
  <a href="../contra/eat.html">What should we eat?</a><br>
  <a href="../interp/420.html">Is it okay to smoke marijuana?</a> 
  
  <p>(1:30)  <i>"To every beast ... I have given every green herb for  meat."</i><br>
  All animals were originally herbivores. Tapeworms, vampire bats, mosquitoes, and barracudas -- all were strict vegetarians, as created by God.

<p>(1:31) <i><a href="1_31.html"><i>God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good."</i></a><br>
God purposefully designed a system that ensures the suffering and death of all his creatures, parasite and host, predator and prey.

God puts a mark on Cain so no one will kill him. Good idea. But it contradicts the law given in Gen.9:6 that says whoever kills shall be killed.<br>
 <a href="../contra/capital.html">Does God approve of capital punishment?</a>
 
 <p>Until the 1978 revelation to Mormon President, Spencer W. Kimball, black men were not allowed to hold the priesthood. 
 This was based, in part, on Genesis 4:15, where God placed a mark on Cain after he had killed his brother Abel. 
 Joseph Smith and later LDS leaders interpreted the "mark upon Cain" to be turning of Cain's skin (and that of all his descendents) black.

<p>It should be noted, however, that Mormons were not alone in this interpretation of Gen.4:15. Many Protestant denominations 
at the time Joseph Smith founded the LDS Church (1830) had the same racist understanding of the "mark of Cain."

 That's nice, but where the hell did she come from? "The Bible doesn't mention any of Cain's sisters. Well, maybe he married his mom, 
 or maybe God pulled another creation over in the next county. In any case, Cain and the mysterious Mrs. Cain have a son (another blue cigar!). 
 His name is Enoch and he builds a city (population 3).
 
<p>Although the Bible doesn't say where Mrs. Cain came from, Joseph Smith provided the answer 
in "<a href="http://www.centerplace.org/hs/iv/iv-gen.htm">The Inspired 
Version</a>" of the Bible, which was his very own "translation". Here's what it says: "And it came to pass, that Cain took one of his brother's daughters to wife, and they loved Satan more than 
God." – Gen.5:13

<p>So according to Joseph Smith (and he ought to know!) Cain married one
of his nieces. He doesn't say, though, which of Cain's brothers was Mrs. Cain's father.

<p>Another answer is provided by the <a href="../interp/preadamites.html">Pre-Adamite</a> theory.

Lamech kills a man and claims that since Cain's murderer would be punished sevenfold, whoever murders him will be
punished seventy-seven fold. That sounds fair.

Where'd he find his wife?
