<p><li>"Give me constancy in my mind, that I may despise him ... For this will be a glorious monument for thy name, when 
	he shall fall by the hand of a woman." <a href="9.html#14">9:14-15</a>

<p><li>God, the great beautician, made Judith more beautiful. Then she and her slave took a
 bottle of wine and left to visit Holofernes. On the way she passed by the Hebrew old men, who "admired her beauty exceedingly." 
 <a href="10.html#4">10:4-7</a>
 
 <p><li> Holofernes is totally incapacitated by Judith's beauty. His officers were too, who said,

<p><li>Judith shows off the head of Holofernes, assuring everyone that no sex was involved in the

<p><li>For cutting off the head of a drunken man as he slept, Judith is blessed by God "above all 
woman." (Even more blessed than Jael and Mary?) <a href="13.html#23">13:23-25</a>

<p><li>The Assyrian army ran away after hearing about the headless Holfernes, and the Israelites (with God's help) 
slaughtered them as they ran, taking all their stuff and giving it to Judith -- the forever blessed, glory of Jerusalem and joy of Israel. 
(God gave Judith the strength to behead a sleeping man to reward her for not having sex after her husband died.)

<p><li>Judith sings a song of praise to herself for cutting off a sleeping man's head. <a href="16.html#1">16:1-28</a>
