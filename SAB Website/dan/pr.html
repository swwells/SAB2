<p><li>To many endtimers, these verses describe the coming Antichrist.  However, it is more 
likely that they describe a tyrant king of Syria, Antiochus IV.  He reigned around 
170 BCE and persecuted the Jews, sparking the Maccabean revolt.  This information gives 
even more credence to the train of thought that has Daniel's writer living in the second 
century BCE, than in the sixth.  Which wouldn't make these verses prophecy; they would be 
contemporary history.  <a href="8.html#23">8:23-25</a>, <a href="11.html#21">11:21-45</a>

<p><li>The apocalyptic visions Daniel has seen are to be sealed up, to be opened after "many days."  
Many days have passed since this book was written, with nothing like what's described here going on.  
Also, it is interesting to note that the visions described 
in <a href="../rev/22.html#10">Revelation 22:10</a> are <I>not</I> to be sealed, since the time is 
supposedly near.  But even that book was written nearly 2,000 years ago.  So much for "near."

  <p><li>"I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it." (If Daniel couldn't understand his 
visions, then how could anyone else?) This is the one true prophecy in the book of 
Daniel: "none understood it." <a href="8.html#27">8:27</a>
