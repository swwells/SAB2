"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",
"<span class='i'>Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever.</span>--<a href='3.html#14'>Alma 3:14</a>",
"<span class='i'>I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</span>--<a href='3.html#15'>Alma 3:15</a>",
"<span class='I'>If ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd ... the devil is your shepherd.</span>--<a href='5.html#39'>Alma 5:39</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",
"<span class='a'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges ... even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year....</span>--<a href='16.html#1'>Alma 16:1</a>",
"<span class='a'>Their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.</span>--<a href='16.html#11'>Alma 16:11</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",
"<span class='v'>He [Ammon] smote off their arms with his sword; for he did withstand their blows by smiting their arms with the edge of his sword.</span>--<a href='17.html#37'>Alma 17:37</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.   Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</span>--<a href='30.html#22'>Alma 30:22</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",
"<span class='i'>God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.</span>--<a href='30.html#47'>Alma 30:47</a>",
"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Amalekites were of a more wicked and murderous disposition than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='43.html#6'>Alma 43:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lord is with us; and ye behold that he has delivered you into our hands.</span>--<a href='44.html#3'>Alma 44:3</a>",
"<span class='i'>God ... has strengthened  our arms that we have gained power over you, by  our faith, by our religion, and by our rites of worship, and by  our church.</span>--<a href='44.html#5'>Alma 44:5</a>",
"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",
"<span class='i'>These dissenters ... became ... more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='47.html#36'>Alma 47:36</a>",
"<span class='a'>God would prosper them in the land, or in other words ... God ... would prosper them in the land.</span>--<a href='48.html#15'>Alma 48:15</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='50.html#22'>Alma 50:22</a>",
"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",
"<span class='i'>The remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty.</span>--<a href='51.html#20'>Alma 51:20</a>",
"<span class='g'>And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye.</span>--<a href='54.html#21'>Alma 54:21</a>",
"<span class='v'>We did slay upwards of two thousand of them after they had surrendered themselves prisoners of war.</span>--<a href='57.html#14'>Alma 57:14</a>",

<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>32:1</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they did go forth, and began to preach the word of 
God unto the people, entering into their synagogues, and into their houses; yea, and even they did preach the word 
in their streets. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32"><a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a> (32:1, 2)
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>32:2</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that after much labor among them, they began to have 
success among the poor class of people; for behold, they were cast out of the synagogues because of the coarseness 
of their apparel --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>32:3</b>   Therefore they were not permitted to enter into their synagogues to worship God, being esteemed as 
filthiness; therefore they were poor; yea, they were esteemed by their brethren as dross; therefore they were poor 
as to things of the world; and also they were poor in heart. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>32:4</b>   Now, as Alma was teaching and speaking unto the people upon the hill Onidah, there came a great 
multitude unto him, who were those of whom we have been speaking, of whom were poor in heart, because of their 
poverty as to the things of the world. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>32:5</b>   And they came unto Alma; and the one who was the foremost among them said unto him: Behold, what 
shall these my brethren do, for they are despised of all men because of their poverty, yea, and more especially by 
our priests; for they have cast us out of our synagogues which we have labored abundantly to build with our own 
hands; and they have cast us out because of our <span class="a">exceeding</span> poverty; and we have no place to worship our God; and 
behold, what shall we do? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32"><a href="exceed_list.html">Exceedingly</a> (32:5, 12, 15)
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>32:6</b>   And now when Alma heard this, he turned him about, his face immediately towards him, and he beheld 
with great joy; for he beheld that their afflictions had truly humbled them and that they were in a preparation to 
hear the word. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>32:7</b>   Therefore he did say no more to the other multitude; but he stretched forth his hand, and cried unto 
those whom he beheld, who were truly penitent, and said unto them: <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>32:8</b>   I behold that ye are lowly in heart; and if so, blessed are ye. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>32:9</b>   Behold thy brother hath said, What shall we do? -- for we are cast out of our synagogues, that we 
cannot worship our God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>32:10</b>   Behold I say unto you, do ye suppose that ye cannot worship God save it be in your synagogues 
only? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>32:11</b>   Moreover, I would ask, do ye suppose that ye must not worship God only once in a week? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>32:12</b>   I say unto you, it is well that ye are cast out of your synagogues, that ye may be humble, and that 
ye may learn wisdom; for it is necessary that ye should learn wisdom; for it is because that ye are cast out, that ye 
are despised of your brethren because of your <span class="a">exceeding</span> poverty, that ye are brought to a lowliness of heart; for ye 
are necessarily brought to be humble. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>32:13</b>   And now, because ye are compelled to be humble blessed are ye; for a man sometimes, if he is 
compelled to be humble, seeketh repentance; and now surely, whosoever repenteth shall find mercy; and <span class="plag">he that 
findeth mercy and endureth to the end the same shall be saved.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/plag.gif" border="0" width="32" height="32"><font size="-1">
But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. -- <a href="../../mt/24.html#13">Matthew 24:13</a></font>

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>32:14</b>   And now, as I said unto you, that because ye were compelled to be humble ye were blessed, do ye 
not suppose that they are more blessed who truly humble themselves because of the word? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>32:15</b>   Yea, he that truly humbleth himself, and repenteth of his sins, and 
<span class="plag">endureth to the end, the same shall be blessed </span>-- yea, much more blessed than they who are compelled to be humble because of their 
<span class="a">exceeding</span> poverty. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/plag.gif" border="0" width="32" height="32"><font size="-1">
But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. -- <a href="../../mt/24.html#13">Matthew 24:13</a>
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>32:16</b>   Therefore, blessed are they who humble themselves without being compelled to be humble; or rather, 
in other words, blessed is he that believeth in the word of God, and is baptized without stubbornness of heart, yea, 
without being brought to know the word, or even compelled to know, before they will believe. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>32:17</b>   Yea, there are many who do say: If thou wilt show unto us a sign from heaven, then we shall know of 
a surety; then we shall believe. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>32:18</b>   Now I ask, is this faith?  Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for 
<span class="a">if a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee" rowspan="2">

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1">The Book of Mormon agrees with 
<a href="http://www.ariga.com/frosties/bunkerarchie.shtml">Archie Bunker</a>, who said: "It ain't supposed to make 
sense; it's faith. Faith is something that you believe that nobody in his right mind would believe."</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>32:19</b>   And now, how much more cursed is he that knoweth the will of God and doeth it not, than he that 
only believeth, or only hath cause to believe, and falleth into transgression? 

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>32:20</b>   Now of this thing ye must judge.  Behold, I say unto you, that it is on the one hand even as it 
is on the other; and it shall be unto every man according to his work. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>32:21</b>   And now as I said concerning faith -- faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of 
things; therefore <span class="plag">if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen</span>, which are true. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/plag.gif" border="0" width="32" height="32"><font size="-1">
Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
 -- <a href="../../heb/11.html#1">Hebrews 11:1</a></font>
 
<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>32:22</b>   And now, behold, I say unto you, and I would that ye should remember, that God is merciful unto all 
who believe on his name; therefore he desireth, in the first place, that ye should believe, yea, even on his word. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>32:23</b>   And now, he imparteth his word by angels unto men, yea, not only men but women also.  Now this is 
not all; little children do have words given unto them many times which confound the wise and the learned. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>32:24</b>   And now, my beloved brethren, as ye have desired to know of me what ye shall do because ye are 
afflicted and cast out -- now I do not desire that ye should suppose that I mean to judge you only according to 
that which is true --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>32:25</b>   For I do not mean that ye all of you have been compelled to humble yourselves; for I verily believe 
that there are some among you who would humble themselves, let them be in whatsoever circumstances they might. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>32:26</b>   Now, as I said concerning faith -- that it was not a perfect knowledge -- even so it is with my 
words.  Ye cannot know of their surety at first, unto perfection, any more than faith is a perfect knowledge. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>32:27</b>   But behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and 
exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you, 
even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>32:28</b>   Now, we will compare the word unto a seed.  Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in 
your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will 
resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these 
swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves -- It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that 
the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, 
it beginneth to be delicious to me. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>32:29</b>   Now behold, would not this increase your faith?  I say unto you, Yea; nevertheless it hath 
not grown up to a perfect knowledge. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>32:30</b>   But behold, as the seed swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, then you must needs 
say that the seed is good; for behold it swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow.   And now behold, will 
not this strengthen your faith?  Yea, it will strengthen your faith: for ye will say I know that this is a good 
seed; for behold it sprouteth and beginneth to grow. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>32:31</b>   And now, behold, are ye sure that this is a good seed?  I say unto you, Yea; for every seed 
bringeth forth unto its own likeness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="32"></a>32:32</b>   Therefore, if a seed groweth it is good, but if it groweth not, behold it is not good, therefore 
it is cast away. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="33"></a>32:33</b>   And now, behold, because ye have tried the experiment, and planted the seed, and it swelleth and 
sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, ye must needs know that the seed is good. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="34"></a>32:34</b>   And now, behold, is your knowledge perfect?  Yea, your knowledge is perfect in that thing, and your 
faith is dormant; and this because ye know, for ye know that the word hath swelled your souls, and ye also know that 
it hath sprouted up, that your understanding doth begin to be enlightened, and your mind doth begin to expand. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="35"></a>32:35</b>   O then, is not this real?  I say unto you, Yea, because it is light; and whatsoever is light, is 
good, because it is discernible, therefore ye must know that it is good; and now behold, after ye have tasted this 
light is your knowledge perfect? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="36"></a>32:36</b>   Behold I say unto you, Nay; neither must ye lay aside your faith, for ye have only exercised your 
faith to plant the seed that ye might <span class="a">try the experiment to know if the seed was good.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1">When it comes to religion, Mormons believe in experimenting. Just believe and see what happens. If it feels good, believe it.</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="37"></a>32:37</b>   And behold, as the tree beginneth to grow, ye will say: Let us nourish it with great care, that 
it may get root, that it may grow up, and bring forth fruit unto us.  And now behold, if ye nourish it with much 
care it will get root, and grow up, and bring forth fruit. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="38"></a>32:38</b>   But if ye neglect the tree, and take no thought for its nourishment, behold it will not get 
any root; <span class="plag">and when the heat of the sun cometh and scorcheth it, because it hath no root it withers away</span>, and ye 
pluck it up and cast it out. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/plag.gif" border="0" width="32" height="32"><font size="-1">
And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.
 -- <a href="../../mt/13.html#6">Matthew 13:6</a></font>
 
<tr><td><b><a name="39"></a>32:39</b>   Now, this is not because the seed was not good, neither is it because the fruit thereof would not 
be desirable; but it is because your ground is barren, and ye will not nourish the tree, therefore ye cannot have 
the fruit thereof. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="40"></a>32:40</b>   And thus, if ye will not nourish the word, looking forward with an eye of faith to the fruit 
thereof, ye can never pluck of the fruit of the tree of life. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="41"></a>32:41</b>   But if ye will nourish the word, yea, nourish the tree as it beginneth to grow, by your faith 
with great diligence, and with patience, looking forward to the fruit thereof, it shall take root; and behold it 
shall be a tree <span class="plag">springing up unto everlasting life.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/plag.gif" border="0" width="32" height="32"><font size="-1">
A well of water springing up into everlasting life -- <a href="../../jn/4.html#14">John 4:14</a></font>

<tr><td><b><a name="42"></a>32:42</b>   And because of your diligence and your faith and your patience with the word in nourishing it, 
that it may take root in you, behold, by and by ye shall pluck the fruit thereof, which is most precious, which 
is sweet above all that is sweet, and which is white above all that is white, yea, and pure above all that is 
pure; and ye shall feast upon this fruit even until ye are filled, that ye hunger not, neither shall ye thirst. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="43"></a>32:43</b>   Then, my brethren, ye shall reap the rewards of your faith, and your diligence, and patience, and 
long-suffering, waiting for the tree to bring forth fruit unto you. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
