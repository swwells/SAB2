If a man dies before his wife has a child,
then the widow must marry her husband's brother -- whether she likes him or not,
and whether she wants to or not. If the he refuses to "go in unto" his dead brother's wife, the 
she must loosen his shoe and spit in his face.

<p>(25:5) <i>"If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall 
not marry without unto a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband's brother unto her."</i>

<p>(25:7) <i>"And if the man like not to take his brother's wife, then let his brother's wife go up to the gate unto the elders, 
and say, My husband's brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, he will not perform the duty of my husband's brother."</i>

suckling." (<A href="../1sam/15.html#2">1 Sam.15:2-3</A>)
