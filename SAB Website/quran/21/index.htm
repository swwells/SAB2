Never cometh there unto them a new reminder from their Lord but they listen  to it while they play, <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

With hearts preoccupied. And they confer in secret. The wrong-doers say: Is  this other than a mortal like you ? Will ye then succumb to magic when ye see (it) ? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="4"><b>21:4</a></b>
He saith: My Lord knoweth what is spoken in the heaven and the earth. He is  the Hearer, the Knower. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Nay, say they, <span class="a">(these are but) muddled dreams; nay, he hath but invented it</span>;  nay, he is but a poet. Let him bring us a portent even as those of old (who were God's  messengers) were sent (with portents).

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (21:5) <i>"These are but muddled dreams; nay, he hath but invented it."</i><br>
Muhammad's critics claimed that his supposed revelations were "muddled dreams" that he made up as he went along.

And We sent not (as Our messengers) before thee other than men, whom We  inspired. Ask the followers of the Reminder if ye know not ?

We gave them not bodies that would not eat food, nor were they immortals. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Then we fulfilled the promise unto them. So we delivered them and whom  We would, and We destroyed the prodigals. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Now We have revealed unto you a Scripture wherein is your Reminder. Have  ye then no sense ? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

How many a community that dealt unjustly have We shattered, and raised up  after them another folk! <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

The sun, stars, and earth were joined together until Allah separated them (about six thousand years ago).
