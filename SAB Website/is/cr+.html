<p><li>&quot;And ... instead of a sweet smell there
shall be stink,&quot; with people suffering from baldness and burnings, and the men killed with 
swords. <a href="3.html#24">3:24-25</a>

<p><li>After God "washed away the filth" from the women and killed the men, he set up 
"a cloud and smoke by day" and a "flaming fire by night." <a href="4.html#4">4:4-5</a>

<p><li>God will kill those who despise his word and fail to follow his laws. Their 
carcasses will be "torn in the midst of the streets." <a href="5.html#24">5:24-25</a>

<p><li>God will have no mercy on the widows and children of hypocrites. <a href="9.html#17">9:17</a>

<p><li>God will make every man kill his brother and then force him to eat "the flesh of his own arm."  
<a href="9.html#19">9:19-20</a>

<p><li>God will "smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall slay the wicked." 
<a href="11.html#4">11:4</a>

<p><li>"I have commanded my sanctified ones ... to destroy the whole land." God has his holy ones do 
his dirty work for him. <a href="13.html#3">13:3-5</a>

<p><li>On God's day he will kill sinners with great anger, wrath, and cruelty.  Those who die will have their faces consumed by flames.
<a href="13.html#6">13:6-9</a>

<p><li>If God can find you, he will "thrust you through," smash your children "to pieces" before your eyes, and rape your wife.
He will have no mercy, but will even kill your little children.  <a href="13.html#15">13:15-18</a>

<p><li>God will slaughter children "for the iniquity of their fathers." <a href="14.html#21">14:21</a>

<p><li>After God destroys Moab, the rivers will be red with blood. He will send lions to 
eat any survivors. <a href="15.html#9">15:9</a>

<p><li>The Apocalypse of Isaiah: God will destroy the earth, burning everyone and every living thing 
alive (except maybe a few men). <a href="24.html#1">24:1-6</a>

<p><li>"And the people shall ... be burned in the fire." <a href="33.html#12">33:12</a>

<p><li>God is furious at everyone and is ready to kill them all. Or as Isaiah so delicately puts it: "Their stink shall come up
out of their carcasses, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood."  <a href="34.html#2">34:2-3</a>

<p><li>God's sword "will be bathed in heaven." Sounds like a place to stay away from.  <a href="34.html#5">34:5</a>

<p><li>God's sword is "filled with blood," and he fully intends to use it. He'll kill so many people with it that the "land shall
be soaked with blood."  <a href="34.html#6">34:6-8</a>

<p><li>An angel of God kills 185,000 men. "And when they [those killed by the angel?] arose early in the morning, behold,
they were all dead men."  <a href="37.html#36">37:36</a>

<p><li>No astrologer, stargazer, or prognosticator will be able to save those that God plans to burn to death.
 <a href="47.html#13">47:13-14</a>
 
<p><li>"I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with
    their own blood, as with sweet wine." <a href="49.html#26">49:26</a>
    
<p><li>"The heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a
    garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner." (God plans to destroy the universe.)
    <a href="51.html#6">51:6</a>
    
<p><li>"I will ... trample them in my fury; and their blood ... will stain all my raiment." (God's clothes 
will get stained with the blood of humans.)  <a href="63.html#2-6">63:2-6</a>

<p><li>God will "plead with all flesh" with fire and sword, "and the slain of the Lord shall be many." 
<a href="66.html#16">66:16</a>

<p><li>The carcasses of those killed by God will be piled high. They will rot and burn forever. And although their stench will
be revolting to humans, it will be a sweet savour unto the Lord. <a href="66.html#24">66:24</a>
