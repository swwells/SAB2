  And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that
    were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine
    ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed
    be thou of the LORD, my son.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="3">17:3</A></B>
  And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his
    mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD
    from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now
    therefore I will restore it unto thee.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred
    shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven
    image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim,
    and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah,
    who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="8">17:8</A></B>
  And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where

    Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="10">17:10</A></B>
  And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a
    priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit
    of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
