<p><li>"I make a record in the language of 
my father ... the language of the Egyptians." That's a strange language an Israelite around 
600 BCE to write in!  <a href="1.html#2">1:2</a> 
 
<p><li>Apparently the 400+ km hike from Jerusalem to the Red Sea took only three days. <a href="2.html#5">2:5-6</a>

<p><li>Nephi named a "continually running" river that flowed from Arabia to 
the Red Sea after his son Laman. But there are no permanent rivers in Arabia and there is no evidence that such rivers existed in 600 BCE.
<a href="2.html#8">2:8-9</a>

<p><li>God made the New World just for Nephi and his family. (For though it 
had been occupied by the Native Americans for tens of thousands of years, God made 
it for Nephi, not for them.) <a href="2.html#20">2:20</a>

<p><li>Laban's sword blade was made of steel, long before steel existed.
 <a href="4.html#9">4:9</a>
 
<p><li>"And he, supposing that I spake of the brethren of the church, and that I was truly that Laban whom I had slain, wherefore he 
did follow me."<br>Laban's servant figured Nephi was Laban and that he spoke for the church. 
What church? The Jews in 600 BCE didn't have churches, did they? <a href="4.html#26">4:26</a>

<p><li>Lehi's brass plates told the story of Adam and Eve "who were our first parents." (So Mormons know Evolution is false.) <a href="5.html#11">5:11</a>

<p><li>Nephi sees "many cities" settled by the Nephites in the New World. 
Yet no evidence of them has ever been found. <a href="12.html#3">12:3</a>

<p><li>And then it came to pass that Nephi broke his steel bow. Of course steel didn't exist at the time, wouldn't work 
   well for a bow anyway, and would be hard to break. But, oh well. This is the Book of Mormon. <a href="16.html#18">16:18</a>

<p><li>They come to a place that they call Bountiful, "because of its much fruit and 
also wild honey." But the Arabian coastline does not abound in fruit or honey, and hasn't for 
many thousands of years. <a href="17.html#5">17:5</a>

<p><li>"We did work timbers of curious workmanship." But where did Nephi get the lumber? There are 
 very few trees in the Arabian desert.  <a href="18.html#1">18:1</a>
 
<p><li>After arriving in the New World, Nephi and company planted 
all of the seeds that they brought from "the land of Jerusalem" and "they did grow
exceedingly." Yet there is no evidence that Near Eastern crops ever grew in the New 
World<br> in pre-Columbian times. <a href="18.html#24">18:24</a>

<p><li>Nephi found cows, horses, oxen, asses, and goats and goats when he arrived in the 
New World in 590 BCE. Yet none of these domesticated animals existed in North America 
before the Europeans brought them over 2000 years later. <a href="18.html#25">18:25</a>
