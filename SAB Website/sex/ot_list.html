<p><b><a href="../gen/sex_list.html">Genesis</a></b>

<p><li>"And Adam knew his wife; and she conceived." This is the first sexual intercourse
mentioned in the Bible.&nbsp; <a href="../gen/4.html#1">4:1</a>

<p><li>"And Cain knew his wife." That's nice, but where the hell did she come from? The Bible
doesn't mention any of Cain's sisters. Well, maybe he married his mom. In any case, Cain and
the mysterious Mrs. Cain have a son (another blue cigar!). His name is Enoch and he builds a
city (population 3). <a href="../gen/4.html#17">4:17</a>

<p><li>"And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son." Way to go Adam! 
<a href="../gen/4.html#25">4:25</a>

<p><li><i>"The sons of God came in unto the daughters of men."</i><br>
"The sons of God came in unto the daughters of men" producing "the mighty men of old, men of 
renown." <a href="../gen/6.html#4">6:2, 4</a>

<p><li><i>"Noah ... drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent."</i><br>
The "just and righteous" Noah (<a href="../gen/6.html#9">6:9</a>, <a href="../gen/7.html#1">7:1</a>) plants a vineyard, gets drunk, and lies
around naked in his tent. His son, Ham, happens to see his father in this condition. When Noah
sobers up and hears "what his young son had done unto him" (what did he do besides look at
him?), he curses not Ham, who "saw the nakedness of his father," but Ham's son, Canaan. "A
servant of servants shall he [Canaan] be unto his brethren." <a href="../gen/9.html#20">9:20-25</a>

<p><li>"And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger 
son had done unto him."<br>
What did Ham do? Did he just look at his naked father or was there something more to it than that? 
  Some commentators have suggested that Ham committed homosexual rape on his drunken father, and that 
  this was why Ham's descendants were eternally punished with slavery. <a href="../gen/9.html#24">9:24</a>
  
<p><li>Poor Pharaoh couldn't resist the "very fair" Sarai, and he takes her into 
his harem. <a href="../gen/12.html#15">12:15</a>

<p><li>Sarai is the first of a long line of barren women who were desperate for children. (In
the Bible, it is the women who are barren, never the men.) She sends Abram into her
handmaid, Hagar, so that she can "obtain children by her." Abram gladly complies. 
<a href="../gen/16.html#1">16:1-4</a>

<p><li>God establishes his covenant with Abram: "This is my covenant ... every man child
among you shall be circumcised. And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin." It seems
that penises are supremely important to god. <a href="../gen/17.html#10">17:10-11</a>, <a href="../gen/17.html#23">23-24</a></a>

<p><li>Sarah, who is about 90 years old and has gone through menopause, laughs at God
when he tells her that she will have a son. She asks God if she will "have pleasure" with her
"Lord" [Abraham], when both are so very old. God assures her that he will return and
impregnate her at the appointed time.  <a href="../gen/18.html#11">18:11-14</a>

<p><li>The two angels that visit Lot wash their feet, eat, and are sexually irresistible to Sodomites. <a href="../gen/19.html#1">19:1-5</a>
<p><li>God kills everyone in Sodom and Gomorrah. This was because, so say the
Christian Right, some homosexuals lived there. <a href="../gen/19.html#4">19:4-5</a>, 
<a href="../gen/19.html#24">24-25</a>

<p><li>Lot refuses to give up his angels to the perverted mob, offering his two "virgin daughters"
instead. He tells the bunch of angel rapers to "do unto them [his daughters] as is good in your
eyes." This is the same man that is called "just" and "righteous" in 
<a href="../2pet/2.html#7">2 Pet.2:7-8</a>. <a href="../gen/19.html#8">19:8</a>

<p><li>Lot and his daughters camp out in a cave for a while. The daughters get their "just
and righteous" father drunk, and have sexual intercourse with him, and each conceives and
bears a son (wouldn't you know it!). Just another wholesome family values Bible story. 
<a href="../gen/19.html#30">19:30-38</a>

<p><li>"The Lord visited Sarah" and he "did unto Sarah as he had spoken." And "Sarah
conceived and bare Abraham a son." <a href="../gen/21.html#1">21:1-2</a>

<p><li>&nbsp;Abraham makes his servant put his hand under his thigh while swearing to God.
Weird. Of course "putting his hand under his thigh" is just a polite euphemism for "holding his
testicles in his hand." Come to think of it, maybe it isn't so weird at all -- coming as it does
from a god that is completely obsessed with male genitalia. (See 
<a href="../ex/4.html#25">Ex.4:25</a>, <a href="../lev/15.html#16">Lev.15:16-18</a>, 
<a href="../lev/15.html#32">32</a>, and <a href="../dt/23.html#1">Dt.23:1</a>) for 
just a few examples.) I guess it's sort of like swearing on the bible. 
<a href="../gen/24.html#2">24:2</a>, <a href="../gen/24.html#9">24:9</a>

<p><li>"And the damsel was fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her." (Oh
boy!) <a href="../gen/24.html#16">24:16</a>

<p><li>Unfortunately the king "looked out a window, and saw, behold, Isaac was sporting with
Rebekah his wife." But Isaac grew rich from the lie anyway, just as his father had. 
<a href="../gen/26.html#8">26:8</a>

<p><li>Jacob is tricked by Laban, the father of Rachel and Leah. Jacob asks for Rachel so
that he can "go in unto her." But Laban gives him Leah instead, and Jacob "went in unto her
[Leah]" by mistake. Jacob was fooled until morning -- apparently he didn't know who he was
going in unto. Finally they worked things out and Jacob got to "go in unto" Rachel, too. 
<a href="../gen/29.html#21">29:21-30</a>

<p><li>Jacob goes in unto Leah by mistake.&nbsp; <A href="../gen/29.html#23">29:23</A>, <A href="../gen/29.html#25">25</A></LI>

<p><li>Jacob finally gets to "go in unto" Rachel. He loved Rachel more than Leah. <a href="../gen/29.html#30">29:30</a>

<p><li>"Give me children or else I die." Rachel considers herself worthless if she 
cannot produce children for her husband. But luckily she has an idea. She says to 
Jacob, "Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her." She solved the problem the same way 
as did Sarah (<a href="../gen/16.html#2">16:2</a>). "And Jacob went in unto her. And Bilhah 
conceived, and bare Jacob a son." (These arrangements rarely produce daughters.) 
<a href="../gen/30.html#1">30:1-4</a>

<p><li>Leah, not to be outdone, gives Jacob her maid (Zilpah) "to wife." And Zilpah "bare
Jacob a son." <a href="../gen/30.html#9">30:9</a>

<p><li>Rachel trades her husband's favors for some mandrakes. And so, when Jacob cam
home, Leah said: "Thou must come in unto me, for surely I have hired thee with my son's
mandrakes. And he lay with her that night." Presumably God, by telling us this edifying story, is
teaching us something about sexual ethics. <a href="../gen/30.html#15">30:15-16</a>

<p><li>Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, is "defiled" by a man who seems to love her dearly. Her
brothers trick all of the men of the town and kill them (after first having them all circumcised),
and then take their wives and children captive. <a href="../gen/34.html#1">34:1-31</a>

<p><li>&quot;Reuben went and lay with his father's concubine.&quot;&nbsp; 
<a href="../gen/35.html#22">35:22</a>, <a href="../gen/49.html#4">49:4</a>

<p><li>Judah has casual sex with a Canaanite woman which results in two sons, Er and Onan. 
<a href="../gen/38.html#2">38:2-4</a>

<p><li>After God killed Er, Judah tells Onan to "go in unto thy brother's wife." But "Onan
knew that the seed should not be his; and ... when he went in unto his brother's wife ... he
spilled it on the ground.... And the thing which he did displeased the Lord; wherefore he slew
him also." This lovely Bible story is seldom read in Sunday School, but it is the basis of many
Christian doctrines, including the condemnation of both masturbation and birth control. 
<a href="../gen/38.html#3">38:8-10</a>

<p><li>Tamar (the widow of Er and Onan, who were killed by God) dresses up as a
prostitute and Judah (her father-in-law) propositions her, saying: "Let me come in unto thee ....
And he ... came in unto her, and she conceived by him." From this incestuous union, twins
(<a href="../gen/38.html#27">38:27-28</a>) were born (both were boys of course). One of these was Pharez -- an ancestor of
Jesus (<a href="../lk/3.html#33">Lk.3:33</a>). <a href="../gen/38.html#13">38:13-18</a>
<p><li>After Judah pays Tamar for her services, he is told that she "played the harlot" and "is
with child by whoredom." When Judah hears this, he says, "Bring her forth, and let her be
burnt." <a href="../gen/38.html#24">38:24</a>
<p><li>Joseph is seduced by Potiphar's wife. He rejects her advances, but she claims he
"came in unto" her. <a href="../gen/39.html#7">39:7-18</a>
<p><li>Joseph swears by putting his hand under Jacob's thigh -- a euphemism 
for holding his testicles in his hand. <a href="../gen/47.html#29">47:29</a>
<p><li>God promised to bring Jacob safely back from Egypt (Gen.46:3-4), but God doesn't
keep his promise and Jacob dies in Egypt. <a href="../gen/49.html#29">49:27</a>
<p><li>Jacob says that Reuben will "not excel" because he "went up to [his] father's couch [had
sex with his father's wife]." (see <a href="../gen/35.html#22">Gen.35:22</a>) 
<a href="../gen/49.html#4">49:4</a>

<p><b><a href="../ex/sex_list.html">Exodus</a></b>

<p><li>God decides to kill Moses because his son had not yet been circumcised. Luckily for Moses, his Egyptian wife Zipporah
"took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me. So
he [God] let him go." This story shows the importance of penises to God, and his hatred of foreskins.  <a href="../ex/4.html#24">4:24</a>
<p><li>Moses, like a coach giving instructions to the team before the big game, tells the men to "come not at your wives" before
he goes up to Mt. Sinai.  <a href="../ex/19.html#15">19:15</a>
<p><li>God tells the priests not to go up the steps to the altar "that thy nakedness not be discovered thereon." (Skirts on stairs are
a problem.) <a href="../ex/20.html#26">20:26</a>
<p><li>"Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death." Is it really necessary to kill such people? Couldn't we just
send them to counseling or something?  <a href="../ex/22.html#19">22:19</a>
<p><li>Aaron makes a golden calf and tells the people to take off their clothes and dance around naked. God then punishes them
mercilessly for following their divinely appointed religious leader.  <a href="../ex/32.html#1">32:1-35</a>
<p><li>Aaron makes the people take off all their clothes and dance naked around his golden calf. 
<a href="../ex/32.html#25">32:25</a>
<p><li>"Their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods." God always blames the
women; it is they who "go a whoring" and then "make" the men "go a whoring."  <a href="../ex/34.html#16">34:16</a>

<p><b><a href="../lev/sex_list.html">Leviticus</a></b>

<p><li><p><li>"Or if he touch the uncleanness of man ... he shall be guilty."<br>
If you touch "the uncleanness of man" (?!) you'll be guilty. <a href="../lev/5.html#3">5:3</a>
 
<p><li>Long, tiresome, and disgusting instructions regarding the treatment of men who have a
"running issue" out of their "flesh." Very enlightening. "And if he that hath the issue spit upon him
that is clean..."  <a href="../lev/15.html#1">15:1-15</a>

<p><li>"Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean: and every thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean." <a href="../lev/15.html#4">

<p><li>"And whosoever toucheth his bed shall ... be unclean until the even." <a href="../lev/15.html#5">15:5</a>

<p><li>"And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat ... shall ... be unclean until the even." <a href="../lev/15.html#6">15:6</a>

<p><li>"And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall ... be unclean until the even." <a href="../lev/15.html#7">15:7</a>

<p><li> "And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean; then he shall ... be unclean until the even." <a href="../lev/15.html#8">15:8</a>

<p><li>"And what saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the issue shall be unclean." <a href="../lev/15.html#9">15:9</a>

<p><li>"And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be unclean until the even." <a href="../lev/15.html#10">15:10</a>

<p><li> "And whomsoever he toucheth ... shall ... be unclean until the even." <a href="../lev/15.html#11">15:11</a>

<p><li>"And the vessel of earth, that he toucheth ... shall be broken: and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water." 
<a href="../lev/15.html#12">15:12</a>

<p><li>"He that hath an issue ... shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing ... and shall be clean." <a href="../lev/15.html#13">15:13</a>

<p><li>"If any man's seed of copulation go out from him...." (God's law for wet dreams)<br>
This passage tells you what to do if you get your "seed of copulation" on yourself,
your clothes, or your partner. Thank God this is in the Bible.  
<a href="../lev/15.html#16">15:16-18</a>, <a href="../lev/15.html#32">32</a>

<p><li>"If any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he shall ... be unclean until the even." <a href="../lev/15.html#16">15:16</a>

<p><li>"And every garment ... whereon is the seed of copulation, shall be ... unclean until the even."  <a href="../lev/15.html#17">15:17</a>

<p><li>"The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water, 
and be unclean until the even." <a href="../lev/15.html#18">15:18</a>

<p><li>"This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed goeth from him ... And of her that is sick of her flowers, 
and of him that hath an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean." 
<a href="../lev/15.html#32">15:32-33</a>

<p><li>Don't "uncover the nakedness" of any of your relatives or neighbors. Just ask them
to keep their clothes on while you are around.  <a href="../lev/18.html#6">18:6-18, 20</a>

<p><li>"Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is
apart for her uncleanness," Don't even look at a menstruating woman. 
 <a href="../lev/18.html#19">18:19</a>
 
 <p><li>Don't "lie with any beast." You probably weren't planning on doing this, but now 
you know just in case you get the urge sometime.  <a href="../lev/18.html#23">18:23</a>

<p><li>Don't "go a whoring" after Molech or "commit adultery with him." (Don't you love it
when God talks dirty?)  <a href="../lev/20.html#5">20:5</a>

<p><li>Stay away from people with familiar spirits and don't "go a whoring"

lifting her skirt over her head, so to speak. He's seen her commit whoredoms and abominations and 
whatnot on the hills, and he's getting darned sick of it! <a href="../jer/13.html#26">13:26-27</a>

<p><b><a href="../lam/sex_list.html">Lamentations</a></b>

<p><li> Jerusalem is compared to a naked woman who sighs and turns backward. &quot;Her filthiness is 
in her skirts.&quot; <a href="../lam/1.html#8">1:8-9</a>
<p><li> The adversary puts his hand upon &quot;all her pleasant things. <a href="../lam/1.html#10">1:10</a>
<p><li> When God gets angry at you he calls you a drunken whore.  <a href="../lam/4.html#21">4:21</a>


<p><b><a href="../ezek/sex_list.html">Ezekiel</a></b>


<p><li>Seeing that it is the time for love, God spreads his skirt over Jerusalem to cover her 
nakedness. <a href="../ezek/6.html#8">6:8</a>

<p><li>God dresses up Jerusalem, 
cleans off the blood that  she was wallowing in, and compliments her on her nice hair 
and breasts.  <a href="../ezek/16.html#6">16:6-7, 22</a>

<p><li>Jerusalem was a harlot who had sex with everyone that passed by. <a href="../ezek/16.html#15">16:15-16</a>

<p><li>"Thou hast ... madest to thyself images of men, and didst commit whoredom with 
them." <a href="../ezek/16.html#17">16:17</a>

<p><li>"Thou ... hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by." <a href="../ezek/16.html#25">16:25</a>

<p><li>"Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, great of flesh." (Jerusalem 
had sex with Egyptians with big penises.) <a href="../ezek/16.html#26">16:26</a>

<p><li>Jerusalem still wasn't satisfied after having sex with the the well-endowed Egyptians 
(<a href="#26">v.26</a>), so she had sex with the Assyrians too. Yet she still wasn't satisfied. 
So she had sex with the men of Canaan and Chaldea, but still was not satisfied. 
<a href="../ezek/16.html#28">16:28-29</a>

<p><li>God calls Jerusalem "an imperious whorish woman." <a href="../ezek/16.html#30">16:30</a>

<p><li>God says that Jerusalem has sex with strangers, hiring them to "come in unto thee on every side."
<a href="../ezek/16.html#32">16:32-33</a>

<p><li>Because she is such a filthy harlot, God will expose her nakedness 
before all of her lovers. <a href="../ezek/16.html#35">16:35-36</a>

<p><li>After exposing her nakedness, God will give her "blood in fury and jealousy" and strip her naked once 
more. <a href="../ezek/16.html#38">16:38-41</a>

<p><li>Information from God about discovering the nakedness 
    of fathers, committing adultery with neighbor's wives, sex with menstruating women, 
daughters-in-law, sisters, etc.  <a href="../ezek/22.html#1">22:1-11</a>

<p><li> Two sisters were guilty of &quot;committing whoredoms&quot; by pressing their breasts and 
bruising &quot;the teats of their virginity.&quot; As a punishment, one sister's nakedness was 
discovered, her children were taken from her, and she was killed by the sword. And the fate of the 
surviving sister was even worse: Her nose and ears were cut off, she was made to &quot;pluck off&quot; 
her own breasts, and then after being raped and mutilated, she is stoned to death. 
<a href="../ezek/23.html#1">23:1-49</a>

<p><li>"Their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity." <a href="../ezek/23.html#3">23:3</a>

<p><li>"Thus she committed her whoredoms with them ...  with all their idols she defiled herself." <a href="../ezek/23.html#7">23:7</a>

<p><li>"They bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her." <a href="../ezek/23.html#8">23:8</a>

<p><li>"These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword." <a href="../ezek/23.html#10">23:10</a>

<p><li>"Her sister ... was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and
    in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms." <a href="../ezek/23.html#11">23:11</a>
    
<p><li>"And the Babylonians came
    to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom,
    and she was polluted with them." <a href="../ezek/23.html#17">23:17</a> 
    
<p><li>"So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness ... she multiplied her whoredoms." <a href="../ezek/23.html#18">23:18-19</a>
    
<p><li>Really Big Penises. One of the sister (Aholibah) had lovers
&quot;whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.&quot;
<a href="../ezek/23.html#20">23:20</a>

<p><li>"The lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth." <a href="../ezek/23.html#21">23:21</a>

<p><li>"They shall also strip
    thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels." <a href="../ezek/23.html#26">23:26</a>
    
    <p><li>"Thou shalt ... pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD." <a href="../ezek/23.html#34">23:34</a>
    
    <p><li>"They went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot." <a href="../ezek/23.html#44">23:44</a>
    
    <p><LI>"And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; 
    because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands." <a href="../ezek/23.html#45">23:45</a>
    
<p><li> God makes &quot;all their loins to be at a stand&quot; and then cuts them
    off.  <a href="../ezek/29.html#7">29:7-9</a>
