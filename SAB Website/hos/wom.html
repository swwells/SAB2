<p><li>God tells Hosea to commit adultery, saying "take ... a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms" because the land has "committed great
whoredom." So Hosea did as God commanded and "took" a wife named Gomer.  <a href="1.html#2">1:2-3</a>
  
<p><li> God (or Hosea?) tells his children that their mother is a whore who is not his wife. He asks 
them to tell their mother to "put away her whoredoms" and  "her adulteries from between her breasts" or 
he'll "strip her naked ... and slay her with thirst." <a href="2.html#2">2:2-3</a>

<p><li>God "will not have mercy upon ... the children of whoredoms. For their mother hath played the
harlot."  <a href="2.html#4">2:4-5</a>

<p><li> God says he "will discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers."  <a href="2.html#10">2:10</a>
  
<p><li>"She decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD." <a href="2.html#13">2:13</a>

<p><li>God tells Hosea to love an adulteress. (I thought he already did that in chapter 1.) In any case, Hosea buys (another?) one 
for a homer and a half of barley.  <a href="3.html#1">3:1-2</a>

<p><li>Committing whoredom by going a whoring with the spirit of whoredom. <a href="4.html#10">4:10</a>

<p><li>If you misbehave, God will make your daughters "commit whoredom" and your wife "commit 
adultery." </a> <a href="4.html#13">4:13</a>

<p><li> If you misbehave, God will make your daughters &quot;commit whoredom&quot; and your 
wife &quot;commit adultery.&quot;  </a><a href="4.html#13">4:13</a>

<p><li>"O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom." <a href="5.html#3">5:3</a>

<p><li>"The spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them." <a href="5.html#4">5:4</a>

<p><li> Israel has &quot;gone a whoring&quot; and has &quot;loved a reward upon every cornfloor.&quot; <a href="9.html#1">9:1</a>
<p><li> God will induce miscarriages and kill the children of Ephraim. <a href="9.html#11">9:11-12</a>
<p><li>"O Lord: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.&quot;
  <a href="9.html#14">9:14</a>
<p><li> "I will slay even the beloved fruit of their womb.&quot; <a href="9.html#16">9:16</a>
<p><li>God will punish Israel by "dashing" together mothers and their children.
 <a href="10.html#14">10:14</a>
<p><li>Because the Samaritans chose to worship another deity, God will dash their infants to pieces and 
their &quot;women with child shall be ripped up.&quot;&nbsp;<a href="13.html#16">13:16</a>
