"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",

"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.   Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</span>--<a href='30.html#22'>Alma 30:22</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",

"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",

address you in my language; yea, by my own mouth, seeing that it is the first time that I have spoken unto you by the
 words of my mouth, I having been wholly confined to the judgment-seat, having had much business that I could not
  come unto you. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  
<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>7:2</b>   And even I could not have come now at this time were it not that the judgment-seat hath been given to 
another, to reign in my stead; and the Lord in much mercy hath granted that I should come unto you. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>7:3</b>   And behold, I have come having great hopes and much desire that I should find that ye had humbled 
yourselves before God, and that ye had continued in the supplicating of his grace, that I should find that ye were 
blameless before him, that I should find that ye were not in the awful dilemma that our brethren were in at 
Zarahemla. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>7:4</b>   But blessed be the name of God, that he hath given me to know, yea, hath given unto me 
the <span class="a">exceedingly</span> great joy of knowing that they are established again in the way of his 
righteousness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>7:5</b>   And I trust, according to the Spirit of God which is in me, that I shall also have joy over you; 
nevertheless I do not desire that my joy over you should come by the cause of so much afflictions and sorrow which 
I have had for the brethren at Zarahemla, for behold, my joy cometh over them after wading through much affliction and 
sorrow. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>7:6</b>   But behold, <span class="i">I trust that ye are not in a state of so much unbelief</span> as were your brethren; I trust that 
ye are not lifted up in the pride of your hearts; yea, I trust that ye have not set your hearts upon riches and the vain 
things of the world; yea, I trust that you do not worship idols, but that ye do worship the true and living God, 
and that ye look forward for the remission of your sins, with an everlasting faith, which is to come. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>7:7</b>   For behold, I say unto you there be many things to come; and behold, there is one thing which is of more 
importance than they all -- for behold, the time is not far distant that the Redeemer liveth and cometh among his 
people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>7:8</b>   Behold, I do not say that he will come among us at the time of his dwelling in his mortal tabernacle; 
for behold, the Spirit hath not said unto me that this should be the case.  Now as to this thing I do not know; but this
 much I do know, that the Lord God hath power to do all things which are according to his word. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>7:9</b>   But behold, the Spirit hath said this much unto me, saying: Cry unto this people, 
 saying -- <span class="plag">Repent ye</span>, 
 and prepare the way of the Lord, and walk in his paths, which are straight; for behold, <span class="plag">the kingdom of 
 heaven is at hand</span>, and the Son of God cometh upon the face of the earth. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

 know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

 that he might take upon him the sins of his people, that he might blot out their transgressions according to the 
 power of his deliverance; and now behold, this is the testimony which is in me. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>7:14</b>   Now I say unto you that ye must repent, and be born again; for the Spirit saith 
 <span class="plag">if ye are not born  again ye cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven</span>; therefore come and be baptized unto repentance, that ye may be washed

 save and <span class="plag">to cleanse from all unrighteousness. </span><td bgcolor="eeeeee" >
