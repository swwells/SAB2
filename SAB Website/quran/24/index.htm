And when the children among you come to puberty then let them ask leave  even as those before them used to ask it. Thus Allah maketh clear His revelations for  you. Allah is Knower, Wise. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

As for women past child-bearing, who have no hope of marriage, it is no sin  for them if they discard their (outer) clothing in such a way as not to show adornment.  But to refrain is better for them. Allah is Hearer, Knower. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

No blame is there upon the blind nor any blame upon the lame nor any blame  upon the sick nor on yourselves if ye eat from your houses, or the houses of your  fathers, or the houses of your mothers, or the houses of your brothers, or the houses of  your sisters, or the houses of your fathers' brothers, or the houses of your fathers'  sisters, or the houses of your mothers' brothers, or the houses of your mothers' sisters,  or (from that) whereof ye hold the keys, or (from the house) of a friend. No sin shall it  be for you whether ye eat together or apart. But when ye enter houses, salute one  another with a greeting from Allah, blessed and sweet. Thus Allah maketh clear His  revelations for you, that haply ye may understand. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<span class="i">They only are the true believers who believe in Allah and His messenger</span>  and, when they are with 
him on some common errand, go not away until they have  asked leave of him. Lo! those who ask leave of thee, 
those are they who believe in  Allah and His messenger. So, if they ask thy leave for some affair of theirs, give 
leave  to whom thou wilt of them, and ask for them forgiveness of Allah. Lo! Allah is  Forgiving, 
Merciful. <td bgcolor="eeeeee" valign="top">

Make not the calling of the messenger among you as your calling one of  another. Allah knoweth those of you who steal away, hiding themselves. And let  those who conspire to evade orders beware lest grief or painful punishment befall  them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Lo! verily unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth.  He knoweth your condition. And 
(He knoweth) the Day when they are returned unto  Him so that He may inform them of what they did. Allah is Knower 
of all things. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
