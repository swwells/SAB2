if a man should lay his tool or his sword upon his shelf, or upon the place whither he would keep it, behold, upon the 
morrow, he could not find it, so great was the curse upon the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>14:2</b>   Wherefore every man did cleave unto that which was his own, with his hands, and would not borrow neither 
would he lend; and every man kept the hilt of his sword in his right hand, in the defence of his property and his own 
life and of his wives and children. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>14:3</b>   And now, after the space of two years, and after the death of Shared, behold, there arose the 
brother of Shared and he gave battle unto Coriantumr, in which Coriantumr did beat him and did pursue him to the 
wilderness of Akish. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

before them, all them that would not join them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>14:28</b>   And they pitched their tents in the valley of Corihor; and Coriantumr pitched his tents in the

together upon the hill Comnor, and did sound a trumpet unto the armies of Shiz to invite them forth to battle. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

	<span class="a">exceedingly sore</span>. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>14:30</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Shiz smote upon Coriantumr that he gave him many deep wounds; and Coriantumr,

<tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>14:31</b>   Now the loss of men, women and children on both sides was so great that Shiz commanded his people that 
they should not pursue the armies of Coriantumr; wherefore, they returned to their camp. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
