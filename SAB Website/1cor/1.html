 listen to criticism of the Watchtower Society's teachings, and to fight against independent thinking.

    Christians started out divided (into followers of Paul, Apollos, Cephas, or Christ), and it has remained so ever since.
    
    <p><img src="../images/abs1.gif" > (1:14-16) Poor Paul is confused. First he says that
he baptized no one. Well, except for Crispus and Gaius. And maybe Stephanus and

  For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but

  For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:

  But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto
    the Greeks foolishness;

  Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God
