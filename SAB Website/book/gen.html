    God curses the serpent. From now on he will crawl on his belly and eat dust.<br>

    <i>"He shall rule over thee."</i><br> God punishes Eve, and all 
    women after her, with a multitude of sorrows, the pains of childbirth, and subjection to men.  <br>

 <i>"Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife"</i><br>
  Adam is also punished, although less severely. He now will have to work for a living because he 
    "hearkened unto the voice" of his wife.  <br>

  But God is not done cursing yet. He curses
the ground and causes thorns and thistles to grow. Before this, according to the (false) Genesis story, plants had no 
natural defenses. The rose had no thorn, cacti were spineless, and nettles had no sting. 
Foxgloves, oleander, and milkweeds were perfectly safe to eat.

    (3:22-24) <i>"The man is become as one of us ... and now, lest he ... live for ever...."</i><br>
    God expels Adam and Eve from the garden before
they get a chance to eat from that other tree -- the tree of life. God knows
that if they do that, they will become "like one of us" and live
forever. A spooky thought indeed for an insecure god. Notice that God refers to
himself (themselves?) in the first person plural, suggesting, contrary to many
other Bible verses, that there are several gods.<br>
<!--<p style="margin-left: 10">Although God told Adam not to eat from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil (2:16-17), he 
never told him not to eat from the Tree of Life. God said that Adam would die the day that he ate 
from the forbidden tree (2:17). Well, Adam ate from that tree (3:6), so why was God worried that 
Adam might eat from that other tree (the Tree of Life) and live forever?-->
(3:22) 5-How many gods are there?</br>
(3:22) 8-When did Adam die?
