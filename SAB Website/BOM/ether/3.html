The brother of Jared made 16 small stones, as clear as glass, out of molten rock. He then 
asked God to touch the stones to make them into lights to light up the inside of the barges. God 
did as the brother of Jared requested.

<i>"These stones shall magnify to the eyes of men these things which ye shall write."</i><br>
God gives the brother of Jared two magic stones that will "magnify the eyes of men" so that they can read what Jared 
writes.

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>3:24</b>   For behold, the language which ye shall write I have confounded; wherefore I will cause in my own due 
time that <span class="a">these stones shall magnify to the eyes of men these things which ye shall write.

<i>"He showed unto the brother of Jared all the inhabitants of the earth."</i><br>
Jesus shows the brother of Jared every human that has lived or ever will live.

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>3:26</b>   For he had said unto him in times before, that if he would believe in him that he could show unto him 
all things -- it should be shown unto him; therefore the Lord could not withhold anything from him, for he knew that the 
Lord could show him all things. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>3:27</b>   And the Lord said unto him: Write these things and seal them up; and I will show them in mine own due time 
unto the children of men. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

received, and show them not, until the Lord should show them unto the children of men. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
