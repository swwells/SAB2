"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",
"<span class='i'>Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever.</span>--<a href='3.html#14'>Alma 3:14</a>",
"<span class='i'>I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</span>--<a href='3.html#15'>Alma 3:15</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",
"<span class='a'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges ... even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year....</span>--<a href='16.html#1'>Alma 16:1</a>",
"<span class='a'>Their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.</span>--<a href='16.html#11'>Alma 16:11</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.   Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</span>--<a href='30.html#22'>Alma 30:22</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",
"<span class='i'>God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.</span>--<a href='30.html#47'>Alma 30:47</a>",
"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Amalekites were of a more wicked and murderous disposition than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='43.html#6'>Alma 43:6</a>",

"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",
"<span class='i'>These dissenters ... became ... more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='47.html#36'>Alma 47:36</a>",
"<span class='a'>God would prosper them in the land, or in other words ... God ... would prosper them in the land.</span>--<a href='48.html#15'>Alma 48:15</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='50.html#22'>Alma 50:22</a>",
"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",
"<span class='i'>The remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty.</span>--<a href='51.html#20'>Alma 51:20</a>",
"<span class='g'>And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye.</span>--<a href='54.html#21'>Alma 54:21</a>",

(14:1, 4, 6, 7, 9, 14, 17, 19, 20, 23, 25, 27)
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>14:2</b>   But the more part of them were desirous that they might destroy Alma and Amulek; for 
they were angry with Alma, because of the plainness of his words unto Zeezrom; and they also said that Amulek had 
lied unto them, and had reviled against their law and also against their lawyers and judges. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>143:</b>   And they were also angry with Alma and Amulek; and because they had testified so plainly 
against their wickedness, they sought to put them away privily. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>14:4</b>   <span class="a">But it came to pass</span> that they did not; but they took them and bound them with strong cords, 
and took them before the chief judge of the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>14:5</b>   And the people went forth and witnessed against them -- testifying that they had reviled 
against the law, and their lawyers and judges of the land, and also of all the people that were in the land; and also 
testified that there was but one God, and that he should send his Son among the people, but he should not save them; 
and many such things did the people testify against Alma and Amulek.  Now this was done before the chief judge of the 
land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>14:6</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Zeezrom was astonished at the words which 
had been spoken; and he also knew concerning the blindness of the minds, which he had caused among the people by his 
lying words; and his soul began to be harrowed up under a consciousness of his own guilt; yea, he began to be 
encircled about by the pains of hell. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>14:7</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that he began to cry unto the people, saying: 
Behold, I am guilty, and these men are spotless before God.  And he began to plead for them from that time forth; 
but they reviled him, saying: Art thou also possessed with the devil? And they spit upon him, and cast him out from among them, and also all those who believed in the words which had 
been spoken by Alma and Amulek; and they cast them out, and sent men to cast stones at them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>14:8</b>   And <span class="v">they brought their wives and children together, and</span> whosoever believed or had been 
taught to believe in the word of God <span class="v">they caused that they should be cast into the fire</span>, and they also brought forth 
their records which contained the holy scriptures, and cast them into the fire also, that they might be burned and 
destroyed by fire. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/fv.gif" width="32" height="32"> (14:8-13) <i>"The Spirit constraineth me."</i><br>
Alma refuses to ask God to prevent the burning to death of women and children. It is "the will of the Lord."
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>14:9</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they took Alma and Amulek, and carried 
them forth to the place of martyrdom, that they might witness the destruction of those who were consumed by fire. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>14:10</b>   <span class="v">And when Amulek saw the pains of the women and children who were consuming in the fire, 
he also was pained; and he said unto Alma: How can we witness this awful scene?</span>  Therefore let us stretch forth our 
hands, and exercise the power of God which is in us, and save them from the flames. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>14:11</b>   <span class="v">But Alma said unto him: The Spirit constraineth me that I must not stretch forth mine hand;</span> 
for behold the Lord receiveth them up unto himself, in glory; and he doth suffer that they may do this thing, or that 
the people may do this thing unto them, according to the hardness of their hearts, that the judgments which he shall 
exercise upon them in his wrath may be just; and the blood of the innocent shall stand as a witness against them, 
yea, and cry mightily against them at the last day. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>14:12</b>   Now Amulek said unto Alma: Behold, perhaps they will burn us also. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>14:13</b>   And Alma said: <span class="v">Be it according to the will of the Lord</span>.  But, behold, our work is not 
finished; therefore they burn us not. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>14:14</b>   <span class="a">Now it came to pass</span> that when the bodies of those who had been cast into the fire were 
consumed, and also the records which were cast in with them, the chief judge of the land came and stood before Alma 
and Amulek, as they were bound; and he smote them with his hand upon their cheeks, and said unto them: After what 
ye have seen, will ye preach again unto this people, that they shall be cast into a lake of fire and brimstone? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>14:15</b>   Behold, ye see that ye had not power to save those who had been cast into the fire; 
neither has God saved them because they were of thy faith.  And the judge smote them again upon their cheeks, and 
asked: What say ye for yourselves? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>14:16</b>   Now this judge was after the order and faith of Nehor, who slew Gideon. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>14:17</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Alma and Amulek answered him nothing; 
and he smote them again, and delivered them to the officers to be cast into prison. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>14:18</b>   And when they had been cast into prison three days, there came many lawyers, and judges, 
and priests, and teachers, who were of the profession of Nehor; and they came in unto the prison to see them, and 
they questioned them about many words; but they answered them nothing. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>14:19</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the judge stood before them, and said: 
0Why do ye not answer the words of this people?  Know ye not that I have power to deliver you up unto the flames?  
And he commanded them to speak; but they answered nothing. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>14:20</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they departed and went their ways, but 
came again on the morrow; and the judge also smote them again on their cheeks.  And many came forth also, and smote 
them, saying: Will ye stand again and judge this people, and condemn our law?  If ye have such great power why do ye 
not deliver yourselves? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>14:21</b>   And many such things did they say unto them, gnashing their teeth upon them, and spitting
 upon them, and saying: How shall we look when we are damned? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>14:22</b>   And many such things, yea, all manner of such things did they say unto them; and thus 
 they did mock them for many days.  And they did withhold food from them that they might hunger, and water that 
 they might thirst; and they also did take from them their clothes that they were naked; and thus they were bound 
 with strong cords, and confined in prison. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>14:23</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> after they had thus suffered for many 
 days, (and it was on the twelfth day, in the tenth month, in the tenth year of the reign of the judges over the 
 people of Nephi) that the chief judge over the land of Ammonihah and many of their teachers and their lawyers went 
 in unto the prison where Alma and Amulek were bound with cords. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>14:24</b>   And the chief judge stood before them, and smote them again, and said unto them: 
 If ye have the power of God deliver yourselves from these bands, and then we will believe that the Lord will destroy 
 this people according to your words. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>14:25</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they all went forth and smote them, 
 saying the same words, even until the last; and when the last had spoken unto them the power of God was upon Alma 
 and Amulek, and they rose and stood upon their feet. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
  <tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>14:26</b>   And Alma cried, saying: How long shall we suffer these great afflictions, O Lord?  
 O Lord, give us strength according to our faith which is in Christ, even unto deliverance.  And they broke the 
 cords with which they were bound; and when the people saw this, they began to flee, for the fear of destruction 
 had come upon them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>14:27</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that so great was their fear that they fell 
 to the earth, and did not obtain the outer door of the prison; and the earth shook mightily, and the walls of the 
 prison were rent in twain, so that they fell to the earth; and the chief judge, and the lawyers, and priests, and 
 teachers, who smote upon Alma and Amulek, were slain by the fall thereof. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>14:28</b>   And Alma and Amulek came forth out of the prison, and they were not hurt; for the Lord 
 had granted unto them power, according to their faith which was in Christ.  And they straightway came forth out of 
 the prison; and they were loosed from their bands; and the prison had fallen to the earth, and every soul within 
 the walls thereof, save it were Alma and Amulek, was slain; and they straightway came forth into the city. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>14:29</b>   Now the people having heard a great noise came running together by multitudes to know the 
 cause of it; and when they saw Alma and Amulek coming forth out of the prison, and the walls thereof had fallen to the 
 earth, they were struck with great fear, and fled from the presence of Alma and Amulek even as a goat fleeth with her 
 young from two lions; and thus they did flee from the presence of Alma and Amulek. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
