<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (17:6, 19) <a href="exceed_list.html">Exceedingly</a>

<p>In the last chapter, God gave Nephi a magic ball that pointed in the direction that God wanted him to go and even told Nephi 
where to kill wild beasts. All this happened within in single year: 600 BCE.

<p>Now it was time for some serious traveling.

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (17:1a) They began by heading east into the wilderness, across the Arabian peninsula.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that we did again take our journey in the wilderness; and we did travel nearly eastward from that time forth."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif">
<img src="../../images/wom1.gif"> (17:1b) They waded through much affliction and their nameless women bore children in the wilderness.

<p><i>"And we did travel and wade through much affliction in the wilderness; and our women did bear children in the wilderness."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (17:2-4) God fed them raw meat, their women gave plenty of suck, and the children grew up quickly, becoming as strong as men 
during the eight year journey.

<p><i>"While we did live upon raw meat in the wilderness, our women did 
give plenty of suck for their children, and were strong, yea, even like unto the men; and they began to bear their journeyings without 
murmurings. ... And we did sojourn for the space of many years, yea, even eight years in the wilderness."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif">
<img src="../../images/sci1.gif"> (17:5) After eight years of wading through affliction, eating raw meat, and getting plenty of suck, they arrived at a land they 
called Bountiful (because of its much fruit and also wild honey). And they saw the sea which they called Irreantum, which, being 
interpreted, means nothing at all. (The Arabian coastline doesn't abound in fruit or honey, and hasn't for many thousands of years.)

<p><i>"And we did come to the land which we called Bountiful, because of its much fruit and also wild honey; and all these things 
were prepared of the Lord that we might not perish. And we beheld the sea, which we called Irreantum, which, being interpreted, is 
many waters."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (17:7-47)

<p>(17:7) Then it came to pass after a space of many days that he, Nephi, heard the voice of the Lord, saying, "Arise, get thee into 
the mountain." So Nephi got into the mountain and cried unto the Lord.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had been in the land of Bountiful for the space of many days, the voice of the Lord 
came unto me, saying: Arise, and get thee into the mountain. And it came to pass that I arose and went up into the mountain, and 
cried unto the Lord."</i>

<p>(17:8) While Nephi was crying on the mountain top, God told him to build a ship.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, saying: Thou shalt construct a ship, after the manner which I shall show 
thee, that I may carry thy people across these waters."</i>

<p>(17:9) Nephi asked God where he would find the ore to make the metal to make the tools to make the ship.

<p><i>"And I said: Lord, whither shall I go that I may find ore to molten, that I may make tools to construct the ship after 
the manner which thou hast shown unto me?"</i>

<p>(17:10) But it was no big deal. God showed Nephi where to find the ore to make the tools.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that the Lord told me whither I should go to find ore, that I might make tools."</i>

<p>(17:11) Nephi made a bellows from the skin of beasts so he could blow on a fire, which he made by striking two stones together.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did make a bellows wherewith to blow the fire, of the skins of beasts; and after I had 
made a bellows, that I might have wherewith to blow the fire, I did smite two stones together that I might make fire."</i>

<p>(17:12) Up to this time, you see, Nephi et al had no fire as they journeyed through the wilderness. 
They ate raw meat, which God sweetened for them.

<p><i>"For the Lord had not hitherto suffered that we should make much fire, as we journeyed in the wilderness; for he said: 
I will make thy food become sweet, that ye cook it not."</i>

<p>(17:16) So Nephi was pretty much all set. God showed Nephi where to mine the ore, from which he made ship-building tools 
using his trusty beast-skin bellows and striking stones.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that I did make tools of the ore which I did molten out of the rock."</i>

<p>(17:17) But when Nephi's brothers saw what he was doing they began to murmur against him.

<p><i>"And when my brethren saw that I was about to build a ship, they began to murmur against me, saying: Our brother is a fool, 
for he thinketh that he can build a ship; yea, and he also thinketh that he can cross these great waters."</i>

<p>(17:19-47) <br>
Whereupon Nephi began a long, boring 1000-word sermon.

<tr><td><b><a name="9">17:9</b></a>   <span class="a">And I said: Lord, whither shall I go that I may find ore to molten, 
that I may make tools to construct the ship after the manner which thou hast shown unto 
me? </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="10">17:10</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that the Lord told me 
whither I should go to find ore, that I might make tools. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="11">17:11</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did make a 
bellows wherewith to blow the fire, of the skins of beasts; and after I had made a 
bellows, that I might have wherewith to blow the fire, I did smite two stones together 
that I might make fire. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="12">17:12</b></a>   <span class="a">For the Lord had not hitherto suffered 
that we should make much fire, as we journeyed in the wilderness; for he said: I will make 
thy food become sweet, that ye cook it not</span>; 

<tr><td><b><a name="13">17:13</b></a>   And I will also be your light in the wilderness; and I will prepare 
the way before you, if it so be that ye shall keep my commandments; wherefore, inasmuch 
as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall be led towards the promised land; and ye shall 
know that it is by me that ye are led. 

<tr><td><b><a name="14">17:14</b></a>   Yea, and the Lord said 
also that: After ye have arrived in the promised land, ye shall know that I, the Lord, am 
God; and that I, the Lord, did deliver you from destruction; yea, that I did bring you out 
of the land of Jerusalem. 

<tr><td><b><a name="15">17:15</b></a>   Wherefore, I, Nephi, did strive to keep the commandments of the 
Lord, and I did exhort my brethren to faithfulness and diligence. 

<tr><td><b><a name="16">17:16</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that I did make tools of 
the ore which I did molten out of the rock. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="17">17:17</b></a>   <span class="a">And when my brethren saw that I was about to build a ship, they began 
to murmur against me, saying: Our brother is a fool, for he thinketh that he can build a 
ship; yea, and he also thinketh that he can cross these great waters. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="18">17:18</b></a>   And thus my brethren did complain against me, and were desirous that 
they might not labor, for they did not believe that I could build a ship; neither would 
they believe that I was instructed of the Lord. 

<tr><td><b><a name="19">17:19</b></a>   And now <span class="a">it came to pass</span> that I, Nephi, was 
<span class="a">exceedingly</span> sorrowful because of the hardness of their hearts; and 
now when they saw that I began to be sorrowful they were glad in their hearts, insomuch 
that they did rejoice over me, saying: We knew that ye could not construct a ship, for we 
knew that ye were lacking in judgment; wherefore, thou canst not accomplish so great a 
work. 

<tr><td><b><a name="20">17:20</b></a>   And thou art like unto our father, led away by the foolish 
imaginations of his heart; yea, he hath led us out of the land of Jerusalem, and we have 
wandered in the wilderness for these many years; and our women have toiled, being big with 
child; and they have borne children in the wilderness and suffered all things, save it were 
death; and it would have been better that they had died before they came out of Jerusalem 
than to have suffered these afflictions. 

<tr><td><b><a name="21">17:21</b></a>   Behold, these many years we have suffered in the wilderness, which 
time we might have enjoyed our possessions and the land of our inheritance; yea, and we 
might have been happy. 

<tr><td><b><a name="22">17:22</b></a>   And we know that the people who were in the land of Jerusalem were a 
righteous people; for they kept the statutes and judgments of the Lord, and all his 
commandments, according to the law of Moses; wherefore, we know that they are a righteous 
people; and our father hath judged them, and hath led us away because we would hearken unto 
his words; yea, and our brother is like unto him.  And after this manner of language did my 
brethren murmur and complain against us. 

<tr><td><b><a name="23">17:23</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that I, Nephi, spake unto 
them, saying: Do ye believe that our fathers, who were the children of Israel, would have 
been led away out of the hands of the Egyptians if they had not hearkened unto the words of 
the Lord? 

<tr><td><b><a name="24">17:24</b></a>   Yea, do ye suppose that they would have been led out of bondage, if 
the Lord had not commanded Moses that he should lead them out of bondage? 

<tr><td><b><a name="25">17:25</b></a>   Now ye know that the children of Israel were in bondage; and ye know 
that they were laden with tasks, which were grievous to be borne; wherefore, ye know that 
it must needs be a good thing for them, that they should be brought out of bondage. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26">17:26</b></a>   Now ye know that Moses was commanded of the Lord to do that great 
work; and ye know that by his word the waters of the Red Sea were divided hither and 
thither, and they passed through on dry ground. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27">17:27</b></a>   But ye know that the Egyptians were drowned in the Red Sea, who were 
the armies of Pharaoh. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

wilderness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

of God which was in him, smote the rock, and there came forth water, that the children of 
Israel might quench their thirst. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="30">17:30</b></a>   And notwithstanding they being led, the Lord their God, their 
Redeemer, going before them, leading them by day and giving light unto them by night, and 
doing all things for them which were expedient for man to receive, they hardened their 
hearts and blinded their minds, and reviled against Moses and against the true and living 
God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="31">17:31</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that according to his word 
he did destroy them; and according to his word he did lead them; and according to his word 
he did do all things for them; and there was not any thing done save it were by his 
word. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="32">17:32</b></a>   And after they had crossed the river Jordan he did make them mighty

<tr><td><b><a name="33">17:33</b></a>   And now, do ye suppose that the children of this land, who were in

righteous?  Behold, I say unto you, Nay. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

curse the land against them, and bless it unto our fathers; yea, he did curse it against 
them unto their destruction, and he did bless it unto our fathers unto their obtaining 
power over it. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

straitens murmurers by sending fiery flying serpents to bite and kill them. (See <a href="../../num/21.html#6">Numbers 21:6</a>)

<p><i>"And he did straiten them in the wilderness with his rod ... the Lord straitened 
them because of their iniquity. He sent fiery flying serpents among them; and after they were bitten he prepared a way that they might be 
healed; and the labor which they had to perform was to look; and because of the simpleness of the way, or the easiness of it, there were

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (17:45-55)

<p>(17:45) Then Nephi reminded them about stuff they'd already seen on the trip: talking angels from time to time 
that sometimes whispered and sometimes screamed so loudly that the earth shook.

<p><i>"Ye have seen an angel, and he spake unto you; yea, ye have heard his voice from time to time; and he hath 
spoken unto you in a still small voice, but ye were past feeling, that ye could not feel his words; wherefore, he 
has spoken unto you like unto the voice of thunder, which did cause the earth to shake as if it were to divide asunder."</i>

<p>(17:48) But Nephi's brothers were tired of Nephi and his screaming angels. So they tried to throw him into the sea. 
It didn't work, though, because Nephi was filled with the power of God even to the consuming of his flesh and whoever 
touched him would wither like a dried reed.

<p><i>"And now it came to pass that when I had spoken these words, they were angry with me, and were desirous to throw me 
into the depths of the sea; and as they came forth to lay their hands upon me I spake unto them, saying: In the name of the 
Almighty God, I command you that ye touch me not, for I am filled with the power of God, even unto the consuming of my flesh; 
and whoso shall lay his hands upon me shall wither even as a dried reed; and he shall be as naught before the power of God, 
for God shall smite him."</i>

<p>(17:52) Nephi kept talking on and on about many things to his brothers. Finally Nephi's brothers gave up and durst not touch Nephi 
with their fingers for the space of many days.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said many things unto my brethren, insomuch that they were confounded and could not contend 
against me; neither durst they lay their hands upon me nor touch me with their fingers, even for the space of many days. Now they durst 
not do this lest they should wither before me, so powerful was the Spirit of God; and thus it had wrought upon them."</i>

<p>(17:53) Still, God wasn't completely satisfied. He decided not to wither Nephi's brothers like dried reeds, but to shock the hell out 
of them instead, just to show off a bit.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: Stretch forth thine hand again unto thy brethren, and they shall not wither before 
thee, but I will shock them, saith the Lord, and this will I do, that they may know that I am the Lord their God."</i>

<p>(17:54) And it came to pass that Nephi stretched forth his hand to his brethren and they didn't wither, but the Lord did shake them, 
just like he said that he would.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that I stretched forth my hand unto my brethren, and they did not wither before me; but the Lord did shake them, 
even according to the word which he had spoken."</i>

<p>(17:55) And <i>that</i> did the trick. After God shocked Nephi's brothers they knew of a surety that God was with Nephi. They even wanted to 
worship Nephi, but Nephi told them not to, saying, "Oh My Heck, you guys, I'm just your younger brother."

<p><i>"And now, they said: We know of a surety that the Lord is with thee, for we know that it is the power of the Lord that has shaken us. 
And they fell down before me, and were about to worship me, but I would not suffer them, saying: I am thy brother, yea, even thy younger 
brother."</i>
