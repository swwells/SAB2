  After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib king of
    Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fenced
    cities, and thought to win them for himself.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed
    to fight against Jerusalem,<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of

  So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the fountains,

    kings of Assyria come, and find much water?<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="5">32:5</A></B>
  Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken,
    and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo
    in the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="6">32:6</A></B>
  And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to
    him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them,
    saying,<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="7">32:7</A></B>
  Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of

  After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem,
    (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him,)
    unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem,
    saying,<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine
    and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of
    the king of Assyria?<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="12">32:12</A></B>
  Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and

  <tr><td><B><A name="13">32:13</A></B>

  <tr><td><B><A name="15">32:15</A></B>
  Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this
    manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was
    able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my
    fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And his servants spake yet more against the LORD God, and against his

  He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and to speak

    deliver his people out of mine hand.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="18">32:18</A></B>
  Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the people of
