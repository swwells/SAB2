(2:5-6) <i>"In Bethlehem of Judaea"</i>

<p>Matthew claims that Jesus' birth in Bethlehem fulfils this prophecy. But this is unlikely since

<OL>
  <LI>"Bethlehem Ephratah" in <a href="../mic/5.html#2">Micah 5:2</a> refers not to a town, but to a
    clan: the clan of Bethlehem, who was the son of Caleb's second wife,
    Ephrathah (<A href="../1chr/2.html#18">1 Chr.2:18</A>, <A
    href="../1chr/2.html#50">2:50-52</A>, <A href="../1chr/4.html#4">4:4</A>).
    
  <p><LI>The prophecy (if that is what it is) does not refer to the Messiah, but
    rather to a military leader, as can be seen from verse <A href="5.html#6">5:6</A>.
    This leader is supposed to defeat the Assyrians, which, of course, Jesus
    never did.
</OL>

It should also be noted that Matthew altered the text of Micah 5:2 by saying:
"And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Judah" rather than "Bethlehem
Ephratah" as is said in Micah 5:2. He did this, intentionally no doubt, to
make the verse appear to refer to the town of Bethlehem rather than the family
clan.

<p><img src="../images/sci1.gif" height="30"> (2:9) <i>"The star, which they
    saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the
    young child was."</i><br>
If the star "went before them," leading them to Bethlehem, then it couldn't have been a star or any 
other astronomical object or event. But Matthew couldn't have known that. Everyone at the time 
thought that stars were just little points of light a short distance above the earth. It'd be no 
problem to have one hover above a particular place for a while.

<p><img src="../images/contra1.gif" width="32" height="32">(2:11) <i>"And when they were come into the house"</i><br>
<a href="../contra/before_birth.html">Where did Joseph and Mary live before the birth of Jesus?</a>

<p><img src="../images/contra1.gif" height="30"> (2:14) <i>"He took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:"</i> 
According to Matthew, Mary, and the baby Jesus left for Egypt soon after Jesus' birth, yet Luke (<A href="../lk/2.html#39">2:39</A>) says they 
went directly to Nazareth.<br>
<A href="../contra/egypt.html">Did Jesus, Mary, and Joseph go to Egypt or Nazareth?</a>

<p><img src="../images/pr1.gif" height="30"> (2:15) <i>"Out of Egypt I have called my son."</i><br>
Matthew claims that the flight of Jesus' family to Egypt is a fulfillment of <a href="../hos/11.html#1">Hosea 11:1</a>. But Hosea 11:1 
is not a prophecy at all, as is clear when the entire verse is quoted ("When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and 
called my son out of Egypt."). It is a reference to the Hebrew exodus from Egypt and has nothing to do with Jesus. 
Matthew tries to hide this fact by quoting only the last part of the verse.

<p><img src="../images/sci1.gif" height="30"> (2:16) <i>"Herod ... slew all the children that were in 
Bethlehem ... from two years old and under."</i> Herod kills all boys in and around Bethlehem
that are two years old and under. Such a massacre would certainly have been
noted by contemporary historians. Yet not even Josephus, who documented Herod's
life in detail, mentioned this event.

<p><img src="../images/pr1.gif" height="30"> (2:17) <i>"Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet"</i> 
Matthew quotes <A href="../jer/31.html#15">Jeremiah
31:15</A>, claiming that it was a prophecy of King Herod's alleged slaughter of
the children in and around Bethlehem after the birth of Jesus. But this verse
refers to the Babylonian captivity, as is clear by reading the next two verses
(16 and 17), and, thus, has nothing to do with Herod's massacre.

<p><img src="../images/pr1.gif" height="30"> (2:23) <i>"He shall be called a Nazarene."</i><br>
Matthew claims this was a fulfillment of prophecy, yet such a prophecy is not
found anywhere in the Old Testament.

  And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the

  <tr><td><B><A name="9">2:9</A></B>
  When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, <span class="sci">the star, which they

  And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to
    Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother,
