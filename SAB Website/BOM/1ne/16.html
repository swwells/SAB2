<p><font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/wom1.gif">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (16:7) Nephi, his brothers, and Zoram (Laban's servant) all got
 married to Ishmael's nameless daughters.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that I, Nephi, took one of the daughters of Ishmael to wife; and also, my brethren took of the daughters 
of Ishmael to wife; and also Zoram took the eldest daughter of Ishmael to wife."</i>

<p>It was a group wedding with Lehi serving as the Reverend Moon, saying stuff like, "Do you [Nephi, Laman, Lemuel, Sam, Zoram] 
take what's her name here to be your lawfully wedded wife?"

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (16:10-16)

<p>(16:10) After getting that all taken care of, God showed Lehi something really interesting.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that ... my father ... beheld ... a round ball of curious workmanship; and it was of fine brass. And within 
the ball were two spindles; and the one pointed the way whither we should go into the wilderness."</i>

<p>A magic brass ball of curious workmanship that was designed and made by God himself! God's magic ball had two spindles on it, 
one pointing the way to go and the other pointing in some other direction.

<p>(16:11-13) So now that they had their magic ball, they packed up camp, gathered seeds of every kind, 
crossed the River Laman, and took off in whatever direction God's brass ball pointed. After traveling for four days in a SSE direction, 
they set up camp at a place they called Shazer. (Notice how <strike>Joseph Smith</strike> Nephi gives names to pretty much every place they 
pass by, but didn't bother to tell us the name of his wife.)

<p><i>"And it came to pass that we did ... take seed of every kind ... across the river Laman. And it came to pass that we traveled 
for the space of four days, nearly a south-southeast direction, and we did pitch our tents again; and we did call the name of the place 
Shazer."</i>

<p>(16:15-16) They followed God's magic ball around for "the space of many days" in "the more fertile 
parts of the wilderness," killing stuff for food with their bows and arrows and slings.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that we did travel for the space of many days, slaying food by the way, with our bows and our arrows and our 
stones and our slings. And we did follow the directions of the ball, which led us in the more fertile parts of the wilderness."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/sci1.gif">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (16:18) <br>
And then it came to pass that Nephi broke his steel bow.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that as I, Nephi, went forth to slay food, behold, <b>I did break my bow, which was made of fine steel.</b>"</i>

<p>Of course steel didn't exist at the time, wouldn't work well for a bow anyway, and would be hard to break. But, oh well. This is the 
Book of Mormon.

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (16:19-39)

<p>(16:19) Apparently none of the other bows worked either, because after Nephi broke his no one 
else could kill a thing.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that we did return without food to our families, and ... they did suffer much for the want of food."</i>

<p>(16:20) So everyone "began to murmur exceedingly." Heck even Nephi's dad, Lehi, "began to murmur 
against the Lord."

<p><i>"And it came to pass that Laman and Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael did begin to murmur exceedingly ... and also my father began 
to murmur against the Lord his God; yea, and they were all exceedingly sorrowful, even that they did murmur against the Lord."</i>

<p>(16:23a) So Nephi made another bow and arrow out of wood and a straight stick.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did make out of wood a bow, and out of a straight stick, an arrow; wherefore, I did arm 
myself with a bow and an arrow, with a sling and with stones."</i>

<p>(16:23b) But Nephi didn't know where to hunt with his new bow. So he asked his dad (when he had 
stopped murmuring).

<p><i>"And I said unto my father: Whither shall I go to obtain food?"</i>

<p>(16:25-26) Lehi inquired of the Lord (Hey God. Where should Nephi go to kill some animals?) Then 
voice of the Lord came to Lehi telling him to look on the magic ball where he'd find a text message from God.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came unto my father ... And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord said 
unto him: Look upon the ball, and behold the things which are written."</i>

<p>(16:27) And it came to pass that when they saw the text message from God they did fear and 
tremble exceedingly.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that when my father beheld the things which were written upon the ball, he did fear and tremble exceedingly."</i>

<p>(16:28) Now the magic brass ball didn't work like a magic 8 ball. Magic 8 balls work all of the 
time for everyone, whereas the brass ball only works if you believe it will work. And, of course, Nephi believed anything and everything, 
the crazier the better.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the pointers which were in the ball, that they did work according to the faith and 
diligence and heed which we did give unto them."</i>

<p>So the pointers pointed in just the right directions if you believed that they pointed in just the right directions. (That's the way 
dousing works too.)

<p>(16:29) But the coolest thing of all was the text messages. They "changed from time 
to time" according to the faith of the person reading the message.

<p><i>"And there was also written upon them a new writing, which was plain to be read ... and it was written and changed from time to 
time, according to the faith and diligence which we gave unto it."</i>

<p>(16:30) The message on the brass ball told Nephi to go to the top of the mountain.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did go forth up into the top of the mountain, according to the directions which were 
given upon the ball."</i>

<p>(16:31) <br>So Nephi went to the mountain top to kill wild beasts.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that I did slay wild beasts, insomuch that I did obtain food for our families."</i>

<p>(16:33) After eating the wild beasts, they traveled for the space of many days.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that we did again take our journey ... and after we had 
traveled for the space of many days we did pitch our tents again, that we might tarry for the space of a time."</i>

<p>(16:34-37) Then Ishmael dies, his daughters mourn exceedingly, and Nephi's brothers and 
Ishmael's sons decide to kill Nephi and Lehi.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that Ishmael died ... And it came to pass that the 
daughters of Ishmael did mourn exceedingly ... And Laman said unto Lemuel and also unto the sons of Ishmael: Behold, let us slay 
our father, and also our brother Nephi."</i>

<p>(16:39) But then the voice of God stopped by to talk for a while. He gave them some food so they 
decided not to kill Nephi and Lehi.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that ... the voice of the Lord came and did speak many words unto them, and ... the Lord did bless us again with food, 
that we did not perish."</i>

<tr><td><b><a name="1">16:1</b></a>   And now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had made an end of speaking 
to my brethren, behold they said unto me: Thou hast declared unto us hard things, more than 
we are able to bear. 


<tr><td><b><a name="2">16:2</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that I said unto them that 
I knew that I had spoken hard things against the wicked, according to the truth; and the 
righteous have I justified, and testified that they should be <span class="plag">lifted up at 
the last day</span>; 
wherefore, the guilty taketh the truth to be hard, for it cutteth them to the very 
center. 

<tr><td><b><a name="3">16:3</b></a>   And now my brethren, if ye were righteous and were willing to hearken 
to the truth, and give heed unto it, that ye might walk uprightly before God, then ye would 
not murmur because of the truth, and say: Thou speakest hard things against us. 


<tr><td><b>4<a name="4">16:4</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that I, Nephi, did exhort 
my brethren, with all diligence, to keep the commandments of the Lord. 

<tr><td><b><a name="5">16:5</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they did humble 
themselves before the Lord; insomuch that I had joy and great hopes of them, that they 
would walk in the paths of righteousness. 

<tr><td><b><a name="6">16:6</b></a>   Now, all these things were said and done as my father dwelt in a tent 
in the valley which he called Lemuel. 

<tr><td><b><a name="7">16:7</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that I, Nephi, took one of 
the daughters of Ishmael to wife; and also, my brethren took of the daughters of Ishmael
 to wife; and also Zoram took the eldest daughter of Ishmael to wife. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="8">16:8</b></a>   And thus my father had fulfilled all the commandments of the Lord which 
had been given unto him.  And also, I, Nephi, had been blessed of the 
Lord <span class="a">exceedingly</span>. 

<tr><td><b><a name="9">16:9</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the voice of the Lord 
spake unto my father by night, and commanded him that on the morrow he should take his 
journey into the wilderness. 

<tr><td><b><a name="10">16:10</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that</span> as <span class="a">my 
father</span> arose in the morning, and went forth to the tent door, to his great astonishment he 
<span class="a">beheld</span> upon the ground <span class="a">a round ball of curious workmanship; and it was of 
fine brass.  And within the ball were two spindles; and the one pointed the way whither we 
should go into the wilderness.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="11">16:11</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that we did</span> gather together 
whatsoever things we should carry into the wilderness, and all the remainder of our 
provisions which the Lord had given unto us; and we did <span class="a">take seed of every kind</span> that we 
might carry into the wilderness. 

<tr><td><b><a name="12">16:12</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that we did take our tents 
and depart into the wilderness, <span class="a">across the river Laman</span>. 

<tr><td><b><a name="13">16:13</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that we traveled for the 
space of four days, nearly a south-southeast direction, and we did pitch our tents again; 
and we did call the name of the place Shazer. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="14">16:14</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that we did take our bows 
and our arrows, and go forth into the wilderness to slay food for our families; and after 
we had slain food for our families we did return again to our families in the wilderness, 
to the place of Shazer.  And we did go forth again in the wilderness, following the same 
direction, keeping in the most fertile parts of the wilderness, which were in the borders 
near the Red Sea. 

<tr><td><b><a name="15">16:15</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that we did travel for the 
space of many days, slaying food by the way, with our bows and our arrows and our stones 
and our slings. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="16">16:16</b></a>   And <span class="a">we did follow the directions of the ball, 
which led us in the more fertile parts of the wilderness.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="17">16:17</b></a>   And after we had traveled for the space of many days, we did pitch our 
tents for the space of a time, that we might again rest ourselves and obtain food for our 
families. 

<tr><td><b><a name="18">16:18</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that as I, Nephi, went 
forth to slay food, behold, </span><span class="sci">I did break my bow, which was made of fine 
steel</span>; and after I 
did break my bow, behold, my brethren were angry with me because of the loss of my bow, for 
we did obtain no food. 

<tr><td><b><a name="19">16:19</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that we did return without 
food to our families, and</span> being much fatigued, because of their journeying, <span class="a">they did suffer 
much for the want of food. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="20">16:20</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that Laman and Lemuel and 
the sons of Ishmael did begin to murmur exceedingly, because of their 
sufferings and afflictions in the wilderness; and also my father began to murmur against 
the Lord his God; yea, and they were all exceedingly sorrowful, even 
that they did murmur against the Lord. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="21">16:21</b></a>   Now <span class="a">it came to pass</span> that I, Nephi, having been 
afflicted with my brethren because of the loss of my bow, and their bows having lost their 
springs, it began to be <span class="a">exceedingly</span> difficult, yea, insomuch that 
we could obtain no food. 

<tr><td><b><a name="22">16:22</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that I, Nephi, did speak 
much unto my brethren, because they had hardened their hearts again, even unto complaining 
against the Lord their God. 

<tr><td><b><a name="23">16:23</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did make out 
of wood a bow, and out of a straight stick, an arrow; wherefore, I did arm myself with a 
bow and an arrow, with a sling and with stones.   And I said unto my father: Whither shall 
I go to obtain food? </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="24">16:24</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that he did inquire of the 
Lord, for they had humbled themselves because of my words; for I did say many things unto 
them in the energy of my soul. 

<tr><td><b><a name="25">16:25</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord 
came unto my father</span>; and he was truly chastened because of his murmuring against the Lord, 
insomuch that he was brought down into the depths of sorrow. 

<tr><td><b><a name="26">16:26</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass 
that the voice of the Lord said unto him: Look upon the ball, and behold 
the things which are written.</span>

<tr><td><b><a name="27">16:27</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that <span class="a">when 
my father beheld the things which were written upon the ball, he did fear and 
tremble </span><span class="a">exceedingly</span>, and also my brethren and the sons of Ishmael 
and our wives. 

<tr><td><b><a name="28">16:28</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that I, Nephi, 
beheld the pointers which were in the ball, that they did work according to the faith and 
diligence and heed which we did give unto them.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="29">16:29</b></a>   <span class="a">And there was also written upon them a 
new writing, which was plain to 
be read</span>, which did give us understanding concerning the ways of the Lord; <span class="a">and it was 
written and changed from time to time, according to the faith and diligence which we gave 
unto it.</span> And thus we see that by small means the Lord can bring about great things. 

<tr><td><b><a name="30">16:30</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that <span class="a">I, 
Nephi, did go forth up into the top of the mountain, according to the directions which were given 
upon the ball.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="31">16:31</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that I did slay wild 
beasts, insomuch that I did obtain food for our families. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="32">16:32</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that I did return to our 
tents, bearing the beasts which I had slain; and now when they beheld that I had obtained 
food, how great was their joy!  <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they did 
humble themselves before the Lord, and did give thanks unto him. 

<tr><td><b><a name="33">16:33</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that we did again take our 
journey</span>, traveling nearly the same course as in the beginning; <span class="a">and after we had traveled 
for the space of many days we did pitch our tents again, that we might tarry for the space 
of a time.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="34">16:34</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that Ishmael died</span>, and was 
buried in the place which was called Nahom. 

<tr><td><b><a name="35">16:35</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that the daughters of 
Ishmael did mourn exceedingly</span>, because of the loss of their father, 
and because of their afflictions in the wilderness; and they did murmur against my father, 
because he had brought them out of the land of Jerusalem, saying: Our father is dead; yea, 
and we have wandered much in the wilderness, and we have suffered much affliction, hunger, 
thirst, and fatigue; and after all these sufferings we must perish in the wilderness with 
hunger. 

<tr><td><b><a name="36">16:36</b></a>   And thus they did murmur against my father, and also against me; and 
they were desirous to return again to Jerusalem. 

<tr><td><b><a name="37">16:37</b></a>   <span class="a">And Laman said unto Lemuel and also unto the sons of Ishmael: Behold, 
let us slay our father, and also our brother Nephi</span>, who has taken it upon him to be our 
ruler and our teacher, who are his elder brethren. 

<tr><td><b><a name="38">16:38</b></a>   Now, he says that the Lord has talked with him, and also that angels 
have ministered unto him.  But behold, we know that he lies unto us; and he tells us these 
things, and he worketh many things by his cunning arts, that he may deceive our eyes, 
thinking, perhaps, that he may lead us away into some strange wilderness; and after he 
has led us away, he has thought to make himself a king and a ruler over us, that he may 
do with us according to his will and pleasure.  And after this manner did my brother Laman 
stir up their hearts to anger. 

<tr><td><b><a name="39">16:39</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that</span> the Lord was with us, 
yea, even <span class="a">the voice of the Lord came and did speak many words unto them, and</span> did chasten 
them exceedingly; and after they were chastened by the voice of the Lord they did turn away 
their anger, and did repent of their sins, insomuch that <span class="a">the Lord did bless us again with 
food, that we did not perish.</span>
