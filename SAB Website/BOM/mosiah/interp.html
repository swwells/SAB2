<p><li>"And even I, myself [me, myself, and I, i.e., Mosiah], have labored with mine own hands that I might serve you, and that ye should not 
be laden with taxes."<br>
(Mosiah was a card-carrying member of the Republican party.) <a href="2.html#14">2:14</a>

<p><li>Jesus, who wouldn't be born for another 120 years or so, will be both the Son of God and the Father of heaven and earth.

<p><li> Although it is not entirely clear, Zeniff seems to be criticized for having "many wives and concubines." <a href="11.html#2">11:2</a>

<p><li>"And he </i>[Noah]</i> <i>laid a tax of one fifth part of all they possessed."</i><br>
Since Zeniff was a bad guy (who "did not keep the commandments of the Lord") and he taxed the people 20%, I guess God (or Joseph Smith) didn't 
approve of flat taxes -- or maybe taxes of any kind. <a href="11.html#3">11:3</a>
