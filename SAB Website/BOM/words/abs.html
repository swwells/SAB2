<p><li>"Words of Mormon" was engraved on golden plates by a Mormon prophet named Mormon <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/w-of-m/1?lang=eng">about 
	385 CE</a>. Mormon entrusted the golden plates to his son Moroni, who buried them on a hill in what would later become Wayne County, New 
	York. 1400 years later, after being resurrected as an angel, Moroni delivered the 
	golden plates to Joseph Smith. <a href="1.html#1">1-2</a>

<p><li>Mormon finds and abridges the plates of Nephi, which were written over a period of about 1000 years. He wrote down 
less than one percent of all the stuff that was written, for which we should all be grateful. What he wrote he thinks is 
choice; he wrote it while the spirit of the Lord whispered to him. And he knows it will be preserved because it's such great 
stuff. <a href="1.html#3">3-11</a>

<p><li>"My prayer to God is concerning my brethren ... that they may once again be a delightsome people." <a href="1.html#9">9</a>

<p><li>"For behold, king Benjamin was a holy man  ... and there were many holy men ... 
 and they did use much sharpness because of the stiffneckedness of the people." <a href="1.html#17">17</a>
