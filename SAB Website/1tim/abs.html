<p><li>"Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies." If we follow this advice we would ignore 
most of the Bible -- especially the genealogies found in <A href="../gen/10.html">Gen 10</A>,
<A href="../1chr/1.html">1 Chr 1-9</A>, <A href="../mt/1.html">Mt 1</A>, and <A
href="../lk/3.html">Lk 3</A>. <a href="1.html#4">1:4</a>

<p><li>"Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn
    not to blaspheme." Apparently (see <a href="../2tim/2.html#16">2 Tim 2:16-18</a> 
and <a href="../2tim/4.html#14">4:14-15</a>) their "blasphemy" was disagreeing with Paul. <a href="1.html#20">1:20</a>

<p><li> Men are superior to women since Adam was made before, and sinned after, Eve. But even though women are
inferior to men, they shouldn't be discouraged because they shall "be saved in childbearing." <a href="2.html#14">2:14-15</a>

<p><li>"A bishop must be ... the husband of one wife." Apparently, it's OK for laymen to have several. <a href="3.html#2">3:2</a>

<p><li>"In the latter times some shall depart from the faith" by becoming vegetarians. <a href="4.html#1">4:1-4</a>

<p><li>"Bodily exercise profiteth little." <a href="4.html#8">4:8</a>

<p><li>You should help a widow only if she: has no children or nephews; 
is desolate, trusts in God, and prays all the time; is not living in pleasure (a widow living in pleasure is the living dead); 
is over 60 years old; had only one husband; has raised children; has lodged strangers; has washed the saints' feet; has relieved 
the afflicted; and has diligently followed every good work. <a href="5.html#3">5:3-10</a>

<p><li>Never help a young widow (one under 60 years old). When they wax wanton against Christ, they'll get 
married, and be damned to hell for rejecting their faith. Besides, young widows are idle busybodies, wandering around from house to house saying 
things they shouldn't say. They should get married and have children (though 
they'll be damned to hell for it). Heck, some of them have already turned aside after Satan. <a href="5.html#11">5:11-15</a>

<p><li>Paul advises us to stop drinking water. Rather, he says that we should drink wine for our "stomach's" sakes.
 <a href="5.html#23">5:23</a>
