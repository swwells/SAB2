<img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (5:3-10) Honoring widows indeed

<p>You should help a widow only if she: has no children or nephews; is desolate, trusts in God, and prays all the time; is not living in pleasure (a widow living in pleasure is the living dead);
is over 60 years old; had only one husband; has raised children; has lodged strangers; has washed the saints' feet; has relieved the afflicted; and has diligently followed every good work.

<p>(5:3) <i>"Honour widows that are widows indeed."</i>

<p>(5:4) <i>"But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents."</i>

<p>(5:5) <i>"Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day."</i>

<p>(5:6) <i>"But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth."</i>

<p>(5:9) <i>"Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man."</i>

<p>(5:10) <i>"Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' 
feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work."</i>

<p><img src="../images/contra1.gif"> (5:8) <i>"If any provide not
    for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the
    faith, and is worse than an infidel."</i><br>

<img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (5:11-15) Never help a young widow (one under 60 years old). When they wax wanton against Christ, they'll get 
married, and be damned to hell for rejecting their faith. Besides, young widows are idle busybodies, wandering around from house to house saying 
things they shouldn't say. They should get married and have children (though 
they'll be damned to hell for it). Heck, some of them have already turned aside after Satan.

<p>(5:11) <i>"But the younger widows refuse</i> [to help]<i>: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;"</i>

<p>(5:12) <i>"Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith."</i>

<p>(5:13) <i>"They learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; 
and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not."</i>

<p>(5:14) <i>"I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children."</i>
