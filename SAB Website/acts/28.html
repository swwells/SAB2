Paul is bitten by a poisonous snake and yet
lives. The &quot;barbarians&quot; who were shipwrecked with him thought he must
be a murderer since he was bitten; but then they changed their minds and thought
him to be a god since he didn't die. (The snake story is especially interesting since there 
are no poisonous snakes on Malta, and there is no evidence of their existence in the past.)

<p>(28:3) <i>"When Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper
    out of the heat, and fastened on his hand."</i>
    
<p>(28:4) <i>"The barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, 
whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live."</i>

<p>(28:5) <i>"He shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm."</i>

<p>(28:6) <i>"He should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but ... saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, 
and said that he was a god."</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif" >
<img src="../images/sci1.gif" >(28:8-9) <br>By praying and touching the sick people of Malta,
 Paul cures them of their diseases.
 
 <p>(28:8) <i>"The father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, 
 and laid his hands on him, and healed him."</i>
 
  <p>(28:9) <i>"When this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed."</i>
