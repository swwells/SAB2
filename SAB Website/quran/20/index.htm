Who hath appointed the earth as a bed and hath threaded roads for you  therein and hath sent down water from the sky and thereby We have brought forth  divers kinds of vegetation, <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

And We verily did show him all Our tokens, but he denied them and refused. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

He said: Hast come to drive us out from our land by thy magic, O Moses ? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

But we surely can produce for thee magic the like thereof; so appoint a tryst  between us and you, which neither we nor thou shall fail to keep, at a place  convenient (to us both). <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><a NAME="59"><b>20:59</a></b>
(Moses) said: Your tryst shall be the day of the feast, and let the people  assemble when the sun hath risen high. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Then Pharaoh went and gathered his strength, then came (to the appointed  tryst). <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Moses said unto them: Woe unto you! Invent not a lie against Allah, lest He  extirpate you by some punishment. He who lieth faileth miserably. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Then they debated one with another what they must do, and they kept their  counsel secret. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

They said: Lo! these are two wizards who would drive you out from your  country by their magic, and destroy your best traditions; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

So arrange your plan, and come in battle line. Whoso is uppermost this day  will be indeed successful. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

He said: Nay, do ye throw! Then lo! their cords and their staves, by their  magic, appeared to him as though they ran. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

And Moses conceived a fear in his mind. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

We said: Fear not! Lo! thou art the higher. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Throw that which is in thy right hand! It will eat up that which they have  made. Lo! that which they have made is but a wizard's artifice, and a wizard shall not  be successful to whatever point (of skill) he may attain. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Then the wizards were (all) flung down prostrate, crying: We believe in the  Lord of Aaron and Moses. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
