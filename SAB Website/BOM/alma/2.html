"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",
"<span class='i'>Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever.</span>--<a href='3.html#14'>Alma 3:14</a>",
"<span class='i'>I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</span>--<a href='3.html#15'>Alma 3:15</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",
"<span class='a'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges ... even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year....</span>--<a href='16.html#1'>Alma 16:1</a>",
"<span class='a'>Their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.</span>--<a href='16.html#11'>Alma 16:11</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.   Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</span>--<a href='30.html#22'>Alma 30:22</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",
"<span class='i'>God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.</span>--<a href='30.html#47'>Alma 30:47</a>",
"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Amalekites were of a more wicked and murderous disposition than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='43.html#6'>Alma 43:6</a>",

"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",
"<span class='i'>These dissenters ... became ... more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='47.html#36'>Alma 47:36</a>",
"<span class='a'>God would prosper them in the land, or in other words ... God ... would prosper them in the land.</span>--<a href='48.html#15'>Alma 48:15</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='50.html#22'>Alma 50:22</a>",
"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",
"<span class='i'>The remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty.</span>--<a href='51.html#20'>Alma 51:20</a>",
"<span class='g'>And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye.</span>--<a href='54.html#21'>Alma 54:21</a>",

to be a contention among the people; for a certain man, being called Amlici, he being a very cunning man, yea, a wise 
man as to the wisdom of the world, he being after the order of the man that slew Gideon by the sword, who was executed 
according to the law --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a> <br>
(2:1, 5, 7, 9, 14, 15, 19, 20, 23, 26, 29, 30, 35, 38)
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>2:2</b>   Now this Amlici had, by his cunning, drawn away much people after him; even so much that they began to 
be very powerful; and they began to endeavor to establish Amlici to be king over the people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>2:3</b>   Now this was alarming to the people of the church, and also to all those who had not been drawn away 
after the persuasions of Amlici; for they knew that according to their law that such things must be established by the 
voice of the people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>2:4</b>   Therefore, if it were possible that Amlici should gain the voice of the people, he, being a wicked man, 
would deprive them of their rights and privileges of the church; for it was his intent to destroy the church of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>2:5</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the people assembled themselves together throughout all 
the land, every man according to his mind, whether it were for or against Amlici, in separate bodies, having much dispute 
and wonderful contentions one with another. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>2:6</b>   And thus they did assemble themselves together to cast in their voices concerning the matter; and they 
were laid before the judges. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>2:7</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the voice of the people came against Amlici, that he was 
not made king over the people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>2:8</b>   Now this did cause much joy in the hearts of those who were against him; but Amlici did stir up those 
who were in his favor to anger against those who were not in his favor. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>2:8</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they gathered themselves together, and did consecrate 
Amlici to be their king. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>2:10</b>   Now when Amlici was made king over them he commanded them that they should take up arms against their 
brethren; and this he did that he might subject them to him. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>2:11</b>   Now the people of Amlici were distinguished by the name of Amlici, being called Amlicites; and the 
remainder were called Nephites, or the people of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>2:12</b>   Therefore the people of the Nephites were aware of the intent of the Amlicites, and therefore they did 
prepare to meet them; yea, <span class="sci">they did arm themselves with swords, and with cimeters</span>, and with bows, and with arrows, 
and with stones, and with slings, <span class="sci">and with all manner of weapons of war, of every kind.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/sci1.gif" width="32" height="32"><br>
<font size="-1">The Amlicites were armed with swords and cimeters (ca. 87 BCE). But no evidence for these weapons has 
ever been found.</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>2:13</b>   And thus they were prepared to meet the Amlicites at the time of their coming.  And there were appointed 
captains, and higher captains, and chief captains, according to their numbers. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>2:14</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Amlici did arm his men with all manner of weapons of 
war of every kind; and he also appointed rulers and leaders over his people, to lead them to war against their 
brethren. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>2:15</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Amlicites came upon the hill Amnihu, which was 
east of the river Sidon, which ran by the land of Zarahemla, and there they began to make war with the Nephites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>2:16</b>   Now Alma, being the chief judge and the governor of the people of Nephi, therefore he went up with his 
people, yea, with his captains, and chief captains, yea, at the head of his armies, against the Amlicites to battle. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>2:17</b>   And they began to slay the Amlicites upon the hill east of Sidon.  And the Amlicites did contend with 
the Nephites with great strength, insomuch that many of the Nephites did fall before the Amlicites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>2:18</b>   Nevertheless <span class="v">the Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that 
they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, that they began to flee before them.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<span class="v">did slay them with much slaughter, insomuch that there were slain of the Amlicites twelve thousand five hundred thirty

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>2:20</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when Alma could pursue the Amlicites no longer he caused 
that his people should pitch their tents in the valley of Gideon, the valley being called after that Gideon who was 
slain by the hand of Nehor with the sword; and in this valley the Nephites did pitch their tents for the night. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>2:21</b>   And Alma sent spies to follow the remnant of the Amlicites, that he might know of their plans and their 
plots, whereby he might guard himself against them, that he might preserve his people from being destroyed. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>2:22</b>   Now those whom he had sent out to watch the camp of the Amlicites were called Zeram, and Amnor, and 
Manti, and Limher; these were they who went out with their men to watch the camp of the Amlicites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>2:23</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that on the morrow they returned into the camp of the 
Nephites in great haste, being greatly astonished, and struck with much fear, saying: <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>2:24</b>   Behold, we followed the camp of the Amlicites, and to our great astonishment, in the land of Minon, 
above the land of Zarahemla, in the course of the land of Nephi, we saw a numerous host of the Lamanites; and behold, the 
Amlicites have joined them; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>2:25</b>   And they are upon our brethren in that land; and they are fleeing before them with their flocks, and 
their wives, and their children, towards our city; and except we make haste they obtain possession of our city, and our 
fathers, and our wives, and our children be slain. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>2:26</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the people of Nephi took their tents, and departed out 
of the valley of Gideon towards their city, which was the city of Zarahemla. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>2:27</b>   And behold, as they were crossing the river Sidon, the Lamanites and the Amlicites, being as numerous 
almost, as it were, as the sands of the sea, came upon them to destroy them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>2:28</b>   Nevertheless, the Nephites being strengthened by the hand of the Lord, having prayed mightily to him 
that he would deliver them out of the hands of their enemies, therefore <span class="i">the Lord did hear their cries, and did 
strengthen them, and the Lamanites and the Amlicites did fall before them.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">The Lord did hear their cries [he had his hearing aid on, ... and the Lamanites and Amlicites did fall

<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>2:29</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Alma fought with Amlici with the sword, face to face; 
and they did contend mightily, one with another. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>2:30</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Alma, being a man of God, being exercised with much 
faith, cried, saying: O Lord, have mercy and spare my life, that I may be an instrument in thy hands to save and preserve 
this people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>2:31</b>   Now when Alma had said these words he contended again with Amlici; and he was strengthened, insomuch 
that he slew Amlici with the sword. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="32"></a>2:32</b>   And he also contended with the king of the Lamanites; but the king of the Lamanites fled back from before 
Alma and sent his guards to contend with Alma. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="33"></a>2:33</b>   But Alma, with his guards, contended with the guards of the king of the Lamanites until he slew and 
drove them back. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="34"></a>2:34</b>   And thus he cleared the ground, or rather the bank, which was on the west of the river Sidon, 
throwing the bodies of the Lamanites who had been slain into the waters of Sidon, that thereby his people might have 
room to cross and contend with the Lamanites and the Amlicites on the west side of the river Sidon. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="35"></a>2:35</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when they had all crossed the river Sidon that the 
Lamanites and the Amlicites began to flee before them, notwithstanding they were so numerous that they could not be 
numbered. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="36"></a>2:36</b>   And they fled before the Nephites towards the wilderness which was west and north, away beyond the 
borders of the land; and the Nephites did pursue them with their might, and did slay them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="37"></a>2:37</b>   Yea, they were met on every hand, and slain and driven, until they were scattered on the west, and on 
the north, until they had reached the wilderness, which was called Hermounts; and it was that part of the wilderness 
which was infested by wild and ravenous beasts. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="38"></a>2:38</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that many died in the wilderness of their wounds, and were 
devoured by those beasts and also the vultures of the air; and their bones have been found, and have been heaped up on 
the earth. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
