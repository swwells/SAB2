<p><li>There are only two churches: the church of the Lamb of God, and the church of the 
devil. You either belong to the good church or the bad church (&quot;the mother of abominations, 
the whore of all the earth, whose founder is the devil). <a href="14.html#10">14:10</a>

<p><li>"The whore of all the earth sat upon many waters." <a href="1.html#11">14:11</a>

<p><li>The angel showed Nephi the Mormon church (the church of the Lamb of God). There weren't many Mormons, though, because of that 
fucking whore that sat on many waters (the Catholic Church). <a href="14.html#12">14:12</a>

<p><li>"The wrath of God is upon the mother of harlots." <a href="14.html#16">14:16</a>

<p><li>"The wrath of God is poured out upon the mother of harlots, which 
is the great and abominable church ... whose founder is the devil."
 <a href="14.html#17">14:17</a>
 
 <p><li>The white-robed guy will write things that are just and true just like everything else that is written in 
 "the book that proceeded out of the mouth of the Jew." ("The book that prceeded out of the mouth of the Jew" 
 is BoM-speak for the Bible.) <a href="14.html#23">14:23</a>
 
<p><li>God will force people to eat their own flesh and drink their own blood. <a href="21.html#26">21:26</a>
<p><li>The members of "the great and abominable church" (the whore of all the earth) will kill each other and 
get drunk on their own blood. <a href="22.html#13">22:13</a>
<p><li>All those that fight again Zion (Mormonism), like "that great whore, that great and abominable church" 
will be destroyed. <a href="22.html#14">22:14</a>
