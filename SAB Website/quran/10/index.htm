If Allah were to hasten on for men the ill (that they have earned) as they  would hasten on the good, their respite would already have expired. But We suffer  those who look not for the meeting with Us to wander blindly on in their contumacy. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

And if misfortune touch a man he crieth unto Us, (while reclining) on his  side, or sitting or standing, but when We have relieved him of the misfortune he goeth  his way as though he had not cried unto Us because of a misfortune that afflicted him.  Thus is what they do made (seeming) fair unto the prodigal. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

And <span class="a">when Our clear revelations are recited unto them, they who look not for  the meeting with Us say: Bring a Lecture other than this, or

The Quran is so perfect it could never be invented. Go ahead and try to write a Surah as great as those in the Quran.

<p>Okay. Here's one that's better than the Quran's <a href="../111/index.htm">Surah 111</a> (as quoted in <a

"In the name of Marvin, most-merciful, all-compassionate:  <br>
Damn both hands of my neighbor Sam; damn him!  <br>
His money and children will not save him!  <br>
He will be burnt in a blazing flame --<br>
Sam and his dame, who is also to blame.<br>
As she was carrying wood to her home,<br>
She put some thorns in the path where I roam.<br>
So she shall suffer a torment most dire,<br>
Dangling in hell from a noose of palm-fibre."
