"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",
"<span class='i'>Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever.</span>--<a href='3.html#14'>Alma 3:14</a>",
"<span class='i'>I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</span>--<a href='3.html#15'>Alma 3:15</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",
"<span class='a'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges ... even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year....</span>--<a href='16.html#1'>Alma 16:1</a>",
"<span class='a'>Their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.</span>--<a href='16.html#11'>Alma 16:11</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.   Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</span>--<a href='30.html#22'>Alma 30:22</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",

"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",

"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",
"<span class='i'>These dissenters ... became ... more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='47.html#36'>Alma 47:36</a>",
"<span class='a'>God would prosper them in the land, or in other words ... God ... would prosper them in the land.</span>--<a href='48.html#15'>Alma 48:15</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='50.html#22'>Alma 50:22</a>",
"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",
"<span class='i'>The remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty.</span>--<a href='51.html#20'>Alma 51:20</a>",
"<span class='g'>And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye.</span>--<a href='54.html#21'>Alma 54:21</a>",

<td bgcolor="eeeeee">


<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>47:1</b>   Now we will return in our record to Amalickiah and those who had fled with him into the wilderness; 
for, behold, he had taken those who went with him, and went up in the land of Nephi among the Lamanites, and did 
stir up the Lamanites to anger against the people of Nephi, insomuch that the king of the Lamanites sent a proclamation 
throughout all his land, among all his people, that they should gather themselves together again to go to battle 
against the Nephites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>47:2</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when the proclamation had gone forth among them 
they were <span class="a">exceedingly</span> afraid; yea, they feared to displease the king, and they also feared 
to go to battle against the Nephites lest they should lose their lives.  <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> 
that they would not, or the more part of them would not, obey the commandments of the king. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1"><a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a><br>
[47:2 (2), 7, 10, 11(3), 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 23, 24, 27, 28, 31, 34, 35]
<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<a href="exceed_list.html">Exceedingly</a> </font>

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>47:3</b>   <span class="a">And now it came to pass</span> that the king was wroth because of their disobedience; therefore he gave 
Amalickiah the command of that part of his army which was obedient unto his commands, and commanded him that he 
should go forth and compel them to arms. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>47:4</b>   Now behold, this was the desire of Amalickiah; for he being a very subtle man to do evil 
therefore he laid the plan in his heart to dethrone the king of the Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>47:5</b>   And now he had got the command of those parts of the Lamanites who were in favor of the king; 
and he sought to gain favor of those who were not obedient; therefore he went forward to the place which was 
called Onidah, for thither had all the Lamanites fled; for they discovered the army coming, and, supposing that 
they were coming to destroy them, therefore they fled to Onidah, to the place of arms. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>47:6</b>   And they had appointed a man to be a king and a leader over them, being fixed in their minds 
with a determined resolution that they would not be subjected to go against the Nephites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>47:7</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they had gathered themselves together upon the 
top of the mount which was called Antipas, in preparation to battle. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>47:8</b>   Now it was not Amalickiah's intention to give them battle according to the commandments of the 
king; but behold, it was his intention to gain favor with the armies of the Lamanites, that he might place 
himself at their head and dethrone the king and take possession of the kingdom. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>47:9</b>   <span class="a">And behold, it came to pass</span> that he caused his army to pitch their tents in the valley which was 
near the mount Antipas. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>47:10</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when it was night he sent a secret embassy 
into the mount Antipas, desiring that the leader of those who were upon the mount, whose name was Lehonti, 
that he should come down to the foot of the mount, for he desired to speak with him. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>47:11</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when Lehonti received the message he durst not 
go down to the foot of the mount.  <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Amalickiah sent again the 
second time, desiring him to come down.  <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Lehonti would not; and 
he sent again the third time. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>47:12</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when Amalickiah found that he could not get 
Lehonti to come down off from the mount, he went up into the mount, nearly to Lehonti's camp; and he sent again 
the fourth time his message unto Lehonti, desiring that he would come down, and that he would bring his guards 
with him. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>47:13</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when Lehonti had come down with his guards 
to Amalickiah, that Amalickiah desired him to come down with his army in the night-time, and surround those 
men in their camps over whom the king had given him command, and that he would deliver them up into Lehonti's 
hands, if he would make him (Amalickiah) a second leader over the whole army. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>47:14</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Lehonti came down with his men and surrounded 
the men of Amalickiah, so that before they awoke at the dawn of day they were surrounded by the armies of 
Lehonti. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>47:15</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when they saw that they were surrounded, 
they plead with Amalickiah that he would suffer them to fall in with their brethren, that they might not be 
destroyed. Now this was the very thing which Amalickiah desired. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>47:16</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that he delivered his men, contrary to the commands 
of the king.  Now this was the thing that Amalickiah desired, that he might accomplish his designs in dethroning 
the king. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>47:17</b>   Now it was the custom among the Lamanites, if their chief leader was killed, to appoint 
the second leader to be their chief leader. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>47:18</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Amalickiah caused that one of his servants 
should administer poison by degrees to Lehonti, that he died. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>47:19</b>   Now, when Lehonti was dead, the Lamanites appointed Amalickiah to be their leader and their chief 
commander. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>47:20</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Amalickiah marched with his armies (for he had 
gained his desires) to the land of Nephi, to the city of Nephi, which was the chief city. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>47:21</b>   And the king came out to meet him with his guards, for he supposed that Amalickiah had 
fulfilled his commands, and that Amalickiah had gathered together so great an army to go against the Nephites 
to battle. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>47:22</b>   But behold, as the king came out to meet him Amalickiah caused that his servants should go 
forth to meet the king.  And they went and bowed themselves before the king, as if to reverence him because of 
his greatness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>47:23</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the king put forth his hand to raise them, 
as was the custom with the Lamanites, as a token of peace, which custom they had taken from the Nephites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>47:24</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when he had raised the first from the ground, 
behold he stabbed the king to the heart; and he fell to the earth. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>47:25</b>   Now the servants of the king fled; and the servants of Amalickiah raised a cry, saying: <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>47:26</b>   Behold, the servants of the king have stabbed him to the heart, and he has fallen and they have 
fled; behold, come and see. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>47:27</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Amalickiah commanded that his armies should 
march forth and see what had happened to the king; and when they had come to the spot, and found the king lying 
in his gore, Amalickiah pretended to be wroth, and said: Whosoever loved the king, let him go forth, and pursue 
his servants that they may be slain. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>47:28</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that all they who loved the king, when they heard 
these words, came forth and pursued after the servants of the king. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>47:29</b>   Now when the servants of the king saw an army pursuing after them, they were frightened again, 
and fled into the wilderness, and came over into the land of Zarahemla and joined the people of Ammon. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>47:30</b>   And the army which pursued after them returned, having pursued after them in vain; and thus 
Amalickiah, by his fraud, gained the hearts of the people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>47:31</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> on the morrow he entered the city Nephi with his 
armies, and took possession of the city. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="32"></a>47:32</b>   <span class="a">And now it came to pass</span> that the queen, when she had heard that the king was slain -- for 
Amalickiah had sent an embassy to the queen informing her that the king had been slain by his servants, that he 
had pursued them with his army, but it was in vain, and they had made their escape --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="33"></a>47:33</b>   Therefore, when <span class="s">the queen</span> had received this message she sent unto Amalickiah, desiring him that 
he would spare the people of the city; and she also <span class="s">desired him that he should come in unto her</span>; and she also 
desired him that he should bring witnesses with him to testify concerning the death of the king. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/sex1.gif" width="32" height="32"><br>
<font size="-1">The queen "desired him [Amalickiah that he should come in unto her." 
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="34"></a>47:34</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Amalickiah took the same servant that slew 
the king, and all them who were with him, and went in unto the queen, unto the place where she sat; and they 
all testified unto her that the king was slain by his own servants; and they said also: They have fled; does 
not this testify against them?   And thus they satisfied the queen concerning the death of the king. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="35"></a>47:35</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Amalickiah sought the favor of the queen, 
and took her unto him to wife; and thus by his fraud, and by the assistance of his cunning servants, he 
obtained the kingdom; yea, he was acknowledged king throughout all the land, among all the people of the 
Lamanites, who were composed of the Lamanites and the Lemuelites and the 
Ishmaelites, and all the dissenters of the Nephites, from the reign of Nephi down to the present time. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="36"></a>47:36</b>   Now <span class="i">these dissenters</span>, having the same instruction and the same information of the Nephites, 
yea, having been instructed in the same knowledge of the Lord, nevertheless, it is strange to relate, not 
long after their dissensions they <span class="i">became</span> more hardened and impenitent, and 
<span class="i">more wild, wicked and ferocious 
than the Lamanites -- drinking in with the traditions of the Lamanites; giving way to indolence, and all 
manner of lasciviousness; </span>yea, entirely forgetting the Lord their God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/int.gif" width="32" height="32">
<img src="../../images/inj1.gif" width="32" height="32"><br>
<font size="-1">The dissenters become even more "wild, wicked, and ferocious than the Lamanites [Native Americans, 
giving way to indolence and all manner of lasciviousness."
