<i>The story of Nehor</i> (1:2-15)<br>
Nehor was killed for teaching universalism (the belief that all will be saved).
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>1:3</b>   And he had gone about among the people, preaching to them that which he termed to be the word of God, 
bearing down against the church; declaring unto the people that every priest and teacher ought to become popular; and 
they ought not to labor with their hands, but that they ought to be supported by the people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>1:4</b>   And <span class="int">he also testified unto the people that all mankind should be saved at the last day, and that they 
need not fear nor tremble,</span> but that they might lift up their heads and rejoice; for the Lord had created all men, and 
had also redeemed all men; and, in the end, all men should have eternal life. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>1:5</b>   <span class="a"><span class="a">And it came to pass</span></span> that he did teach these things so 
much that many did believe on his words, even so many that they began to support him and give him money. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>1:6</b>   And he began to be lifted up in the pride of his heart, and to wear very costly apparel, yea, and even 
began to establish a church after the manner of his preaching. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>1:7</b>   <span class="a"><span class="a">And it came to pass</span></span> as he was going, to preach to those who 
believed on his word, he met a man who belonged to the church of God, yea, even one of their teachers; and he began to
 contend with him sharply, that he might lead away the people of the church; but the man withstood him, admonishing him 
 with the words of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>1:8</b>   Now the name of the man was Gideon; and it was he who was an instrument in the hands of God in 
 delivering the people of Limhi out of bondage. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>1:9</b>   Now, because Gideon withstood him with the words of God he was wroth with Gideon, and drew his sword 
 and began to smite him.   Now Gideon being stricken with many years, therefore he was not able to withstand his blows, 
 therefore he was slain by the sword. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>1:10</b>   And the man who slew him was taken by the people of the church, and was brought before Alma, to be 
 judged according to the crimes which he had committed. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>1:11</b>   <span class="a"><span class="a">And it came to pass</span></span> that he stood before Alma and 
 pleaded for himself with much boldness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>1:12</b>   But Alma said unto him: Behold, this is the 
	<span class="int">first time that priestcraft has been introduced among 
 this people</span>.  And behold, thou art not only guilty of priestcraft, but hast endeavored to enforce it by the sword; 
 and were priestcraft to be enforced among this people it would prove their entire destruction. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <font size="-1">
 <img src="../../images/int.gif" width="32" height="32">  <i>"Priestcraft"</i><br>
 The term "priestcraft" is an obvious attempt to denigrate the Catholic Church.

 <tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>1:13</b>   And thou hast shed the blood of a righteous man, yea, a man who has done much good 
 among this people; and <span class="i">were we to spare thee his blood would come upon us for vengeance.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

 king; and it has been acknowledged by this people; therefore this people must abide by the law. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

 <tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>1:16</b>   Nevertheless, this did not put an end to the spreading of priestcraft through the land; for there 
 were many who loved the vain things of the world, and they went forth preaching false doctrines; and this they did 
 for the sake of riches and honor. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>1:17</b>   Nevertheless, they durst not lie, if it were known, for fear of the law, for liars were punished; 
 therefore they pretended to preach according to their belief; and now the law could have no power on any man for his 
 belief. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<i>"Whosoever did not  belong to the church of God began to persecute those that

 Non-believers persecuted believers because the believers were just so darned humble.

 another, without money and without price. </span> 
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>1:21</b>   Now <span class="g">there was a strict law among the people of the church that there should not any man, belonging

 <tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>1:23</b>   Now this was in the second year of the reign of Alma, and it was a cause of much affliction to the 
 church; yea, it was the cause of much trial with the church. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>1:24</b>   For the hearts of many were hardened, and their names were blotted out, that they were remembered no

 <tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>1:25</b>   Now this was a great trial to those that did <span class="plag">stand fast in the

 <span class="plag">steadfast and immovable</span> in keeping the commandments of God, and they bore with patience the persecution which was

 <tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>1:26</b>   And when the priests left their labor to impart the word of God unto the people, the people also left 
 their labors to hear the word of God.  And when the priest had imparted unto them the word of God they all returned 
 again diligently unto their labors; and the priest, not esteeming himself above his hearers, for the preacher was no 
 better than the hearer, neither was the teacher any better than the learner; and thus they were all equal, and they 
 did all labor, every man according to his strength. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>1:27</b>   And <span class="g">they did impart of their substance, every man according to that which he had, to the poor, and

 again, notwithstanding all their persecutions. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>1:29</b>   And now, because of the steadiness of the church they began to be <span class="a">exceedingly</span> rich, having abundance

 abundance of <span class="sci">grain,</span> and of gold, and of silver, and of precious things, and abundance of

 out of the church or in the church, having no respect to persons as to those who stood in need.
