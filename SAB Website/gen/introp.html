    unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes."</I> -- <a href="19.html#8">Genesis 19:8</a>

<H3>Genesis for Skeptics</H3>

<p>Genesis has it all: sex, violence, contradictions, insults to women, absurdities, conflicts with science and history, you 
name it. Well, except for anything  good, that is. God declared his creation to be "very good" in <a href="1.html#31">1:31</a>, 
but I can't find anything good in Genesis.

<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="highlights.html" TAG="BODY" startspan --><p><li>The two contradictory creation stories. <A href="1.html#1">1:1-2:3</A>, 
  <A href="2.html#4">2:4-25</A>
  
  <p><li>God's two magic trees: The tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. <a href="2.html#9">2:9</a>
  
  <p><li>"In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." <a href="2.html#17">2:17</a>
<br>
 God says that if Adam eats from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, then the day that he does so, he will die. But 
Adam eats the forbidden fruit (<a href="3.html#6">3:6</a>) and yet lives for another 930 years (<a href="5.html#5">5:5</a>). 
  
  <p><li>God's clever, talking serpent. <A href="3.html#1">3:1</A>
  
  <p><li>God's curse of all women. <A href="3.html#16">3:16</A>
  
  <p><li>"Behold, the man is become as one of us." <a href="3.html#22">3:22</a><br>
God expels Adam and Eve from the garden before they get a chance to eat from that other tree -- the tree of life. 
God knows that if they do that, they will live forever. A spooky thought indeed for an insecure god. 
  
  <p><li>The mark of Cain. <a href="4.html#15">4:15</a>
  
  <p><li>"And Cain knew his wife."<br>
That's nice, but where the hell did she come from? <a href="4.html#17">4:17</a>
  
    <p><li>The &quot;sons of God&quot; copulated with the &quot;daughters of men,&quot; and had sons who became &quot;the

    offers his daughters to a crowd of angel rapers. <A href="19.html#8">19:8</A>
    
 <p><li>"The LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire." <A href="19.html#24">19:24</A>   
    
  <p><li>God turns Lot's wife into a pillar of salt. <a href="19.html#26">19:26</a>
    
  <p><li>A drunken Lot impregnates his daughters. <A href="19.html#30">19:30-36</A>
  
  <p><li>Abraham's second "she's my sister" lie. <a href="20.html#2">20:2</a>
  
  <p><li>God closed all the wombs in Abimelech's household to punish him for believing Abraham's lie. <a href="20.html#18">20:18</a>

  <p><li>God tells Abraham to kill his second son (Isaac) for a burnt offering. <A href="22.html#2">22:2</A>
  
  <p><li>Put your hand under my thigh (testicles) and swear. <a href="24.html#2">24:2</a>, <a href="47.html#29">47:29</a>
  
  <p><li>Isaac uses his dad's "she's my sister" lie. <a href="26.html#7">26:7</a>
