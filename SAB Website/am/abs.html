<p><li>God says there are three or four reasons for him to punish various people, he just can't remember which it is. 
<a href="1.html#3">1:3, 6, 9, 11, 13</a>, <a href="2.html#1">2:1, 4, 6</a>

<p><li> The divine pyromaniac threatens to "send fire unto" Hazael, Gaza, Tyrus, Teman, 
Rabbah, Moab, and Judah. <a href="1.html#4">1:4, 7, 10, 12, 14</a>, <a href="2.html#2">2:2, 5</a>

<p><li>God says there are three or four reasons for him to punish Moab. But he only 
mentions one: "because he burned the bones of the king of Edom." So God burned Moab because 
they burned some bones. <a href="2.html#1">2:12</a>

<p><li>God destroyed the Amorites who were a race of giants as tall 
as cedars and as strong as oaks. <a href="2.html#9">2:9</a>

<p><li>God afflicted the Israelites with "cleanness of teeth" (famine,) drought, blasting, and mildew. He killed them with pestilence, 
slaughtered them with the sword, and "made the stink of their camps come up into their noses." Destroyed them like they were from Sodom 
and Gomorrah. And yet they still didn't return to him. What is wrong with people?  </a><a href="4.html#6">4:6-11</a>

<p><li> Many Christians look forward to the &quot;day of the Lord,&quot; but according to 
these verses, they shouldn't. <a href="5.html#18">5:18-20</a>

<p><li>Woe is everyone. <a href="6.html#1">6:1-6</a>

<p><li>Woe to them ... that chant to the sound of the viol, and invent to themselves instruments of musick. <a href="6.html#5">6:5</a>

<p><li>"Woe to them ... that drink wine in bowls." <a href="6.html#6">6:6</a>

<p><li>"The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself ... I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore will I deliver up the city."
God swears to himself that he hates Jacob's palaces, so he will deliver up the city (and kill everyone in it). <a href="6.html#8">6:8</a>

<p><li><i>"Hold thy tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD."</i> <br>
    (If God hears you, he'll probably kill you, too.) <a href="6.html#10">6:10</a>
    
<p><li>Amos' first vision: God makes grass-eating grasshoppers, then repents. <a href="7.html#1">7:1-3</a>

<p><li>Amos' second vision: God burned up the earth and sea, then repents. <a href="7.html#4">7:4-6</a>

<p><li>God swears "by the excellency of Jacob." <a href="8.html#7">8:7</a>

<p><li>"Shall not the land tremble for this?"<br>
(Earthquakes are a punishment from God.) <a href="8.html#8">8:8</a>

<p><li>"I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day." <a href="8.html#9">8:9</a>

<p><li>Someday people will actually want to read the Bible. <a href="8.html#11">8:11-12</a>

<p><li>Amos sees God standing on the altar. <a href="9.html#1">9:1</a>

<p><li>God will "cut them in the head" and "slay the last of them with the sword." Any that try to escape by diving to the bottom of the sea will be bitten,
 at God's command, by a sea-serpent. God will set his "eyes upon them for evil, not for good." <a href="9.html#1">9:1-4</a>
