<p><li>Being forty days ... And in those days he did eat nothing."<br>
<a href="http://blogs.plos.org/obesitypanacea/2011/05/13/the-science-of-starvation-how-long-can-humans-survive-without-food-or-water/">The Science of Starvation: 
	How long can humans survive without food or water?</a> <a href="4.html#2">4:2</a>

<p><li>The devil takes Jesus to the top of a mountain and shows him "all the kingdoms of the world." I guess the world
was flat in those days.  <a href="4.html#5">4:5</a>

<p><li> Jesus cured Peter's mother-in-law (by "rebuking" her fever) so she could get back to work serving them. <a href="4.html#38">4:38-39</a>

<p><li>The people brought all their sick people to Jesus, and he cured every one of them. <a href="4.html#40">4:40</a>

<p><li>Jesus cures a man with leprosy. <a href="5.html#12">5:12-13</a>

<p><li>Jesus cures a paralytic by forgiving his sins, thereby proving that he is God 
(since only God can forgive sins) and paralysis is caused by sin. <a href="5.html#18">5:18-25</a>

<p><li>Jesus heals a man with a withered hand. <a href="6.html#6">6:6-10</a>

<p><li>Jesus heals people that are "vexed with unclean spirits."  <a href="6.html#18">6:18</a>

<p><li>"The whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all." <a href="6.html#19">6:19</a>

<p><li>Jesus cures the centurion's slave. <a href="7.html#2">7:2-10</a>

<p><li>"And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak." <a href="7.html#12">7:12-15</a>

<p><li>Within a single hour, Jesus cured people of various plagues, evil spirits, and blindness.  <a href="7.html#21">7:21</a>

<p><li>Jesus stops a storm by rebuking the wind and waves. <a href="8.html#23">8:23-24</a>

<p><li>Jesus heals a woman "having an issue of blood." It's the usual story: none of 
the doctors could cure her, but the faith hearer (Jesus, in this case) could. <a href="8.html#43">8:43-44</a>

<p><li>"Thy faith hath made thee whole." If you have enough faith, you will never get sick. (Illness is caused by sin and lack of faith. 
Medical science is unnecessary.) <a href="8.html#48">8:48</a>

<p><li>Jesus brings Jarius' dead daughter back to life. <a href="8.html#49">8:49-55</a>

<p><li>"He [Jesus] ... healed them that had need of healing." <a href="9.html#11">9:11</a>

<p><li>Epilepsy is caused by devils.  <a href="9.html#39">9:39</a>

<p><li>Jesus tells his disciples to do two things: heal the sick and say the 
kingdom of heaven has come upon you. <a href="10.html#9">10:9</a>    

<p><li>People who cannot speak are possessed with devils. <a href="11.html#14">11:14</a>

<p><li>"Some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief
    of the devils ... and others ... sought of him a sign from heaven."<br>
    A reasonable hypothesis (assuming devils exist) and a fair request (assuming a god exists). <a href="11.html#15">11:15-16</a>
    
<p><li>"If I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out?"<br>
    Jesus believed the Pharisees could cast out demons, too! <a href="11.html#19">11:19</a>    
    
<p><li>Jesus says it is impossible to get rid of unclean spirits. If you manage to evict one, he'll soon return with
seven others "more wicked than himself" and you'll be worse off than you were before. So just learn to live with
whatever unclean spirits that are currently possessing you.  <a href="11.html#24">11:24-26</a>

<p><li>Jesus heals ten lepers. <a href="17.html#12">17:12-14</a>

<p><li>  Jesus believed the story of Noah's ark. He thought it really happened and had no problem with 
  the idea of God drowning everything and everybody. <a href="17.html#26">17:26-27</a>

<p><li>Jesus also believes the story about Sodom's destruction. He says, &quot;even thus shall it be in
the day the son of man is revealed.&quot; This tells us
about Jesus' knowledge of science and history. <a href="17.html#29">17:29-32</a>

<p><li> Jesus heals a blind man. <a href="18.html#35">18:35-43</a>

<p><li>"And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars."  <a href="21.html#25">21:25</a>

<p><li>When Jesus was crucified, there was three hours of complete darkness "over all the earth." It is 
strange that there is no record of this extraordinary event outside of the gospels.
