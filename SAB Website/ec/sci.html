<p><li>"The sun also ariseth"<br>
Although this verse is interpreted figuratively today, it was taken literally by virtually all 
Christians until the Copernican revolution, and was used by the Church to condemn Galileo for 
teaching the heliocentric heresy. <a href="1.html#5">1:5</a>

<p><li>"The place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again."<br>
Good description of the water cycle. <a href="1.html#7">1:7</a></li></p>

<p><li>"He hath made every thing beautiful."<br>
Everything is beautiful in its own way. Parasitic worms, cancer cells, bubonic plague. You just have to look at it from God's eyes.
<a href="3.html#11">3:11</a>

<p><li>"No man can find out the work that God maketh."<br>
Science is impossible. We can learn nothing at all about the natural world. <a href="3.html#11">3:11</a>

<p><li>"That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?"<br>
    Who can find out? We can by using science! The earth, ocean, solar system, galaxy, and universe -- nothing is too deep or far away for 
    science to discover and explore. <a href="7.html#24">7:24</a>

<p><li>"Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work
    that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet
    he shall not find it; yea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet
    shall he not be able to find it."<br>
    Oh, I think science has done a pretty good job of finding things out over the last four centuries or so. <a href="8.html#16">8:16</a>
