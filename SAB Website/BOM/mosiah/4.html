which causeth such <span class="a">exceedingly</span> great joy in your souls, even so I would that ye should

your hearts should be filled with joy, and has caused that your mouths should be stopped that ye could not find 
utterance, so <span class="a">exceedingly</span> great was your joy. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>4:21</b>   And now, if God, who has created you, on whom you are dependent for your lives and for all that ye 
have and are, doth grant unto you whatsoever ye ask that is right, in faith, believing that ye shall receive, O then, 
how <span class="g">ye ought to impart of the substance that ye have one to another.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/good1.gif" >
<img src="../../images/pol.gif" > (4:21) <i>"Ye ought to impart of the substance that ye have one to another."</i>
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>4:22</b>   And if ye judge the man who putteth up his petition to you for your substance that he perish not, and 
condemn him, how much more just will be your condemnation for withholding your substance, which doth not belong to you 
but to God, to whom also your life belongeth; and yet ye put up no petition, nor repent of the thing which thou hast 
done. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>4:23</b>   I say unto you, wo be unto that man, for his substance shall perish with him; and now, I say these 
things unto those who are rich as pertaining to the things of this world. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>4:24</b>   And again, I say unto the poor, ye who have not and yet have sufficient, that ye remain from day to 
day; I mean all you who deny the beggar, because ye have not; I would that ye say in your hearts that: I give not 
because I have not, but if I had I would give. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>4:25</b>   And now, if ye say this in your hearts ye remain guiltless, otherwise ye are condemned; and your 
condemnation is just for ye covet that which ye have not received. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>4:26</b>   And now, for the sake of these things which I have spoken unto you -- that is, for the sake of 
retaining a remission of your sins from day to day, that ye may walk guiltless before God -- I would that ye should 
<span class="g">impart of your substance to the poor, every man according to that which he hath, such as feeding the hungry, clothing 
the naked, visiting the sick and administering to their relief</span>, both spiritually and temporally, according to their 
wants. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/good1.gif" >
<img src="../../images/pol.gif" > (4:26) <i>"Impart of your substance to the poor, every man according to that which he hath, such as feeding the hungry, 
clothing the naked, visiting the sick and administering to their relief."</i><br>
Help the poor, feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and care for the sick.</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>4:27</b>   And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should 
run faster than he has strength.  And again, it is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the 
prize; therefore, all things must be done in order. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>4:28</b>   And I would that ye should remember, that <span class="g">whosoever among you 
borroweth of his neighbor should return the thing that he borroweth</span>, according as he doth agree, or else thou shalt commit sin; and perhaps thou shalt cause 
thy neighbor to commit sin also. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/good1.gif" > (4:28) <i>"Whosoever among you borroweth of his neighbor should return the thing that he borroweth"</i><br>
Return what you borrow.
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>4:29</b>   And finally, I cannot tell you all the things whereby ye may commit sin; for there are divers ways and 
means, even so many that I cannot number them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>4:30</b>   But this much I can tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, 
and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith of what ye have heard concerning the 
coming of our Lord, even unto the end of your lives, ye must perish.  And now, O man, remember, and perish not. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
