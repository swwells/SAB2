<tr><td><b>18:26<a name="26"></a></b>   <span class="a">And now it came to pass</span> that when Jesus had spoken these 
words, he turned his eyes again upon the disciples whom he had chosen, and said unto them: <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b>18:27<a name="27"></a></b>   Behold verily, verily, I say unto you, I give unto you another commandment, and then 
I must go unto my Father that I may fulfil other commandments which he hath given me. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b>18:28<a name="28"></a></b>   And now behold, this is the commandment which I give unto you, that ye shall not 
suffer any one knowingly to partake of my flesh and blood unworthily, when ye shall minister it; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b>18:29<a name="29"></a></b>   For<span class="c"> whoso eateth and drinketh my flesh and blood unworthily eateth and drinketh 
damnation to his soul</span>; therefore if ye know that a man is unworthy to eat and drink of my flesh 
and blood ye shall forbid him. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b>18:30<a name="30"></a></b>   Nevertheless, ye shall not cast him out from among you, but ye shall minister unto 
him and shall pray for him unto the Father, in my name; and if it so be that he repenteth and is 
baptized in my name, then shall ye receive him, and shall minister unto him of my flesh and 
blood. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b>18:31<a name="31"></a></b>   But if he repent not he shall not be numbered among my people, that he may not 
destroy my people, for behold I know my sheep, and they are numbered. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b>18:32<a name="32"></a></b>   Nevertheless, ye shall not cast him out of your synagogues, or your places of 
worship, for unto such shall ye continue to minister; for ye know not but what they will return 
and repent, and come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I shall heal them; and ye shall be 
the means of bringing salvation unto them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b>18:33<a name="33"></a></b>   Therefore, keep these sayings which I have commanded you that ye come not under 
condemnation; for wo unto him whom the Father condemneth. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b>18:34<a name="34"></a></b>   And I give you these commandments because of the disputations which have been 
among you.  And blessed are ye if ye have no disputations among you. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b>18:35<a name="35"></a></b>   And now I go unto the Father, because i<span class="c">t is expedient that I should go unto the 
Father</span> for your sakes. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

sayings, he touched with his hand the disciples whom he had chosen, one by one, even until he 
had touched them all, and spake unto them as he touched them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b>18:37<a name="37"></a></b>   And the multitude heard not the words which he spake, therefore they did not bear 
record; but the disciples bare record that he gave them power to give the Holy Ghost.  And I will 
show unto you hereafter that this record is true. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b>18:38<a name="38"></a></b>   <span class="a">It came to pass</span> that when Jesus had touched them all, there 
came a cloud and overshadowed the multitude that they could not see Jesus. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b>18:39<a name="39"></a></b>   And while they were overshadowed he departed from them, and ascended into heaven.  
And the disciples saw and did bear record that he ascended again into heaven. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
