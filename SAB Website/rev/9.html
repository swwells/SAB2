<p><b>The fifth trumpet</b>: Another star falls; this star was given the key to a bottomless pit a bottomless pit, 
containing smoke and locusts that have the power of scorpions. 

<p>The locust/scorpions are told not to "hurt
the grass [How could they? All the grass was killed in <A
href="8.html#7">8:7</A>] ... but only those men which have not the seal of God
on their foreheads."  The scorpion-torture 
goes on for five months. (Since <a href="7.html#4" title="Rev.7:4">only 144,000 Israelites were marked on their foreheads</a>, 
everyone else will get the 5-month scorpion torture.) Those tormented will want to die,
but God won't let them. <br>
What the Bible says about <a href="../says_about/torture.html">torture</a> and 
<a href="../says_about/suicide.html">suicide</a>

<p>God's locust/scorpions will look like horses with human heads, women's hair, and lion's teeth.

<p>(9:1) <i>"The fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit."</i>

<p>(9:2) <i>"He opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke ... and the sun and the air were darkened."</i>

<p>(9:3) <i>"There came out of the smoke locusts ...  and unto them was given power, as the scorpions."</i>

<p>(9:4) <i>"It was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass ... neither any green thing ... but <b>only those men which have 
not the seal of God in their foreheads.</b>"</i>

<p>(9:5) <i>"<b>To them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: 
and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion."</b></i><b> </b>

<p>(9:6) <i>"<b>In those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it;</b> and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them."</i>

<p>(9:7) <i>"The shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, 
and their faces were as the faces of men."</i>

<p>(9:8) <i>"They had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions."</i>

<p>(9:9) <i>"They had breastplates ... of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots."</i>

<p>(9:10) <i>"They had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months."</i>

<p><b>Sixth trumpet</b>: Four angels with an army of 200 million, kill a third of the earth's population.

<p>(9:13-15) <i>"The sixth angel sounded, and ... <b>four angels were loosed</b>, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, 
and a month, and a year, for <b>to slay the third part of men.</b>"</i>

<p>(9:16) <i>"The army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand."</i> 

<p>(9:17) <i>"The heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone."</i>

<p>(9:18) <i>"<b>By these three was the third part of men killed</b>, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, 
which issued out of their mouths."</i>

<p>(9:19) <i>"Their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt."</i>

<p>(9:20) <i>"The rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not."</i>
