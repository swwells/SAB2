<p><li>These verses imply that Jesus is God, but this is denied elsewhere in the bible. It's also denied by the JWs, of
course. But how could Jesus be with God in the beginning, as this verse says, if, as the GB teaches, Jesus was created
by God? And how could Jesus be "a god" and yet be with God during the creation if God was speaking truthfully in
<a href="../dt/32.html#39">Dt.32:39</a> when he said, "there are no gods with me"?  <a href="1.html#1">1:1</a>, 
<a href="1.html#14">14</a>
<p><li>JWs deny the bodily resurrection of Jesus, saying instead that he was raised as a "spirit creature". If so, then what
was he talking about 2:19? What did he mean by "this temple"? See v.21  <a href="2.html#19">2:19-21</a>
<p><li>In this verse, by saying "before Abraham was, I am," Jesus claims to be God. Of course, the JWs try to change
the clear meaning of Jesus' words by having him say, "Before Abraham came into existence I have been." I suppose
this is supposed to mean that he was around as the Archangel Michael back then or something. The NWT translates
"ego eimi" as "I am" everywhere it occurs except in this verse.  <a href="8.html#58">8:58</a>
<p><li>JWs, like Jesus, are hated by the world and are not of the world. Thus they don't vote or take part in any human
organizations outside the Watchtower Society.  <a href="15.html#19">15:19</a>, <a href="17.html#14">17:14</a>
<p><li>The governing body of the Jehovah's Witnesses insist that Jesus died on a "torture stake," not on a cross.
Watchtower publications often show this with Jesus nailed to a vertical stake, with his hands over his head and a
single nail passing through his wrists. But if he was executed on a torture stake, then why did Thomas say "unless I
see in his hands the print of the nailS...."? Wouldn't there have been only one nail through his hands if he died on a
torture stake?  <a href="20.html#25">20:25</a>
<p><li>If Jesus (like the JWs) didn't believe himself to be God, then why didn't he correct Thomas when he said, "My
Lord and my God"? <a href="20.html#28">20:28</a>
