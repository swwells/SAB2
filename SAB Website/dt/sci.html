<p><li>"The people is greater and taller than we ... we have seen the sons of the Anakims there."
More giants in the promised land. <a href="1.html#28">1:28</a>

<p><li>It took the Israelites 40 years to travel from Egypt to Canaan, yet such a journey, even at that time, 
would have taken no more than a few weeks. <a href="2.html#7">2:7</a>, <a href="8.html#2">8:2</a>, 
<a href="29.html#5">29:5</a>

<p><li>"A land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time."</i>
(They must have been much more common back then.) <a href="2.html#10">2:10-11</a>, 
<a href="2.html#20">20-21</a>

<p><li>Og, the king of the giants, was a tall man, even by NBA standards. His bed measured 9 by 4 cubits (13.5 feet long and
6 feet wide). <a href="3.html#11">3:11</a>

<p><li>God promises to cast out seven nations including the Amorites, Canaanites, and the Jebusites. But he was unable to
fulfill his promise. These nations were "greater and mightier" than the Israelites, who according to 
<a href="../ex/12.html#37">Exodus 12:37</a> and <a href="../num/1.html#45">Numbers 1:45-46</a> already had numbered 
several million. So the region, according to the bible, must have had a population of
more than twenty million!  <a href="7.html#1">7:1</a>

<p><li>"A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims."<br>
    More giants! <a href="9.html#2">9:2</a>
    
<p><li>"When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone ... I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water."  <a href="9.html#9">9:9</a>


<p><li>This verse mistakenly says that the hare chews its cud. <a href="14.html#7">14:7-8</a>

<p><li>To the biblical God, a bat is just an another unclean bird.  <a href="14.html#11">14:11, 18</a>

<p><li>"And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the earth that is under thee shall 
be iron."  <a href="28.html#23">28:23</a>

<p><li>"The LORD shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust: from heaven shall it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed." 
<a href="28.html#24">28:24</a>

<p><li>"An eagle ... beareth them on her wings."<br>
Do eagles carry their young on their wings? I know of no evidence (except for the single anecdote 
provided <a href="http://www.asa3.org/asa/PSCF/1968/JASA3-68Howe.html">here</a>) that they do.  
<a href="32.html#11">32:11</a>

<p><li> "Their wine is the poison of dragons." I wonder what genus and species the bible is referring to when it mentions
dragons.  <a href="32.html#33">32:33</a>

<p><li>Joseph's "horns are like the horns of a unicorn." <a href="33.html#17">33:17</a>
