<p><li>Those who bear bad fruit will be cut down and burned "with unquenchable fire."  <a href="3.html#10">3:10, 12</a>

<p><li>Jesus strongly approves of the law and the prophets. He hasn't the slightest objection to the cruelties of the Old
Testament.  <a href="5.html#17">5:17</a>

<p><li>Jesus recommends that to avoid sin we cut off our hands and pluck out our eyes. This advice 
is given immediately after he says that anyone who looks with lust at any women commits 
adultery.  <a href="5.html#29">5:29-30</a>

<p><li>Jesus says that most people will go to hell. <a href="7.html#13">7:13-14</a>

<p><li>Those who fail to bear "good fruit" will be "hewn down, and cast into the fire." <a href="7.html#19">7:19</a>

<p><li>"The children of the kingdom [the Jews] shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall 
be weeping and gnashing of teeth." <a href="8.html#12">8:12</a>

<p><li>Jesus sends some devils into a herd of pigs, causing them to run off a cliff and drown in the waters 
below. <a href="8.html#32">8:32</a>

<p><li>Cities that neither &quot;receive&quot;
the disciples nor &quot;hear&quot; their words will be destroyed by God. It will
be worse for them than for Sodom and Gomorrah. And you know what God supposedly
did to those poor folks (see <A href="../gen/19.html#24">Gen.19:24</A>).
 <a href="10.html#14">10:14-15</a>
 
<p><li>Families will be torn apart because of Jesus (this is one of the few "prophecies" in 
the Bible that has actually come
true). "Brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the 
children shall rise up against their parents,
and cause them to be put to death."  <a href="10.html#21">10:21</a>

<p><li>Jesus says that we should fear God who is willing and "able to destroy both soul and body in hell." 
 <a href="10.html#28">10:28</a>
 
 <p><li>Jesus says that he has come to destroy families by making family members hate each other. He has "come not to
send peace, but a sword."  <a href="10.html#34">10:34-36</a>

<p><li>Jesus condemns entire cities to dreadful deaths and to the eternal torment of hell because they didn't care for his
preaching.  <a href="11.html#20">11:20-24</a>

<p><li>Jesus will send his angels to gather up "all that offend" and they "shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there
shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth."  <a href="13.html#41">13:41-42, 50</a>

<p><li>Jesus is criticized by the Pharisees for not
washing his hands before eating. He defends himself by attacking them for not
killing disobedient children according to the commandment: &quot;He that curseth
father or mother, let him die the death.&quot; (See <A href="../ex/21.html#15">Ex.21:15</A>,
<A href="../lev/20.html#9">Lev.20:9</A>, <A href="../dt/21.html#18">Dt.21:18-21</A>) 
So, does Jesus think that children who curse their parents should be killed? It 
sure sounds like it. <a href="15.html#4">15:4-7</a>

<p><li>Jesus advises his followers to mutilate themselves by cutting off their hands and plucking out their eyes. He says it's
better to be "maimed" than to suffer "everlasting fire." <a href="18.html#8">18:8-9</a>

<p><li>"And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors." <a href="18.html#34">18:34</a>

<p><li>In the parable of the marriage feast, the king sends his servants to gather everyone they can find, both bad and
good, to come to the wedding feast. One guest didn't have on his wedding garment, so the king tied him up and "cast him
into the outer darkness" where "there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth." 
<a href="22.html#12">22:12-13</a>

<p><li>Jesus had no problem with the idea of drowning everyone on earth in the flood. It'll be just like that when he 
returns. <a href="24.html#37">24:37</a>

<p><li>God will come when people least expect him and then he'll "cut them asunder." And "there shall be weeping and
gnashing of teeth."  <a href="24.html#50">24:50-51</a>

<p><li>The servant who kept and returned his master's talent was cast into the "outer darkness" where there will be
"weeping and gnashing of teeth."  <a href="25.html#30">25:30</a>

<p><li>Jesus tells us what he has planned for those that he dislikes. They will be cast into an "everlasting fire." 
 <a href="25.html#41">25:41</a>
 
<p><li>Jesus says the damned will be tormented forever.  <a href="25.html#46">25:46</a>
