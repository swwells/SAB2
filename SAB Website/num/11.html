The people begin to whine about not having any meat. So God says he'll 
give them meat, alright. He'll give them "flesh to eat," not for just a few days, but "for a whole 
month, until it come out of [their] nostrils, and it be loathsome to [them]." Yuck.

God sent quails to feed his

the earth.&quot; Taking the &quot;face of the earth&quot; to be a circle with a
radius of say 30 kilometers (an approximate day's journey), this would amount to
3 trillion (3x10<SUP>12</SUP>) liters of quails. At 2 quails per liter, this
would provide a couple million quails for each of several million people.
