    <p><li> More lewdness and whoredom. <a href="6.html#9">6:9-10</a>
    
    <p><li>"I will send a fire upon his cities." <a href="8.html#14">8:14</a>
    
    <p><li>"Thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor." <a href="9.html#1">9:1</a>
    
    <p><li>"The prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is mad." <a href="9.html#7">9:7</a>
    
    <p><li>"Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them." <a href="9.html#12">9:12</a>
    
  <p><li>"O Lord: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts." <A href="9.html#14" >9:14</A>
  
  <p><li>"Yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb." <A href="9.html#16" >9:16</A>
  
  <p><li>God will punish Israel by "dashing" together mothers and their children. <a href="10.html#14">10:14</a> 
  
  <p><li>"The LORD ... shall roar like a lion." <a href="11.html#10">11:10</a>
  
  <p><li>God will rip humans apart and eat them like a lion. <A href="13.html#7" >13:7-8</A>
  
  <p><li>"Their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up." <A href="13.html#16">13:16</A>
