sons go a whoring after their gods." <a href="../ex/34.html#15">34:15-16</a>

<p><b><a href="../lev/lang_list.html">Leviticus</a></b>

<p><li>Long, tiresome, and disgusting instructions regarding the treatment of men who have a
"running issue" out of their "flesh." Very enlightening. "And if he that hath the issue spit upon him
that is clean ..."  <a href="../lev/15.html#1">15:1-15</a>

<p><li>"If any man's seed of copulation go out from him...." (God's law for wet dreams)<br>
This passage tells you what to do if you get your "seed of copulation" on yourself,
your clothes, or your partner. Thank God this is in the Bible.  
<a href="../lev/15.html#16">15:16-18</a>, <a href="../lev/15.html#32">32</a>

<p><li>"If any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he shall ... be unclean until the even." <a href="../lev/15.html#16">15:16</a>

<p><li>"And every garment ... whereon is the seed of copulation, shall be ... unclean until the even."  <a href="../lev/15.html#17">15:17</a>

<p><li>"The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water, 
and be unclean until the even." <a href="../lev/15.html#18">15:18</a>

<p><li>Don't "uncover the nakedness" of any of your relatives or neighbors. Just ask them
to keep their clothes on while you are around.  <a href="../lev/18.html#6">18:6-18, 20</a>
<p><li>"Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is
apart for her uncleanness," Don't even look at a menstruating woman. 
 <a href="../lev/18.html#19">18:19</a>
<p><li>Don't "lie with any beast." You probably weren't planning on doing this, but now 
you know just in case you get the urge sometime.  <a href="../lev/18.html#23">18:23</a>
<p><li>If you upset God, he'll cause the land to vomit you out. 
 <a href="../lev/18.html#25">18:25</a>
<p><li>Don't "go a whoring" after Molech or "commit adultery with him." (Don't you love it
when God talks dirty?)  <a href="../lev/20.html#5">20:5</a>
<p><li>Stay away from people with familiar spirits and don't "go a whoring" 
after them either. <a href="../lev/20.html#6">20:6</a>
<p><li>A man with damaged testicles must not "come nigh to offer the bread of his God." 
 <a href="../lev/21.html#20">21:20</a>
 <p><li>A man who   has a "running issue" or "whose seed goeth from
him" ... "shall not eat of the holy things, until he be

So if you plan to attend church next Sunday be ready to prove that your genitals are intact and don't forget your birth
certificate and genealogical records for at least the last ten generations. Don't laugh. This stuff is important to God. 
 <a href="../dt/23.html#2">23:2</a>
<p><li>God gives us instructions for defecating. He says to carefully cover up all feces "for the Lord walketh in the midst
of thy camp." (You wouldn't want the divine foot to step in your shit, would you?)  <a href="../dt/23.html#12">23:12-14</a>
<p><li>God says not be bring any whore, sodomite, or dog into the house of the Lord. For "these things are an abomination

was legendary, and he probably didn't practice safe sex.  <a href="../ps/38.html#5">38:5, 7</a>

<p><li>They [the heathen] make a noise like a dog .... Behold, they belch out with their mouths." These are good
reasons for God to kill them.  <a href="../ps/59.html#6">59:6-7, 14</a>

<p><li>God divides the world into those countries that he likes and those that he doesn't. 
Those he doesn't like he calls names (like "washpot") and says that he will throw his sandal on them.
<a href="../ps/60.html#7">60:7-8</a>

<p><li>God will "wound the head of his enemies" so that the righteous can wash their feet "in the blood 
of thine enemies, and the tongue of thy dogs in the same."  <a href="../ps/68.html#21">68:21, 23</a>

<p><li>The psalmist prays that his enemies be tormented and blinded by God. He asks God to "make their loins
continually to shake."  <a href="../ps/69.html#23">69:23-28</a>

<p><li>"They that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee." <a href="../ps/73.html#27">73:27</a>

<p><li>The psalmist asks God to " do unto them as unto the Midianites ... which became as dung for the earth." 
 <a href="../ps/83.html#9">83:9-18</a>

<p><li> Jeremiah's big on calling people and places "whores" and "harlots." <a href="../jer/2.html#20">2:20</a>

<p><li> God compares Jerusalem's sinful ways to a promiscuous woman, or a wild donkey in heat.  
<a href="../jer/2.html#24">2:24</a>

<p><li>"Thou hast played the harlot with many lovers." <a href="../jer/3.html#1">3:1</a>

<p><li> &quot;In the ways thou hast sat for them ...&quot; A woman can't even sit anymore without being 
condemned by God.  <a href="../jer/3.html#2">3:2</a>

<p><li> Jeremiah loves to insult people. His favorite insult is to call someone a whore. In this verse he 
accuses Jedah of having a &quot;whore's forehead.&quot; <a href="../jer/3.html#3">3:3</a>

<p><li> More talk of harlots who have sex under every tree. <a href="../jer/3.html#6">3:6</a>

<p><li>Judah commits adultery with &quot;stocks and stones.&quot; <a href="../jer/3.html#9">3:9</a>
 
<p><li>Jeremiah just can't quit talking about sex under the trees. <a href="../jer/3.html#13">3:13</a>

<p><li> &quot;Circumcise the foreskins of your heart.&quot;&nbsp; <a href="../jer/4.html#4">4:4</a>

<p><li> &quot;As fed horses in the morning: everyone neighed after his neighbor's wife.&quot; 
<a href="../jer/5.html#8">5:8</a>

<p><li> &quot;Behold, their ear is uncircumcised.&quot;  <a href="../jer/6.html#10">6:10</a>

<p><li> God will cover the earth with dead bodies that
will not be buried. &quot;They shall be for dung upon the face of the
earth.&quot; <a href="../jer/8.html#2">8:2</a>

<p><li>Don't just circumcise your penis. Circumcise you heart as well. <a href="../jer/9.html#26">9:26</a>

<p><li> God compares the destruction of Jerusalem to the rape of a woman who deserves to be raped because 
she has sinned. <a href="../jer/13.html#22">13:22</a>

<p><li>God plans to expose Jerusalem's private parts to the world by lifting her skirt over her head, so to speak. He's seen
her commit whoredoms and abominations and whatnot on the hills, and he's getting darned sick of it! 
<a href="../jer/13.html#26">13:26-27</a>

and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you." <a href="../jer/25.html#27">27:27</a>

<p><li> God will kill so many people that the entire earth will be covered with their dead bodies. No one is to 
mourn them or even bury them; &quot;they shall be dung upon the ground.&quot; 
<a href="../jer/16.html#4">16:4</a>, <a href="../jer/25.html#31">25:31-33</a>

<p><b><a href="../lam/lang_list.html">Lamentations</a></b>

<p><li> Jerusalem is compared to a naked woman who sighs and turns backward. &quot;Her filthiness is

<p><li> The adversary puts his hand upon &quot;all her pleasant things. <a href="../lam/1.html#10">1:10</a>
<p><li> &quot;Jerusalem is as a menstrous woman.&quot; To God this is an insult. <a href="../lam/1.html#17">1:17</a>

<p><li>God dresses up Jerusalem, cleans off the blood that  she was wallowing in, and compliments 
her on her nice hair and breasts.  <a href="../ezek/16.html#6">16:6-7, 22</a>

<p><li>Jerusalem was a harlot who had sex with everyone that passed by. <a href="../ezek/16.html#15">16:15-16</a>

<p><li>"Thou hast ... madest to thyself images of men, and didst commit whoredom with

<p><li>"Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, great of flesh." (Jerusalem 
had sex with Egyptians with big penises.) <a href="../ezek/16.html#26">16:26</a>

<p><li>Jerusalem still wasn't satisfied after having sex with the 
<span lang="en-us"></span>well-endowed Egyptians 
(<a href="#26">v.26</a>), so she had sex with the Assyrians too. Yet she still wasn't satisfied. 
So she had sex with the men of Canaan and Chaldea, but still was not satisfied.

<p><li>God calls Jerusalem "an imperious whorish woman." <a href="../ezek/16.html#30">16:30</a>

<p><li>God says that Jerusalem has sex with strangers, hiring them to "come in unto thee on every side."
<a href="../ezek/16.html#32">16:32-33</a>

<p><li>Because she is such a filthy harlot, God will expose her nakedness 
before all of her lovers. <a href="../ezek/16.html#35">16:35-36</a>

<p><li>After exposing her nakedness, God will give her "blood in fury and jealousy" and strip her naked once 
more. <a href="../ezek/16.html#38">16:38-41</a>

<p><li>Information from God about discovering the nakedness

<p><li>"I will consume thy filthiness out of thee." <a href="../ezek/22.html#15">22:15</a>

<p><li> Two sisters were guilty of &quot;committing whoredoms&quot; by pressing their breasts and 
bruising &quot;the teats of their virginity.&quot; As a punishment, one sister's nakedness was 
discovered, her children were taken from her, and she was killed by the sword. And the fate of the 
surviving sister was even worse: Her nose and ears were cut off, she was made to &quot;pluck off&quot; 
her own breasts, and then after being raped and mutilated, she is stoned to death. 
<a href="../ezek/23.html#1">23:1-49</a>

<p><li>"Their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity." <a href="../ezek/23.html#3">23:3</a>

<p><li>"Thus she committed her whoredoms with them ... with all their idols she defiled herself." <a href="../ezek/23.html#7">23:7</a>

<p><li>"They bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her." <a href="../ezek/23.html#8">23:8</a>

<p><li>"And the Babylonians came
    to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom,
    and she was polluted with them." <a href="../ezek/23.html#17">23:17</a>
    
<p><li>"So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness ... she multiplied her whoredoms." <a href="../ezek/23.html#18">23:18-19</a>

<p><li>Really Big Penises. One of the sister (Aholibah) had lovers
&quot;whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.&quot;
<a href="../ezek/23.html#20">23:20</a>

<p><li>"The lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth." <a href="../ezek/23.html#21">23:21</a>

<p><li>"Thou shalt ... pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD." <a href="../ezek/23.html#34">23:34</a>

saying &quot;kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be 
burned." <a href="../ezek/24.html#3">24:3-14</a>
<p><li>  God makes &quot;all their loins to be at a stand.&quot; When this is achieved, God will get out his sword and &quot;cut off man and beast out of thee.&quot; Ouch!  <a href="../ezek/29.html#7">29:7-9</a>
