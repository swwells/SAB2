<p><li>The people asked John the Baptist what they need to do to avoid hell. He told them to give their excess 
 food and clothes to the poor. <a href="3.html#10">3:10-11</a>

<p><li>Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely. <a href="3.html#14">3:14</a>

<p><li>Love you enemies; do good to those who hate you.  <a href="6.html#27">6:27</a>

<p><li>The Golden Rule: Treat others as you would like to be treated. <a href="6.html#31">6:31-34</a>

<p><li>"Love your enemies." Well, it's a nice thought. But it seems strange coming from someone who damns his
enemies to hell. (<a href="../mk/16.html#16">Mark 16:16</a>)  <a href="6.html#35">6:35</a>

<p><li> "Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful." Well I'm glad Jesus thinks we should be merciful.
But the Old Testament God is a strange role model for mercy! (See <a href="../1sam/15.html#2">1 Sam 15:2-3</a> for an 
example of the OT God's mercy.)  <a href="6.html#36">6:36</a>

<p><li>"Judge not ... condemn not ... forgive." <a href="6.html#37">6:37</a>

<p><li>Love thy neighbor as thyself. <a href="10.html#27">10:27</a>

<p><li>The story of the good Samaritan gets my vote for the best bible story. We should all "go and do likewise." 
 <a href="10.html#30">10:30-37</a>
 
   <p><li>"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's."<br>
     Pay your taxes. Keep state and church separate. <a href="20.html#25">20:25</a>

<p><li>From his comments on the widow's mites, it appears that Jesus favored progressive taxation.  <a href="21.html#1">21:1-3</a>
