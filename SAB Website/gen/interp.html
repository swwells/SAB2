<p><li>"And God made the beast of the earth." <br>
The Christian Identity and Aryan Nations folks say that "beast of the earth" and "beast of the 
field" refer to all non-human animals and non-white humans. They consider all people of color to be 
without a soul and on the same level as animals, such as cattle, fish, and birds. <a href="1.html#25">1:25</a>
 
<p><li>God gave humans dominion over every other living thing on earth. 
This couldn't be true, of course, since millions of other species existed for 
millions of years before humans existed. But this verse is used by 
fundamentalist Christians to justify their mistreatment of other species and 
disregard for the environment. After all, they believe that God created the 
other species just for them, so they can do whatever they please with them.  <a href="1.html#26">1:26</a>

<p><li>One way of dealing with <a href="../contra/accounts.html">the two contradictory creation 
accounts</a> is to say that the reason there are two different stories is that there were two different 
creations. This has been a common interpretation historically, and it is still found taday.

<p><li>"Be fruitful and multiply." <br>
This verse is used to justify Christian
opposition to birth control, concern for the environment, and animal rights. The earth was made for humans, and they 
can do as they damn well please with it. <a href="1.html#28">1:28</a>

<p><li>In Christian Identity theology, the serpent is a black male ("beast of the field"), possessed 
by the devil, who seduced Eve. Cain is the child that is born from this union, the evil son of 
the devil and the first Jew. All Jews are descended from Cain. <a href="3.html#1">3:1</a>

<p><li>"And Cain knew his wife." That's
nice, but where the hell did she come from? 

<p>Although the Bible doesn't say, Joseph Smith provided the answer 
in "<a href="http://www.centerplace.org/hs/iv/iv-gen.htm">The Inspired 
Version</a>" of the Bible, which was his very own "translation". Here's what it says:

<blockquote>
And it came to pass, that Cain took one of his brother's daughters to wife, and they loved Satan more than 
God. – Gen.5:13</blockquote>

<p>So according to Joseph Smith (and he ought to know!) Cain married one
of his nieces. He doesn't say, though, which of Cain's brothers was Mrs. Cain's father.

<p><li>The flood story in Genesis is confusing to read. The clean animals go into the ark by twos (<a href="6.html#19">6:19-20</a>, 
<a href="7.html#8">7:8-9</a>) 
and by sevens (<a href="7.html#2">7:2</a>). The flood lasts for forty days (<a href="7.html#17">7:17</a>)  
and for 150 days (<a href="7.html#24">7:24</a>, <a href="8.html#3">8:3</a>). Noah sends out a raven 
(<a href="8.html#7">8:7</a>) and a dove (<a href="8.html#8">8:8</a>). <br>
Why doesn't Genesis get its story straight? Because there were two separate accounts that were (somewhat clumsily) 
interwoven. <a href="8.html#7">8:7</a>

<p><li>"And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger 
son had done unto him."<br>
What did Ham do? Did he just look at his naked father or was there something more to it than that? 
  Some commentators have suggested that Ham committed homosexual rape on his drunken father, and that 
  this was why Ham's descendants were eternally punished with slavery. <a href="9.html#24">9:24</a>

<a href="10.html#8">10:8-10</a>

<p><li>"Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided." <br>
Some creationists believe that this verse refers to continental drift, which, they say,
began to occur during the days of Pelag (which means "division"), about 100 or so years after the flood. But many 
other creationists <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/peleg.html">disagree</a>. <a href="10.html#25">10:25</a>

<p><li>"Terah ... begat Abraham."<br>

<p><li>Say, I pray thee, thouart my sister."<br>
In the LDS <a href="../pearl/abraham/2.html#">Book of Abraham</a> the same silly story is told, but it is God, not Abraham, who concocts the lie.

sexual nature, noting that the same word is used to describe the behaviour of
