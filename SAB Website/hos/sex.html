<BODY>
<p><li> God (or Hosea?) tells his children that their mother is a whore who is not his wife. He asks 
them to tell their mother to "put away her whoredoms" and  "her adulteries from between her breasts" or 
he'll "strip her naked ... and slay her with thirst." <a href="2.html#2">2:2-3</a>

<p><li>God says he &quot;will discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers.&quot; <a href="2.html#10">2:10</a>

<p><li>God tells Hosea to love an adulteress. (I thought he already did that in chapter 1.) In any case, Hosea buys (another?) one 
for a homer and a half of barley.  <a href="3.html#1">3:1-2</a>

<p><li>Even more whoredom! "They have committed whoredom continually." <a href="4.html#14">4:14-18</a>

<p><li> Israel has &quot;gone a whoring&quot; and has &quot;loved a reward upon every cornfloor.&quot; <a href="9.html#1">9:1</a>
