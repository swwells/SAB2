"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",
"<span class='i'>Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever.</span>--<a href='3.html#14'>Alma 3:14</a>",
"<span class='i'>I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</span>--<a href='3.html#15'>Alma 3:15</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",
"<span class='a'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges ... even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year....</span>--<a href='16.html#1'>Alma 16:1</a>",
"<span class='a'>Their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.</span>--<a href='16.html#11'>Alma 16:11</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.   Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</span>--<a href='30.html#22'>Alma 30:22</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",
"<span class='i'>God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.</span>--<a href='30.html#47'>Alma 30:47</a>",
"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",

"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",
"<span class='i'>These dissenters ... became ... more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='47.html#36'>Alma 47:36</a>",

"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",
"<span class='i'>The remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty.</span>--<a href='51.html#20'>Alma 51:20</a>",

perceive that thy mind is worried concerning the resurrection of the dead. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>40:2</b>   Behold, I say unto you, that there is no resurrection -- or, I would say, in other words, that 
<span class="plag">this mortal does not put on immortality, this corruption does not put on incorruption</span> -- until after the coming 
of Christ. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">

For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on  immortality.

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>40:3</b>   Behold, he bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead.  But behold, my son, the resurrection 
is not yet.  Now, I unfold unto you a mystery; nevertheless, there are many mysteries which are kept, that no one 
knoweth them save God himself.  But I show unto you one thing which I have inquired diligently of God that I
 might know -- that is concerning the resurrection. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>40:4</b>   Behold, there is a time appointed that all shall come forth from the dead.  Now when this time 
 cometh no one knows; but God knoweth the time which is appointed. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>40:5</b>   Now, whether there shall be one time, or a second time, or a third time, that men shall come 
 forth from the dead, it mattereth not; for God knoweth all these things; and it sufficeth me to know that this 
 is the case -- that there is a time appointed that all shall rise from the dead. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>40:6</b>   Now there must needs be a space betwixt the time of death and the time of the resurrection. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>40:7</b>   And now I would inquire what becometh of the souls of men from this time of death to the time 
 appointed for the resurrection? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>40:8</b>   Now whether there is more than one time appointed for men to rise it mattereth not; for all do 
 not die at once, and this mattereth not; all is as one day with God, and time only is measured unto men. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>40:9</b>   Therefore, there is a time appointed unto men that they shall rise from the dead; and there is a 
 space between the time of death and the resurrection.  And now, concerning this space of time, what becometh of 
 the souls of men is the thing which I have inquired diligently of the Lord to know; and this is the thing of 
 which I do know. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>40:10</b>   And when the time cometh when all shall rise, then shall they know that God knoweth all the 
 times which are appointed unto man. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>40:11</b>   Now, concerning the state of the soul between death and the resurrection -- Behold, it has 
 been made known unto me by an angel, that the spirits of all men, as soon as they are departed from this mortal 
 body, yea, the spirits of all men, whether they be good or evil, are taken home to that God who gave them life. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>40:12</b>   <span class="a">And then shall it come to pass</span>, that the spirits of those who are righteous are received into a 
 state of happiness, which is called paradise, a state of rest, a state of peace, where they shall rest from all 
 their troubles and from all care, and sorrow. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

 <tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>40:13</b>   <span class="a">And then shall it come to pass</span>, that <span class="i">the spirits of the 
 wicked, yea, who are evil -- for behold, 
 they have no part nor portion of the Spirit of the Lord</span>; for behold, they chose evil works rather than good; 
 </span>therefore the spirit of the devil did enter into them, and take possession of their house -- and these 
 shall be <span class="plag">cast out into outer darkness; there shall be weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth</span>, 
 and this because of their own iniquity, being led captive by the will of the devil. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Evil people are those who "have no part or portion of the Spirit of the Lord." They will be

 <tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>40:14</b>   Now this is the state of the souls of the wicked, yea, in darkness, and a state 
 of awful,  <span class="plag">fearful looking for the fiery indignation</span> of the wrath of God upon them; thus they remain in this state, as 
 well as the righteous in paradise, until the time of their resurrection. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

 <tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>40:15</b>   Now, there are some that have understood that this state of happiness and this state of 
 misery of the soul, before the resurrection, was a first resurrection.  Yea, I admit it may be termed a 
 resurrection, the raising of the spirit or the soul and their consignation to happiness or misery, according 
 to the words which have been spoken. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>40:16</b>   And behold, again it hath been spoken, that there is a first resurrection, a resurrection 
 of all those who have been, or who are, or who shall be, down to the resurrection of Christ from the dead. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>40:17</b>   Now, we do not suppose that this first resurrection, which is spoken of in this manner, can be 
 the resurrection of the souls and their consignation to happiness or misery.  Ye cannot suppose that this is what 
 it meaneth. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>40:18</b>   Behold, I say unto you, Nay; but it meaneth the reuniting of the soul with the 
 body, of those from the days of Adam down to the resurrection of Christ. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>40:19</b>   Now, whether the souls and the bodies of those of whom has been spoken shall all be reunited at 
 once, the wicked as well as the righteous, I do not say; let it suffice; that I say that they all come forth; or 
 in other words, their resurrection cometh to pass before the resurrection of those who die after the 
 resurrection of Christ. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>40:20</b>   Now, my son, I do not say that their resurrection cometh at the resurrection of Christ; but 
 behold, I give it as my opinion, that the souls and the bodies are reunited, of the righteous, at the 
 resurrection of Christ, and his ascension into heaven. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>40:21</b>   But whether it be at his resurrection or after, I do not say; but this much I say, that there 
 is a space between death and the resurrection of the body, and a state of the soul in happiness or in misery 
 until the time which is appointed of God that the dead shall come forth, and be reunited, both soul and body, 
 and be brought to stand before God, and be judged according to their works. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>40:22</b>   Yea, this bringeth about the restoration of those things of which has been spoken by the 
 mouths of the prophets. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>40:23</b>   The soul shall be restored to the body, and the body to the 
 soul; yea, and every limb and joint shall be restored to its body; yea, even a hair of the head shall not be lost; 
 but all things shall be restored to their proper and perfect frame. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>40:24</b>   And now, my son, this is the restoration of which has been spoken by the mouths of the 
 prophets --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>40:25</b>   And <span class="plag">then shall the righteous shine forth</span> in the kingdom of God.

Then shall the righteous shine forth -- <a href="../../mt/13.html#43">Matthew 13:43</a>
</font>

 <tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>40:26</b>   But behold, an awful death cometh upon the wicked; for they die as to things pertaining to things 
 of righteousness; for they are unclean, and no unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of God; but they are cast out, 
 and consigned to partake of the fruits of their labors or their works, which have been evil; and they drink the 
 dregs of a bitter cup. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
