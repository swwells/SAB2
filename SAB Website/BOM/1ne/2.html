<a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a> (2:1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 14, 16, 17, 19)

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (2:1-4)

<p>(2:1-2) God speaks to Lehi in a dream and tells him to leave 
Jerusalem and go "into the wilderness." 

<p><i>"The Lord commanded my father, even in a dream, that he should take his family and depart into the wilderness."</i>

<p>(2:4) So, with no further instructions, he and his family 
go into the wild. (Lehi's family included his wife Sariah, and four sons, Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi.) 

<p><i>"He departed into the wilderness ...  with ... his family."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif">
<img src="../../images/sci1.gif" > (2:5-6) The 400+ km hike from Jerusalem to the Red Sea took only 
three days.  

<p><i>"He came down by ... the Red Sea ... when he had traveled three days ... he pitched his tent in a valley by ... a river."</i>
 
<p><img src="../../images/sci1.gif" >(2:8-9)
Lehi named the river after his slacker son, Laman, hoping it would inspire him to be more dependable, like the "continually running" river. 
 But <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea">there are no 
permanent rivers that flow into the Red Sea</a> and there is no evidence that such rivers existed in 600 BCE.<br>
<a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=AxH3OVoJZcA">Where is the River Laman?</a> 

<p>(2:8) <i>"He called the name of the river, Laman, and it emptied into the Red Sea."</i>

<p>(2:9) <i>"My father ... spake unto Laman, saying: O that thou mightest be like unto this river, continually running."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" >(2:10) Lehi named the valley after his other worthless son, 
Lemuel, hoping it would make him more steadfast and immovable.  

<p><i>"And he also spake unto Lemuel: O that thou mightest be like unto this valley, firm and steadfast, and immovable!"</i>

<p><img src="../../images/int.gif"> (2:11-13) But the magic didn't work. Laman and Lemuel were 
so evil they were "like unto the Jews." (Being like a Jew is about as bad as it gets in the Book of Mormon.)

<p><i>"This he spake because of ... Laman and Lemuel ... They were like unto the Jews.</i>

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif"> (2:16)
the mysteries of God -- <a href="../../1cor/4.html#1">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (2:16) <a href="exceed_list.html">Exceedingly</a>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (2:16-18)

<p>(2:16) Nephi wanted to know the mysteries of God, so he 
cried unto the Lord. And the Lord softened his heart (and his brain) so he could believe the shit his dad said.

<p><i>"I did cry unto the Lord and behold he ... did soften my heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my father."</i>

<p>(2:17) And the dumb-as-shit Sam went along with whatever Nephi said. 

<p><i>"I spake unto Sam ... And it came to pass that he believed in my words."</i>

<p>(2:18) But Laman and Lemuel wouldn't listen to Nephi because 
they suffered from Pharaoh's syndrome: the hardening of the heart. 

<p><i>"But, behold, Laman and Lemuel would not hearken unto my words ... because of the hardness of their hearts."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif" border="0"> (2:18) Being grieved for the hardness of their hearts 
-- <a href="../../mk/3.html#5">Mark 3:5</a>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" border="0"> (2:19-20) God told Nephi that he would lead him to a new land, 
a land that God had prepared just for him (and the Mormons) that was better than everywhere else on earth. (God made the New World just 
for Nephi and his family. For though it had been occupied by the Native Americans for 15,000 years or so, God made it for Nephi, 
not for them.)

<p><i>"Blessed art thou, Nephi ... Ye shall prosper, and shall be led to ... a land which I have prepared for you; yea, a land which 
is choice above all other lands."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/int.gif" border="0"> (2:21-23) But God will curse Nephi's brothers.

<p><i>"Thy brethren shall rebel against thee ... I will curse them even with a sore curse."</i>

this people the things which I commanded thee, behold, they seek to take away thy life.

Sariah, and my elder brothers, who were Laman, Lemuel, and Sam.

<tr><td><b><a name="9">2:9</b></a> And when <span class="sci">my father</span> saw that the waters of the river emptied into the 
fountain of the Red Sea, he <span class="sci">spake

<tr><td><b><a name="11">2:11</b></a>   Now <span class="int">this he spake because of</span> the stiffneckedness of <span class="int">Laman and Lemuel</span>; for behold they did murmur in 
many things against their father, because he was a visionary man, and had led them out of the land of Jerusalem, to 
leave the land of their inheritance, and their gold, and their silver, and their precious things, to perish in the 
wilderness.  And this they said he had done because of the foolish imaginations of his heart. 

<tr><td><b><a name="12">2:12</b></a>   And thus Laman and Lemuel, being the eldest, did murmur against their father.  And they did murmur 
because they knew not the dealings of that God who had created them. 

<tr><td><b><a name="13">2:13</b></a>   Neither did they believe that Jerusalem, that great city, could be destroyed according to the words 
of the prophets.  And they <span class="int">were like unto the Jews</span> who were at Jerusalem, who sought to take away the life of my 
father. 

<tr><td><b><a name="14">2:14</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that my father did speak unto them in the valley of Lemuel, 
with power, being filled with the Spirit, until their frames did shake before him.  And he did confound them, that 
they durst not utter against him; wherefore, they did as he commanded them. 

<tr><td><b><a name="15">2:15</b></a>   And my father dwelt in a tent. 

<tr><td><b><a name="16">2:16</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that I, Nephi, being <span class="a">exceedingly</span> 
young, nevertheless being large in stature, and also having great desires to know of<span class="plag"> the mysteries of God,</span> 
wherefore, <span class="a">I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my heart that I did believe all the words which had 
been spoken by my father</span>; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto my brothers. 

<tr><td><b><a name="17">2:17</b></a>   And <span class="a">I spake unto Sam</span>, making known unto him the things which the Lord had manifested unto me by his 
Holy Spirit.  <span class="a">And it came to pass that he believed in my words. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="18">2:18</b></a>   But, behold, Laman and Lemuel would not hearken unto my 
words; and <span class="plag">being grieved because of the hardness 
of their hearts</span> I cried unto the Lord for them. 

<tr><td><b><a name="19">2:19</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Lord spake unto me, saying: 
<span class="a">Blessed art thou, Nephi</span>, because of thy faith, for thou hast sought me diligently, with lowliness of heart. 

<tr><td><b><a name="20">2:20</b></a>   And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, <span class="a">ye shall 
prosper, and shall be led to</span> a land of promise; yea, even <span class="a">a land which I have prepared for you; yea, a land 
which is choice above all other lands. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="21">2:21</b></a>   And inasmuch as <span class="int">thy brethren shall rebel against thee</span>, they shall be cut 
off from the presence of the Lord. 

<tr><td><b><a name="22">2:22</b></a>   And inasmuch as thou shalt keep my commandments, thou shalt be made a ruler and a teacher over thy 
brethren. 

<tr><td><b><a name="23">2:23</b></a>   For behold, in that day that they shall rebel against me, <span class="int">I will curse them 
even with a sore curse</span>, and they shall have no power over thy seed except they shall rebel against me also. 

<tr><td><b><a name="24">2:24</b></a>   And if it so be that they rebel against me, they shall 
be a scourge unto thy seed, <span class="plag">to stir them up in 
the ways of remembrance.</span>
