      is not of thy seed. He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, 
      must needs be circumcised.

And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:
For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants.

heathen that are round about you: of them shall ye buy bond-men and bond-maids. Moreover, of the 
children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families 
that are with you, which they begat in your land. And they shall be your
possession. And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit

<dd>The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour
    when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with
    the unbelievers. And that servant,
    which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according
    to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.

Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded
    him? I trow not.    
    
<p><dt><a href="../1cor/7.html#21">1 Corinthians 7:21-22</a>
<dd>Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it 
rather. For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman:
likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant.

<dd>Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their masters
worthy of all honor, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.
And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because
they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful
and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.
If any man teach otherwise ... he is proud, knowing nothing.... From such withdraw thyself.
