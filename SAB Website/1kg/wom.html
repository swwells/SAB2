<p><li>Old King David tries to get some heat by having a beautiful virgin minister unto him. 
<a href="1.html#1">1:1-4</a>

<p><li>"King Solomon loved many strange women."<br>
God didn't mind the number so much; it was their "strangeness" that he objected to.  <a href="11.html#1">11:1</a>

<p><li>"The LORD said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you: 
for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods."<br>
Note that Solomon is told to stay away from foreign women. Why? Because they have different ("strange") 
religious beliefs, and God disapproves of mixed-faith marriages. <a href="11.html#2">11:2</a>

<p><li>"He [Solomon] had seven hundred wives ... and three hundred concubines." <a href="11.html#3">11:3</a>

<p><li>His wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God."<br>
The wisest man that ever lived (<A href="4.html#31">1 Kings 4:31</A>) was misled by his wives into worshipping other gods. 
<a href="11.html#4">11:4</a>
 
<p><li>The dogs shall eat Jezebel."<br>
Jezebel (Ahab's "strange" wife) "stirred up" Ahab to "work wickedness in the sight of the Lord." To punish her, 
God will feed her dead body to the dogs. He also plans to feed Ahab's family to the dogs (if they live in the city) 
and to the birds (if they are country folks). <a href="21.html#23">21:23-25</a>
