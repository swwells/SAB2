<img src="../images/pr1.gif" >(12:52-53) Jesus prophesies that families will be divided because 
of him and his teachings. Sadly, this is one prophecy that has been fulfilled.

<p>(12:52) <i>"For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three."</i>

<p>(12:53) <i>"The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, 
and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law."</i>

Jesus calls the people hypocrites because
they cannot &quot;discern this time.&quot;
