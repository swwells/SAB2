Nephi sees the "great and abominable church" (the Catholic church) and its founder, the devil.

<p>(13:4-5) <i>"The formation of a great church ... a church which is most abominable above all other churches"</i>

<p>(13:6) <i>"I beheld this great and abominable church; and I saw the devil that he was the founder of it."</i><br>

<p>(13:7) <i>"And I saw many harlots."</i>

<p>(13:8) <i>"The gold, and the silver, and the silks, and the scarlets, and the fine-twined linen, and the precious 
clothing, and the harlots, are the desires of this great and abominable church."</i>

<p>(13:9) <i>"For the praise of the world do they destroy the saints of God, and bring them down into captivity."</i>

<p><font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (13:10) The angel shows Nephi a Google Earth view of the Atlantic Ocean (the "many waters") 
that divides the old and new worlds.

<p><i>"I ... beheld many waters; and they divided the Gentiles from the seed of my brethren."</i><br>

<p><img src="../../images/int.gif">
<img src="../../images/inj1.gif">(13:11) The wrath of God is on the Native Americans (Nephi's brethren).

<img src="../../images/pr1.gif"> (13:12-13)

<p>(13:12) The angel shows Nephi Christopher Columbus crossing the "many waters" in 1492 to 
visit the native Americans. (<a href="#Columbus" title="Fulfillment of Book of Mormon Prophecy">1</a>)

<p><i>"And I looked and beheld a man among the Gentiles, who was 
separated from the seed of my brethren by the many waters; and I beheld the Spirit of God, 
that it came down and wrought upon the man; and he went forth upon the many waters, even 
unto the seed of my brethren, who were in the promised land."</i>

<p>(13:13) <i>"I beheld the Spirit of God, that it wrought upon other Gentiles; and they went forth out of 
captivity, upon the many waters. "</i><br>
These "other Gentiles" were the Pilgrims arriving at Plymouth Rock in 1620.

<p>(13:14) God's wrath is on the Native Americans who were slaughtered by the Europeans.

<p><i>"I beheld many multitudes of the Gentiles upon the land of promise; and I beheld the wrath of God, 
that it was upon the seed of my brethren; and they were scattered before the Gentiles and 
were smitten."</i>

<p>(13:15) God inspired the Europeans (who "were white, and exceedingly fair and beautiful" just like Nephi's descendants before the evil, 
dark-skinned  Laminites killed them all) to slaughter the Native Americans.

<p><i>"The Spirit of the Lord, that it was upon the Gentiles, and they did prosper and obtain the land for their

<p>(13:18) God helped the American colonists win the Revolutionary War.

<p><i>"The power of God was with them, and also 
that the wrath of God was upon all those that were gathered together against them to 
battle."</i>

<p>(13:19) God helped the Americans win all their other wars too. (Except maybe the Vietnam war.)

of all other nations."</i>

<img src="../../images/pr1.gif"> (13:20-24) The angel shows Nephi a book that "proceedeth out of the mouth of a Jew" 
(the Bible, which was a lot like the brass plates). The good American white people that God liked so much carried this 
book around with them.

<p>(13:20-23) <i>"I beheld a book, and it was carried forth among them ... And he said: Behold it proceedeth 
out of the mouth of a Jew ... like unto the engravings which are upon the plates of brass"</i><br>

<tr><td><b><a name="19">13:19</b></a>   And I, Nephi, beheld that <span class="a">the Gentiles that had gone out 
of captivity were delivered by the power of God out of the hands of all other nations.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="20">13:20</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that I, Nephi, 
beheld that they did prosper in the land; and <span class="a">I beheld a book, and it was carried forth 
among them. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="21">13:21</b></a>   And the angel said unto me: Knowest thou the meaning of 
the book? 

<tr><td><b><a name="22">13:22</b></a>   And I said unto him: I know not. 

<tr><td><b><a name="23">13:23</b></a>   <span class="a">And he said: Behold it proceedeth out of the mouth of a 
Jew.</span>   And I, Nephi, beheld it; and he said unto me: The book that thou beholdest is a 
record of the Jews, which contains the covenants of the Lord, which he hath made unto the 
house of Israel; and it also containeth many of the prophecies of the holy prophets; and it 
is a record <span class="a">like unto the engravings which are upon the plates of brass</span>, save there are not 
so many; nevertheless, they contain the covenants of the Lord, which he hath made unto the 
house of Israel; wherefore, they are of great worth unto the Gentiles. 

<tr><td><b><a name="24">13:24</b></a>   And the angel of the Lord said unto me: Thou hast beheld 
that the book proceeded forth from the mouth of a Jew; and when it proceeded forth from the 
mouth of a Jew <span class="a">it contained the fulness of the gospel of the Lord, of whom the twelve 
apostles bear record</span>; and they bear record <span class="a">according to the truth which is in the Lamb of 
God.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="25">13:25</b></a>   Wherefore, these things go forth from the Jews 
in purity unto the Gentiles, according to the truth which is in God. 

<tr><td><b><a name="26">13:26</b></a>   And after they go forth by the hand of the twelve apostles 
of the Lamb, from the Jews unto the Gentiles, thou seest the formation of <span class="i">a great and 
abominable church, which is most abominable above all other churches; for behold, they 
have taken away from the gospel of the Lamb many parts which are plain and most precious; 
and also many covenants of the Lord have they taken away.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="27">13:27</b></a>   And all this have they done that they might 
<span class="plag">pervert the right ways of the Lord</span>, that they might blind the eyes and harden the hearts of the 
children of men. 

<tr><td><b><a name="28">13:28</b></a>   Wherefore, thou seest that after the book hath gone forth 
through the hands of <span class="i">the great and abominable church, that there are many plain and 
precious things taken away from the book</span>, which is the book of the Lamb of God. 

<tr><td><b><a name="29">13:29</b></a>   And after these <span class="i">plain and precious 
things were taken away</span> it goeth forth unto all the nations of the Gentiles; and after it goeth forth unto all the 
nations of the Gentiles, yea, even across the many waters which thou hast seen with the 
Gentiles which have gone forth out of captivity, thou seest -- because of the 
<span class="i">many plain and precious things which have been taken out of the book</span>, which were plain unto the 
understanding of the children of men, according to the plainness which is in the Lamb of 
God -- because of <span class="i">these things which are taken away out of the gospel</span> of the Lamb, 
an <span class="a">exceedingly</span> great many do stumble, yea, insomuch that Satan 
hath great power over them. 

<tr><td><b><a name="30">13:30</b></a>   Nevertheless, thou beholdest that <span class="i">the Gentiles who have 
gone forth out of captivity, and have been lifted up by the power of God above all other 
nations, upon the face of the land which is choice above all other lands</span>, which is the land 
that <span class="i">the Lord God hath covenanted with thy father that his seed should have for the land of 
their inheritance; wherefore</span>, thou seest that the Lord <span class="i">God will not suffer that the 
Gentiles will utterly destroy the mixture of thy seed, which are among thy 
brethren.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="31">13:31</b></a>   Neither will he suffer that the Gentiles shall destroy 
the seed of thy brethren.

<tr><td><b><a name="32">13:32</b></a>   <span class="a">Neither will the Lord God 
suffer that the Gentiles shall forever remain in that awful state of blindness</span>, which thou 
beholdest they are in, because of <span class="i">the plain and most precious parts of the gospel of the 
Lamb which have been kept back by that abominable church</span>, whose formation thou hast 
seen. 

<tr><td><b><a name="33">13:33</b></a>   Wherefore saith the Lamb of God: I will be merciful unto 
the Gentiles, unto the visiting of the remnant of the house of Israel in great 
judgment. 

<tr><td><b><a name="34">13:34</b></a>  <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the angel 
of the Lord spake unto me, saying: Behold, saith the Lamb of God, <span class="a">after I have visited the 
remnant of</span> the house of Israel -- and this remnant of whom I speak is <span class="a">the seed of thy 
father </span>-- wherefore, after I have visited them <span class="a">in judgment, and smitten them by the hand of 
the Gentiles</span>, and after the Gentiles do stumble <span class="a">exceedingly</span>, because 
of the most plain and precious parts of the gospel of the Lamb which have been kept back by 
that abominable church, which is the mother of harlots, saith the Lamb -- <span class="a">I will be 
merciful unto the Gentiles</span> in that day, insomuch that I will bring forth unto them, in 
mine own power, much of my gospel, which shall be plain and precious, saith the Lamb. 
 
<tr><td><b><a name="35">13:35</b></a>   For, behold, saith the Lamb: I will manifest myself unto 
thy seed, that they shall write many things which I shall minister unto them, which shall 
be plain and precious; <span class="a">and after thy seed shall be destroyed, and 
  dwindle in unbelief, 
and also the seed of thy brethren, behold, these things shall be hid up, to come forth 
unto the Gentiles</span>, by the gift and power of the Lamb.  

<tr><td><b><a name="36">13:36</b></a>   And <span class="a">in them shall be written my gospel, saith the Lamb, 
and my rock and my salvation.<?span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="37">13:37</b></a>   And <span class="a">blessed are they 
who shall seek to bring forth my Zion</span> at that day, <span class="a">for they shall have the gift and the 
power of the Holy Ghost</span>; and if they endure unto the end they shall be lifted up at the 
last day, and shall be saved in the everlasting kingdom of the Lamb; and whoso shall 
publish peace, yea, tidings of great joy, how beautiful upon the mountains shall they 
be. 

<tr><td><b><a name="38">13:38</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that I beheld 
the remnant of the seed of my brethren, and also the book of the Lamb of God, which had 
proceeded forth from the mouth of the Jew, that it came forth from the Gentiles unto the 
remnant of the seed of my brethren.

<tr><td><b><a name="39">13:39</b></a>   And <span class="a">after it had come forth unto them I beheld other books, which 
came forth by the power of the Lamb</span>, from the Gentiles unto them, unto the convincing of 
the Gentiles and the remnant of the seed of my brethren, and also the Jews who were 
scattered upon all the face of the earth, that the records of the prophets and of the 
twelve apostles of the Lamb are true. 

<tr><td><b><a name="40">13:40</b></a>   And the angel spake unto 
me, saying: <span class="a">These last records</span>, which thou hast seen among the Gentiles, <span class="a">shall establish 
the truth of the first, which are of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, and shall make known 
the plain and precious things which have been taken away from them; and shall make known 
to all kindreds, tongues, and people, that </span><span class="plag">the Lamb of God is the Son of 
the Eternal Father</span>, <span class="a">and the Savior of the world; and that all men must come unto him, or they cannot be 
saved.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="41">13:41</b></a>   And they must come according to the words which shall be 
established by the mouth of the Lamb; and the words of the Lamb shall be made known in the 
records of thy seed, as well as <span class="plag">in the records of the twelve apostles of the 
Lamb</span>; wherefore they both shall be established in one; for there is one God and one Shepherd 
over all the earth. 

<tr><td><b><a name="42">13:42</b></a>   And the time cometh that he shall manifest himself unto all nations, 
both unto the Jews and also unto the Gentiles; and after he has manifested himself unto 
the Jews and also unto the Gentiles, then he shall manifest himself unto the Gentiles and 
also unto the Jews, and <span class="plag">the last shall be first, and the first shall be last</span>.
