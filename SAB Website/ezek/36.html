  And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall
    be my people, and I will be your God.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the
    corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field,
    that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="31">36:31</A></B>
  Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not
    good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and
    for your abominations.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord GOD, be it known unto you: be

  Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from
    all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities, and the
    wastes shall be builded.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the

  And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden
    of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced, and
    are inhabited.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="36">36:36</A></B>
  Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the LORD
    build the ruined places, and plant that that was desolate: I the LORD have
    spoken it, and I will do it.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="37">36:37</A></B>
  Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet for this be enquired of by the house
    of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them with men like a flock.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="38">36:38</A></B>
  As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so
    shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know
    that I am the LORD.
