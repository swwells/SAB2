  Thus saith the LORD; Stand in the court of the LORD's house, and speak

  So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking

  <tr><td><B><A name="8">26:8</A></B>
  Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that

    and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house shall

    all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the

  Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the

  <tr><td><B><A name="12">26:12</A></B>
  Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying,

    the words that ye have heard.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="13">26:13</A></B>

    words in your ears.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="16">26:16</A></B>
  Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the

  <tr><td><B><A name="17">26:17</A></B>
  Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the
    assembly of the people, saying,<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="18">26:18</A></B>
  Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and
    spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Zion
    shall be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the
    mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="19">26:19</A></B>
  Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he
    not fear the LORD, and besought the LORD, and <span class="c">the LORD repented him of the evil which he
    had pronounced against them</span>? Thus might we procure great evil against
    our souls.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="20">26:20</A></B>
  And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah

    against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="21">26:21</A></B>
  And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes,
    heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when Urijah heard
    it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt;<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="22">26:22</A></B>
  And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of
    Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="23">26:23</A></B>
  And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim
    the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the
    graves of the common people.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="24">26:24</A></B>
  Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that
