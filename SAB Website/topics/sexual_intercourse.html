<ol>
<p><li>"And Adam knew Eve." <a href="../gen/4.html#1">Gen.4:1</a> <br>
(The first sexual intercourse mentioned in the bible.)
<p><li>"And Cain knew his wife." <a href="../gen/4.html#17">Gen.4:17</a><br>
(That's nice, but where the hell did she come from? The Bible doesn't mention any of Cain's sisters. Well, maybe he married
    his mom.) 
<p><li>"And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son." <a href="../gen/4.html#25">Gen.4:25</a>
<p><li>"The sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty
    men which were of old, men of renown." <a href="../gen/6.html#4">Gen.6:4</a>
<p><li>"And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from
    bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram
    hearkened to the voice of Sarai. <a href="../gen/16.html#2">Gen.16:2</a>

<p><li>"Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I
    pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your
    eyes." <a href="../gen/19.html#8">Gen.19:8</a>
<p><li>"And Lot went up out of Zoar ...and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters. And the firstborn said unto 
the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the 
earth: Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. And 
they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not 
when she lay down, nor when she arose. And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, 
Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, 
that we may preserve seed of our father. And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, 
and lay with him; and he  perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose." <a href="../gen/19.html#30">Gen.19:30-35</a>
<p><li>"And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may
    go in unto her. ... And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him;
    and he went in unto her. ...  And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah." <a href="../gen/29.html#21">Gen.29:21-25</a>
<p><li>"And he went in also unto Rachel." <a href="../gen/29.html#30">Gen.29:30</a>
<p><li>"And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob,
    Give me children, or else I die. ... And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon 
my knees,that I may also have children by her. And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her." 
<a href="../gen/30.html#1">Gen.30:1-4</a>
<p><li>"And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes. And Jacob came out of the 
field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee 
with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night." <a href="../gen/30.html#15">Gen.30:15-16</a>

her." <a href="../gen/38.html#2">Gen.38:2</a>
<p><li>"And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother. And 
Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled 
it on the ground...." <a href="../gen/38.html#8">Gen.38:8-9</a>
<p><li>"When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face. And he turned unto her 
by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) ...
And he ... came in unto her, and she conceived by him." <a href="../gen/38.html#15">Gen.38:15-18</a>
<p><li>"And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph;
    and she said, Lie with me." <a href="../gen/39.html#7">Gen.39:7</a>
<p><li>"And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in
    her hand, and fled, and got him out." <a href="../gen/39.html#12">Gen.39:12</a>
<p><li>"That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath

    water, and be unclean until the even.  And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of copulation, shall 
be washed with water, and be unclean until the even. The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of copulation, 
they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the even." <a href="../lev/15.html#16">Lev.15:16-18</a>
<p><li>"Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith: neither shall any
    woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it is confusion." <a href="../lev/18.html#23">Lev.18:23</a>
<p><li>"And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast." 
<a href="../lev/20.html#15">Lev.20:15</a>
<p><li>"And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he

father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity unto the elders of the 
city in the gate....  But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel: Then they shall 
bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die."

because she cried not, being in the city" <a href="../dt/22.html#23">Dt.22:23-24</a>
<p><li>"If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they

    his wife; because he hath humbled her." <a href="../dt/22.html#28">Dt.22:28-29</a>
<p><li>"If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not
