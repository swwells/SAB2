<p><li>In David's last words, he commands his son Solomon to murder Joab.  <a href="2.html#1">2:1-9</a>

<p><li>Solomon has his brother (Adonijah) murdered.  <a href="2.html#24">2:24-25</a>

<p><li>Solomon carries out the deathbed instructions of his father David by having Joab murdered. 
 <a href="2.html#29">2:29-34</a>
 
<p><li>Solomon justifies the murder of Joab by saying that Joab also was a murderer, and that the blood of Joab's victims
"shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever." 
<a href="2.html#33">2:33</a>

<p><li>But Solomon is not done murdering yet. He has Shimei murdered -- or as Solomon put it, "The Lord shall return
thy wickedness upon thine own head."  <a href="2.html#44">2:44, 46</a>

<p><li>When dedicating the temple, Solomon kills 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. All this blood and gore must have
made God very happy.  <a href="8.html#63">8:63</a>

<p><li>Joab (David's captain) spent six months killing every male in Edom. <a href="11.html#16">11:16</a>

<p><li>There were these two prophets. The first prophet lied to the second. To the punish the second for 
 believing the first's lie, God sends a lion to kill him. Get it? <a href="13.html#11">13:11-24</a>
 
 <p><li>To punish Jeroboam, God killed his son.  <a href="14.html#8">14:8-17</a>
 
<p><li>God promises to "bring evil upon the house of Jerobaom," saying he will "cut off" anyone "that
pisseth against the wall." Then, after he is done with them, their dead bodies will be eaten by dogs (if they are 
city dwellers) or fowls (if they are country folk). <a href="14.html#10">14:10-12</a>

<p><li>Baasha kills "all of the house of Jeroboam" leaving none "to breath." This slaughter was done "according to the
word of the Lord."  <a href="15.html#29">15:29</a>

<p><li>Zimri kills everyone "that pisseth against a wall ... according to the word of the Lord."  
<a href="16.html#11">16:11-12</a>

<p><li>Elijah kills 450 prophets of Baal.  <a href="18.html#22">18:22, 40</a>

<p><li>God delivers the Syrians into the Israelites hands, and 100,000 were killed in one day. Of those that
escaped, 27,000 were crushed by a falling wall. <a href="20.html#28">20:28-30</a>

<p><li>There was this son of a prophet that said to his neighbor, "kill me." 
But the neighbor refused. So God sent a lion to devour him. <a href="20.html#35">20:35</a>

<p><li>"Thus saith the Lord, in the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine."
 <a href="21.html#19">21:19</a>
 
<p><li>Jezebel (Ahab's "strange" wife) "stirred up" Ahab to "work 
wickedness in the sight of the Lord." To punish her, God will feed her dead body to the dogs. (He 
also plans to feed the city folk to the dogs and country folks to the birds.) 
<a href="21.html#23">21:23-25</a>
