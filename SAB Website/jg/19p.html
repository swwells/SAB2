    This story seems to be based upon <a href="../gen/19.html">Genesis 19</a>, where the <a href="../2pet/2.html#7">just and righteous Lot</a> offers his virgin daughters to a crowd of angel rapers.
    
    <p>This time, though, the visitor that the men of the city found so attractive was a Levite, not a couple of angels.
    
    <p>The Levite had a concubine that "played the whore against him" by returning to her father's house. 
    
    <p>(19:1) <i>"There was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine."</i>
    
    <p>(19:2) <i>"And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from him unto her father's house ... and

  And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that
    there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim, who took
    to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah. 
  
  <tr><td><B><A name="2">19:2</A></B>
  And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from him
    unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four whole months.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="3">19:3</A></B>
  And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto her, and
    to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and
    she brought him into her father's house: and when the father of the damsel
    saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="4">19:4</A></B>
  And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode
    with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="5">19:5</A></B>
  And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the
    morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's father said unto his
    son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go
    your way.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

host offers his virgin daughter and his guest's concubine to a mob of perverts
(who want to have sex with his guest). The mob refuses the daughter, but accepts
the concubine and they "abuse her all night." The next morning she
crawls back to the doorstep. The Levite puts her body on an ass
and takes it home. Then he chops the body up into twelve pieces 
(<a href="http://reannotated.blogspot.com/2008/08/now-will-we-deal-worse-with-thee-than.html">while still alive?</a>) and sends them
to each of the twelve tribes of Israel (Parcel Post?). The story, which must be
one of the most disgusting stories ever told, ends with: "consider of it,
take advice, and speak your mind." Those who do consider it will
immediately reject the idea that the Bible is inspired by God. Hopefully, they
then will speak their mind.
