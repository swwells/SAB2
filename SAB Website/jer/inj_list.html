<H3>Jeremiah: Injustice</H3>
<ol>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="inj.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->
<p><li>God will set Jeremiah over nations and kingdoms do build up or destroy or whatever. <a href="1.html#10">1:10</a>

<p><li> God will send enemy nations against his "chosen people." <a href="1.html#14">1:14-15</a>

<p><li>Those who worship "other gods" are wicked. "I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, 
who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods." <a href="1.html#16">1:16</a>

<p><li>"They shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee." <a href="1.html#19">1:19</a>

<p><li> God tries to "correct" people by killing their children.  <a href="2.html#30">2:30</a>

<p><li>"The showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain."<br>
Droughts are punishments from God. <a href="3.html#3">3:3</a>

<p><li>"As a wife treacherously departeth from her husband...."<br>
If a woman leaves her husband, she is "treacherous," but a man is blameless when he "puts her away" for no 
reason. <a href="3.html#20">3:20</a>

<p><li>"Circumcise the foreskin of your heart" or God will burn you to death. <a href="4.html#4">4:4</a>

<p><li>"I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction." <a href="4.html#6">4:6</a>

<p><li>"The lion is come up from his thicket ... and thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant." <a href="4.html#7">4:7</a>

<p><li>Lament and howl: for the fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from us." <a href="4.html#8">4:8</a>

<p><li> &nbsp;God has &quot;greatly deceived this people.&quot;  <a href="4.html#10">4:10</a>

<p><li> What was once fruitful is now barren. Birds have fled, people are gone, towns are in ruins. All "by his (God's)
fierce anger." <a href="4.html#25">4:25-28</a>

<p><li>God tries to reform people by tormenting them and then wonders why it doesn't work. <a href="5.html#3">5:3</a>

<p><li> Those who don't follow or know God are "poor" and "foolish."  <a href="5.html#4">5:4</a>

<p><li> God will send lions, wolves, and leopards to tear people to pieces.<a href="5.html#6">5:6</a>

<p><li>"How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have ... committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses." 
<a href="5.html#7">5:7</a>

<p><li>God will burn the people to death for discovering his non-existence. <a href="5.html#14">5:14</a>

<p><li> God again talks of bringing a foreign nation to destroy his chosen ones and their lands.  
<a href="5.html#15">5:15-17</a>

<p><li>God just can't hold in his fury any longer. He will kill everyone: husbands and wives, children and old people.
<a href="6.html#11">6:11</a>

<p><li> God will punish the men by taking away their property, including their wives, and giving it to others.
 <a href="6.html#12">6:12</a>

<p><li> God "will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts" because they refuse to do 
whatever the hell he asks them to do. <a href="6.html#19">6:19</a> 

<p><li> God plans to kill pretty much everyone: fathers and sons, 
family, friends, and neighbors. God plans to kill them all after laying a stumbling block before them.
 <a href="6.html#21">6:21</a>
 
<p><li>God will send soldiers from the north that will kill everyone and 
have no mercy. <a href="6.html#22">6:22-23</a>

<p><li>God says that there are some people that you just shouldn't bother 
praying for. And if you do he won't listen anyway. <a href="7.html#16">7:16</a>

<p><li> God will pour out his anger on both man and beast. Not even the trees will 
be spared from his wrath. And the ground itself will burn forever.  <a href="7.html#20">7:20</a>

<p><li>"The LORD hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath."  <a href="7.html#29">7:29</a>   

<p><li> God will feed the people to the birds and the beasts, &quot;and none shall fray 
them away.&quot;&nbsp;  <a href="7.html#33">7:33</a>

<p><li>To punish the men, God will "give their wives to others." <a href="8.html#10">8:10</a>

<p><li> Don't trust anyone. Not even your neighbors, family, or friends. Those who 
believe differently than you are all liars and evil doers. <a href="9.html#4">9:4-6</a>

<p><li> God will give the people bad food and water, and then kill them with a 
sword. <a href="9.html#15">9:15-16</a>

<p><li> God will kill children and young men, and the dead bodies "shall fall as dung .... and none shall 
gather them."   <a href="9.html#21">9:21-22</a>

<p><li> "Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised." I
guess that'd include just about everyone -- well, all the men anyway.   <a href="9.html#25">9:25-26</a>

<p><li> Jeremiah prays for the destruction of people and families that don't call on God's name. 
<a href="10.html#25">10:25</a>

<p><li>Those who don't follow the Old Testament laws are cursed by God. <a href="11.html#3">11:3</a>

<p><li> God &quot;will bring evil upon&quot; people from which they will not be able to 
escape. And if they cry out to him for help, he will not help them. <a href="11.html#11">11:11</a>

<p><li> God forbids others from praying for his victims. Such prayers would go unanswered anyway, he says, 
because he &quot;will not hear them in their time of trouble.&quot;  <a href="11.html#14">11:14</a>

<p><li> "For the Lord of hosts ... hath pronounced evil against thee."
<a href="11.html#17">11:17</a>

<p><li>Jeremiah prays for vengeance upon his enemies. <a href="11.html#20">11:20</a>

<p><li> God will punish the people by killing their young men in war and starving their children to 
death. <a href="11.html#22">11:22</a>

<p><li> Jeremiah asks God to drag away his enemies like &quot;sheep for the slaughter.&quot;&nbsp; 
<a href="12.html#3">12:3</a>

<p><li>God delivered his people "into the hand of her enemies." He "hates" his "dearly 
beloved" people and plans to feed them to the birds. <a href="12.html#7">12:7-9</a>

<p><li> God's sword will "devour" everyone until "no flesh shall have peace." <a href="12.html#12">12:12</a>

<p><li> If any nation does not listen to God, he "will utterly pluck up and destroy that 
nation." <a href="12.html#17">12:17</a>

<p><li> God plans to make everyone in the kingdom drunk and then "dash the fathers and the sons 
together." The merciful God of peace vows to "not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy them."  <a href="13.html#12">13:12-14</a>

<p><li>"For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered, and thy heels made bare." <a href="13.html#22">13:22</a>
 
<p><li>God tells Jeremiah not to pray for the people. God has decided to kill them all and he doesn't want to 
be talked out of it. <a href="14.html#11">14:11</a>

<p><li> God will ignore the peoples' prayers, and kill them all with war, starvation, and disease.
  <a href="14.html#12">14:12</a>
  
<p><li> God will destroy by famine and sword those who are misled by the prophets, as well as the prophets 
themselves.  <a href="14.html#15">14:15-16</a>

<p><li>God tells Jeremiah not to bother praying for the people. Even if Moses and Samuel (and 
Jesus?) were to ask him to reconsider, he wouldn't. He's going to kill everybody and nobody can stop him!
<a href="15.html#1">15:1</a>

<p><li>God has it all planned out. He'll kill some with the sword, some with famine, and he'll feed the rest to the dogs and birds. 
Why will he do these terrible things? Because of something a former king did.  <a href="15.html#2">15:2-4</a>

<p><li> God again threatens Jerusalem with mass destruction.  Here are some of the highlights: 
He will kill children, make more widows than there are grains of 
sand, terrorize cities, and then kill the survivors. <a href="15.html#7">15:7-9</a>

<p><li> "A fire is kindled in mine anger, which shall burn upon you." <a href="15.html#14">15:14</a>

<p><li> God tells Jeremiah not to get married or have children, because he's 
going to kill everyone (mothers and daughters, fathers and sons). They all &quot;shall die of grievous 
deaths,&quot; and that shall neither &quot;be lamented&quot; nor buried, but &quot;shall 
be as dung upon the face of the earth.&quot;  For he has removed peace, "lovingkindness," and mercy 
from the people.  <a href="16.html#1">16:1-7</a>

<p><li> God will kill children if their parents worship other gods. <a href="16.html#10">16:10-11</a>

<p><li> God will enslave the people of Judah because they worshipped the wrong gods. 
<a href="17.html#4">17:4</a>

<p><li> Jeremiah asks God to bring evil upon his enemies and to "destroy them with double destruction."  
<a href="17.html#18">17:18</a>

<p><li> If you don't honor the Sabbath, God will burn you to death unquenchable fire. 
<a href="17.html#27">17:27</a>

<p><li>God is a bad potter. Don't complain about it. <a href="18.html#1">18:1-6</a>

<p><li> God admits that he does evil things to people.  <a href="18.html#11">18:11</a>

<p><li>God will make the land desolate, "a perpetual hissing," so that "very one that passeth 
thereby shall be astonished, and wag his head." <a href="18.html#16">18:16</a>

<p><li>God will scatter the Israelites before their enemy. And then, on "the day of their 
calamity," he'll show them his backside instead of his face. <a href="18.html#17">18:17</a>

<p><li> Jeremiah asks God to kill the young men in war and the children by starvation.  
<a href="18.html#21">18:21</a>

<p><li>"Forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight." <a href="18.html#23">18:23</a>

<p><li> God will do so much evil to the people that whoever hears of it will have their ears tingle.  
<a href="19.html#3">19:3</a>

<p><li> God will make parents eat their own children, and friends eat each other. <a href="19.html#7">19:7-9</a>

<p><li>God will break those who worship other gods as though they were made of clay, killing 
so many that there will not be enough room to bury them all. <a href="19.html#11">19:11-13</a>

<p><li>"Thus saith the LORD ... I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against
    it, because they have hardened their necks, that they might not hear my words." <a href="19.html#15">19:15</a>

<p><li>Jeremiah prophesies his rival's death (along with his famly and friends). <a href="20.html#4">20:4-6</a>
   
<p><li> God himself will fight and kill everyone in fury "with an outstretched hand and 
with a strong arm."  <a href="21.html#5">21:5</a>

<p><li>"I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great
    pestilence." <a href="21.html#6">21:6</a>
    
<p><li> God will deliver Zedekiah and those that survive the famine, disease, and war into Nebuchadrezzar's hand, and &quot;he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither
have pity, nor have mercy.  <a href="21.html#7">21:7</a>

<p><li>  God tells the Judeans to either surrender to the Babylonians and become their slaves or die.  
"Behold, I am against thee."  No kidding.  <a href="21.html#9">21:9-13</a>

<p><li>God will have Jeconiah's enemies kill him and his mother and then 
ensure that he die without leaving any sons. <a href="22.html#25">22:25-30</a> 

<p><li>God promises to bring more evil upon his chosen people. <a href="23.html#12">23:12</a>

<p><li> God promises to kill everyone by war, starvation, and disease.  <a href="24.html#10">24:10</a>

<p><li>Because the people of Judah were unfaithful to him, God will send the king of Babylon (Nebuchadrezzar) to destroy 
Jerusalem and enslave Judah. <a href="25.html#6">25:6-11</a>

<p><li>God says he is going to punish Nebuchadnezzar and the 
Babylonians for what they have done to his people -- even though God Himself is the one who made the 
Babylonians attack and enslave Judah!  As part of the punishment God will take the land of the 
Babylonians and "make it perpetual desolations."  A false prophecy, since present-day Iraq is quite 
occupied.<a href="25.html#12">25:12-13</a>

<p><li>God will force "all the kingdoms of the world" to drink "and be 
drunken." Then he'll kill "all the inhabitants of the earth" with a sword. <a href="25.html#15">25:15-29</a>

<p><li> God will kill so many people that the entire earth will be covered with their dead bodies. 
No one is to mourn them or even bury them; &quot;they shall be dung upon the ground.&quot;  <a href="25.html#31">25:33-38</a>

<p><li>God will destroy "the peaceable habitations" and make the land desolate "because of his fierce anger." 
<a href="25.html#37">25:37-38</a>

<p><li>God tells Jeremiah to make a yoke, put it on his neck, and show it off to a long list of kings. The yoke was supposed to 
demonstrate how God wants them all to serve Nebuchadrezzar, the king of Babylon. Only God could come up with a plan like that.
<a href="27.html#2">27:2-12</a>

<p><li>God enslaved entire nations and forced them to serve Nebuchadnezzar, "his servant". He even 
gave him all the wild animals and forced them to serve him. <a href="27.html#6">27:6</a>, 
<a href="28.html#14">28:14</a>

<p><li> Anyone who disobeys King Nebuchadnezzar will be punished "with the sword, and with the famine, and 
with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand."  <a href="27.html#8">27:8</a>

<p><li>Then God (if you are foolish enough to believe Jeremiah) steps in and settles the matter. He is going to force 
every nation on earth to serve Nebuchadnezzar, along with all of the animals. <a href="28.html#12">28:12-14</a>

<p><li>God kills Hananiah for disagreeing with Jeremiah. <a href="28.html#16">28:16-17</a>

<p><li> God will send his usual blessings upon his people: "the sword, the famine, and the pestilence." He "will make
them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil." <a href="29.html#17">29:17-18</a>

<p><li>God will kill those who refuse listen to his prophets. <a href="29.html#19">29:19</a>

<p><li> God will deliver Ahab and Zedekiah into the hands of Nebuchadrezzar &quot;and he shall slay them 
before your eyes&quot; and Ahab will be "roasted 
in the fire."  <a href="29.html#21">29:21-22</a>

<p><li>God will punish the children of Shemaiah for their father's false prophecy. <a href="29.html#32">29:32</a>

<p><li>God punishes children for the sins of their parents. <a href="32.html#18">32:18</a>

<p><li>God brings evil upon people.  <a href="32.html#42">32:42</a>

<p><li> God litters the ground "with the dead bodies of men" that he has killed in 
his anger and fury. <a href="33.html#5">33:5</a>

<p><li>To punish the people for refusing to free their slaves, God over-reacts (just a tad) by 
threatening to send the sword, pestilence, and 
famine, saying he'll feed their dead bodies to the fowls and beasts of the earth. <a href="34.html#17">34:17-20</a>

<p><li>Because the Rechabites obeyed Jonadab by not drinking wine, while the people of Judah disobeyed God in some way or another, 
God is going to do evil things to them. <a href="35.html#17">35:17</a>

<p><li>"Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them."  <a href="36.html#3">36:3</a>

<p><li>"I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, 
and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them." <a href="36.html#31">36:31</a>

<p><li>"Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good." 
<a href="39.html#16">39:16</a>
