<p><li>God destroyed the Amorites who were a race of giants as tall 
as cedars and as strong as oaks. <a href="2.html#9">2:9</a>

<p><li>"Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion." <br>
Other translations have "Pleiades" instead of "seven stars." In any case, the Pleiades is an open star cluster 
that contains thousands of stars, not just the "seven stars" that are easily visible from earth without a telescope. 
And the constellation Orion is a collection of stars that happens to form an interesting, but temporary, pattern when 
viewed from earth. It was not purposefully designed by anyone or anything. <a href="5.html#8">5:8</a>

<p><li>"Shall not the land tremble for this?"<br>
(Earthquakes are a punishment from God.) <a href="8.html#8">8:8</a>

<p><li>"I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day." <a href="8.html#9">8:9</a>

<p><li>God will "cut them in the head" and "slay the last of them with the sword." Any that try to escape by diving to the bottom of the sea will be bitten,
 at God's command, by a sea-serpent. God will set his "eyes upon them for evil, not for good." <a href="9.html#1">9:1-4</a>
