The Amalekites were smitten before Amalek
(from whom they descended) was born. Amalek was the grandson of Esau (<a href="../gen/36.html#12">Genesis 36:12</a>).

<p><img src="../images/inj1.gif" > (14:8-15) Soon after Lot moved to Sodom, a war broke out between the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah and 
some of the other local kingdoms. The Sodomites were defeated and Lot was taken prisoner. That's when Abraham got involved. He sent an 
army of slaves to pursue and smite Lot's captors.

<p>(14:8) <i>"The king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah ... joined battle with them [the surrounding kingdoms]."</i>

<p>(4:10) <i>"And the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain."</i>

<a href="../contra/slavery.html">Does God approve of slavery?</a> 

<p><img src="../images/sci1.gif"> "Dan" is an obvious anachronism, since the city of Dan was not named "Dan" until the time of the Judges 
(<a href="../jg/18.html#29">Judges 18:29</a>). In fact, Dan (for whom the city 
was named) was not even born yet (<a href="30.html#6">Genesis 30:6</a>).<br>

<p>(14:18) <i>"And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God."</i><br>
Melchizedek, by the way, had no father or mother, no beginning or end, just like the Son of God. (<a href="../heb/7.html#1">Hebrews 7:1-3</a>)
