  <tr><td><B><A name="2">33:2</A></B> <span class="a">But did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD</span>, like unto the
    abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD had cast out before the children
    of Israel.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="3">33:3</A></B>
  For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken
    down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped
    all the host of heaven, and served them.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="4">33:4</A></B>
  Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD had said,
    In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="5">33:5</A></B>
  And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the
    house of the LORD.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="6">33:6</A></B>
  And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the
    son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used
    witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought
    much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="7">33:7</A></B>
  And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of
    God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house,
    and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will
    I put my name for ever:<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="8">33:8</A></B>
  Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land
    which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do
    all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes
    and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="9">33:9</A></B>
  So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, and to do
    worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of
    Israel.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="10">33:10</A></B>
  And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not
    hearken.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="11">33:11</A></B>
  Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of the king
    of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with
    fetters, and carried him to Babylon.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="12">33:12</A></B>
  And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and humbled
    himself greatly before the God of his fathers,<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="13">33:13</A></B>
  And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his
    supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then
    Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="14">33:14</A></B>
  Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side
    of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and
    compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put
    captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="15">33:15</A></B>
  And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the
    LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the
    LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="16">33:16</A></B>
  And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon peace
    offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of
    Israel.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="17">33:17</A></B>
  Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet unto
    the LORD their God only.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="18">33:18</A></B>
  Now the rest of the  acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the
    seers that spake to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they
    are written in the book of the kings of Israel.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  <tr><td><B><A name="19">33:19</A></B>
  His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his sins, and
    his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up groves
    and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they are written among the 
    sayings of the seers.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">  
  
  <tr><td><B><A name="20">33:20</A></B>
  So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house:
    and Amon his son reigned in his stead.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="21">33:21</A></B>
  Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two
    years in Jerusalem.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="22">33:22</A></B>
  But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Manasseh
    his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh
    his father had made, and served them;<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="23">33:23</A></B>
  And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had
    humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="24">33:24</A></B>
  And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="25">33:25</A></B>
  But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king
    Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.
