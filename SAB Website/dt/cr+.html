remain."  <a href="2.html#33">2:33-36</a>

city. <a href="3.html#3">3:3-6</a>

<p><li>God instructs the Israelites to kill, without mercy, all the inhabitants (strangers) of the land that they 
conquer.  <a href="7.html#2">7:2</a>

<p><li>If you do show any mercy to such strangers, "give your daughters to any of them, or "take" any of their daughters, then
you'll get God so angry that he'll "destroy thee suddenly."  <a href="7.html#4">7:4</a>

no pity on them." <a href="7.html#16">7:16</a>

<p><li>God will send hornets to kill your enemies, "for the Lord thy God is among you, 
a mighty God and terrible."  <a href="7.html#20">7:20-23</a>

<p><li>"If thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, and walk after other gods ... ye shall surely perish." 
<a href="8.html#19">8:19-20</a>

<p><li>God is "a consuming fire" that destroys people.  <a href="9.html#3">9:3</a>

<p><li>After God kills those of other faiths, be sure to reject their beliefs and do not 
learn about them. Otherwise God will have to kill you too. <a href="12.html#30">12:30</a>

<p><li>Prophets and dreamers are to be executed if they say or dream the wrong things.  
<a href="13.html#1">13:1-5</a>

<p><li>If your brother, son, daughter, wife, or friend tries to get you to worship another god, "thou shalt surely kill him,
thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death.&quot;  <a href="13.html#6">13:6-10</a>

<p><li> If you hear of a city where another god is worshiped, then destroy everyone in the city (even the cattle) and burn
it down. (Watch out Salt Lake!)  <a href="13.html#12">13:12-16</a>

<p><li>"But of the cities ... which the Lord thy God doth give thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that
breatheth." Kill the old men and women, the sick and the dying, the blind and the lame, pregnant mothers, nursing mothers,
infants, toddlers, and babies.  <a href="20.html#16">20:16</a>

<p><li>If you find a dead body and don't know the cause of death, then get all the elders together, cut off the head of a
heifer, wash your hands over its body, and say our hands have not shed this blood. (That'll do it!) 
 <a href="21.html#1">21:1-8</a>

with stones that he die."  <a href="21.html#18">21:18-21</a>

 <a href="21.html#22">21:22</a>
 
<p><li> If a man marries, then decides that he hates his wife, he can claim she wasn't a virgin when they were married. If

doorstep.  <a href="22.html#13">22:13-21</a>

in the next 52 verses. <a href="28.html#16">28:16-68</a>

<p><li>"Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body."  <a href="28.html#18">28:18</a>

<p><li>God will send you "cursing, vexing, the pestilence, consumption, fever, inflammation, extreme
burning, the sword, blasting, and mildew."  <a href="28.html#20">28:20-22</a>

<p><li>"The Lord will smite thee with the botch of Egypt, and the emerods [hemorrhoids], and with the scab, and with the
itch, whereof thou canst be healed. The Lord will smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart." 
 <a href="28.html#27">28:27-28</a>
 
<p><li>"The Lord will smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore botch that cannot be healed, from the sole of thy
foot unto the top of thy head."  <a href="28.html#35">28:35</a>

<p><li> "All these curses shall come upon thee ... and upon thy seed for ever."  <a href="28.html#48">28:48-49</a>

 <a href="28.html#53">28:53-55</a>

feet."  <a href="28.html#56">28:56-57</a>

<p><li>If you don't do as God says he'll send plagues to torment and destroy you.  
<a href="28.html#58">28:58-64</a>

<p><li>If you serve the gods of other nations, "all the curses that are in 
this book" will fall upon you. <a href="29.html#18">29:18-20</a>

<p><li>Moses tells the people that God will destroy
all the inhabitants of the lands that they pass through. <a href="31.html#3">31:3</a>

<p><li>When God gets mad -- watch out! He'll starve you to death, burn you with fire, and send vicious beasts to
devour you. He'll "destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs." Not even the
helpless and innocent are spared by this psychotic God.  <a href="32.html#21">32:21-26</a>

<p><li>"I kill ... I wound ... I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh."
Someone should take his sword and arrows away, at least until he's feeling better.
