<p><li>God promises to give Joshua all of the land that his "foot shall tread upon." He says that none of the people he
encounters will be able to resist him. But later we find that God didn't keep his promise, and that many tribes withstood
Joshua's attempt to steal their land.  <a href="1.html#3">1:3-5</a>

<p><li>Joshua tells the Israelites that God will "without fail" drive out the Canaanites and the Jebusites. But later, the Bible
tells us that he could not drive them out.  <a href="3.html#10">3:10</a>

 <a href="8.html#28">8:28</a>

<p><li>Joshua tells Manasseh that he will be able to drive out the Canaanites, but it turns out (see <a href="1.html#27">1:27-28</a>) that he
couldn't do it.  <a href="17.html#17">17:17-18</a>

But in several places the Bible tells us that these promises were not kept.  <a href="21.html#43">21:43-45</a>
