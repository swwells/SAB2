<i>"The coming of the Lord draweth nigh."</i> -- James 5:8</tr>

<tr><td colspan="2">
James is one of my favorite books in the bible. It doesn't contain much that is objectionable, and includes some really good 
ideas. Evangelical protestants, of course, don't much like the book of James, though few will admit it as openly as did their 
hero, Martin Luther. He despised it, calling it an "epistle of straw" since it so clearly contradicted his perverted belief 
that salvation comes from faith alone, independent of one's actions. <br>
<br>
Verses seldom quoted by born-again Christians:

<ul>
<p><li>"Pure religion ... is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted
from the world." 1:27
<p><li>"What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? Can faith save him?" 2:14
<p><li>"Faith without works is dead." 2:17, 20, 26
  <p><LI>"Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble." 2:19
  <p><li>"By works a man is justified, and not by faith only." 2:24
    <p><li>"Ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little 
    time, and then vanisheth away." (All we are is dust in the wind.) 4:14
    <p><li>"Ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you." 5:1
</uL>

<p>Of course, James also has some silly stuff. For example:

<ul>
<p><li>If you are merciless to others, God will be merciless to you. (Two wrongs make a right.) 2:13
  <p><LI>James says that, even in his day, all beasts, birds, serpents, and sea creatures had been tamed by humans. 3:7
  <p><LI>If your prayers are not answered, it's your own damned fault. 4:3
<p><li>Whoever is a friend of the world is an enemy of God.&nbsp;  4:4   
  <p><LI>"The coming of the Lord draweth nigh." 5:8
  <p><li>If you are sick, don't go to a medical doctor -- rely on the power of prayer.  5:14-15
</ul>

James clearly believes that people are justified by works,
&quot;and not by faith only.&quot; Yet Paul (Rom.4:5-6, Gal.2:16, Eph.2:8-9)
believes just the opposite: that people are justified by faith alone -- without
regard to, or even in spite of,&nbsp; their works.<br>
4 - Is Salvation by faith alone?
  <p style="margin-left: 10">
<img src="../images/good1.gif" width="32" height="32">(2:15-16) Help others that are in need; don't just wish them 
well. This is good advice, though it's unfortunate that James restricted this help to "brothers". 
      Did he mean by this that you only need to help fellow believers?

  I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. 19 Thou believest that there is 
  one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. 20 But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works 
  is dead? 21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? 22 Seest thou 
  how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect? 23 And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham 
  believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God. 24 Ye see then how that by 
  works a man is justified, and not by faith only. 25 Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had 
  received the messengers, and had sent them out another way? 26 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without 
  works is dead also.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
