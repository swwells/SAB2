<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="1">27:1</A></B>
  In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah
    came this word unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,<td bgcolor="eeeeee" rowspan="7">
    
   <font size="-1">
    <img src="../images/abs1.gif">
    <img src="../images/inj1.gif" width="32" height="32"> (27:2-12) God tells Jeremiah to make a yoke, put it on his neck, and show it off to a long list of 
    kings. The yoke was supposed to demonstrate how God wants them all to serve Nebuchadrezzar, the king of Babylon. Only God could come up 
    with a plan like that.
    
    <p>(27:2) <i>"Thus saith the LORD to me; Make thee bonds and yokes, and put them upon thy neck."</i>
    
    <p>(27:3) <i>"And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the
    king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon,
    by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of
    Judah."</i>
    
    <p>(27:6) <i>"I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar 
the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him."</i><br>
God enslaved entire nations and forced them to serve Nebuchadnezzar, "his servant".
 He even gave him all the wild animals and forced them to serve him.
