<p><b><a href="../gen/fv_list.html">Genesis</a></b>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../gen/fv.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->
<p><li>Because God liked Abel's animal sacrifice more than Cain's vegetables, Cain kills his brother 
Abel in a fit of religious jealousy. <a href="../gen/4.html#8">4:8</a>

<p><li>Lamech is the first of a long line of biblical men with more than one wife. It seems
that God approves of such marriages. <a href="../gen/4.html#19">4:19</a>

<p><li>The "just and righteous" Noah (<a href="../gen/6.html#9">6:9</a>, <a href="../gen/7.html#1">7:1</a>) plants a vineyard, gets drunk, and lies
around naked in his tent. His son, Ham, happens to see his father in this condition. When Noah
sobers up and hears "what his young son had done unto him" (what did he do besides look at
him?), he curses not Ham, who "saw the nakedness of his father," but Ham's son, Canaan. "A
servant of servants shall he [Canaan] be unto his brethren." This is a typical case of biblical
justice, and is one of many Bible passages that have been used to justify slavery. <a href="../gen/9.html#20">9:20-25</a>

<p><li>"And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger 
son had done unto him."<br>
What did Ham do? Did he just look at his naked father or was there something more to it than that? 
  Some commentators have suggested that Ham committed homosexual rape on his drunken father, and that 
  this was why Ham's descendants were eternally punished with slavery. <a href="../gen/9.html#24">9:24</a>
  
<p><li>Abram makes his wife lie for him, by telling the Egyptians that she is his sister. But at
least it was half-true, since she was his half-sister. Such incestuous marriages are condemned
elsewhere in the Bible, but god makes an exception for Abram and Sarai. (See 
<a href="../gen/17.html#15">Genesis 17:15-16</a>

where God blesses their marriage.) <a href="../gen/12.html#13">12:13</a>
<p><li>Sarai is the first of a long line of barren women who were desperate for children. (In
the Bible, it is the women who are barren, never the men.) She sends Abram into her
handmaid, Hagar, so that she can "obtain children by her." Abram gladly complies. 
<a href="../gen/16.html#1">16:1-4</a>

<p><li>Hagar conceives, making Sarai jealous. Abram tells Sarai to do to Hagar whatever she
wants. "And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled." <a href="../gen/16.html#6">16:6</a>

<p><li>An uncircumcised boy is to be abandoned by his parents and community. <a href="../gen/17.html#14">17:14</a>

<p><li>"I will not destroy it for ten's sake."<br>
    I guess God couldn't find even ten good Sodomites because he decides to kill them all in <a href="../gen/19.html#1">Genesis 19</a>. 
    Too bad Abraham didn't ask God about the children. Why not save them? If Abraham could find 10 good children, toddlers, infants, or babies, would 
    God spare the city? Apparently not. God doesn't give a damn about children. <a href="../gen/18.html#32">18:32</a>

<p><li>Lot refuses to give up his angels to the perverted mob, offering his two "virgin daughters"
instead. He tells the bunch of angel rapers to "do unto them [his daughters] as is good in your
eyes." This is the same man that is called "just" and "righteous" in 
<a href="../2pet/2.html#7">2 Peter 2:7-8</a>. <a href="../gen/19.html#8">19:8</a>

<p><li>God kills everyone (men, women, children, infants, newborns) in Sodom and Gomorrah
by raining "fire and brimstone from the Lord out of heaven." Well, almost everyone -- he
spares the "just and righteous" Lot and his family.<a href="../gen/19.html#24">19:24</a>

<p><li>Lot's nameless wife looks back, and God turns her into a pillar of salt. 
<a href="../gen/19.html#26">19:26</a>

<p><li>Lot and his daughters camp out in a cave for a while. The daughters get their "just
and righteous" father drunk, and have sexual intercourse with him, and each conceives and
bears a son (wouldn't you know it!). Just another wholesome family values Bible story. 
<a href="../gen/19.html#30">19:30-38</a>

<p><li>Honest Abe does the same "she's my sister" routine again, for the same cowardly reason.
And once again, the king just couldn't resist Sarah -- even though by now she is over 90 years
old. (See <a href="../gen/12.html#13">Gen.12:13-20</a> for the first, nearly identical, 
episode.) <a href="../gen/20.html#2">20:2</a>

<p><li>God gets angry with king Abimelech, though the king hasn't even touched Sarah. He
says to the king, "Behold, thou art but a dead man," and threatens to kill him and all of his
people. To compensate for the crime he never committed, Abimelech gives Abraham sheep,
oxen, slaves, silver, and land. Finally, after Abraham "prayed unto God," God lifts his
punishment to Abimelech, "for the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of
Abimelech, because of Sarah."  <a href="../gen/20.html#3">20:3-18</a>

<p><li>God "closed all the wombs" because Abimelech believed Abe's lie. <a href="../gen/20.html#18">20:18</a>
<p><li>Abraham married his sister, and God blessed their marriage 
(<a href="../gen/17.html#15">17:15-16</a>). <a href="../gen/20.html#12">20:12</a>

<p><li>Sarah, after giving birth to Isaac, gets angry again at Hagar (see 
<a href="../gen/16.html#5">16:5-6</a>) and tells Abraham to 'cast out this bondwoman and her son." God commands Abraham to
"hearken unto her voice." So Abraham abandons Hagar and Ishmael, casting them out into the
wilderness to die. <a href="../gen/21.html#10">21:10-14</a>

<p><li>After the water ran out, Hagar left Ishmael alone to die. But God heard the infant crying, so he had an angel cry to
 Hagar from heaven, telling her not to worry. God heard the child's cry and opened Hagar's eyes so she could see a well, 
 filled with water. God said he'd make Ishmael a great nation, and the child became an archer. <a href="../gen/21.html#14">21:14-20</a>

<p><li>God orders Abraham to kill Isaac as a burnt offering. Abraham shows his love for
God by his willingness to murder his son. But finally, just before Isaac's throat is slit, God
provides a goat to kill instead. <a href="../gen/22.html#2">22:2-13</a>

<p><li>Abraham shows his willingness to kill his son for God. Only an evil God would ask a father to do that; only a bad 
father would be willing to do it. <a href="../gen/22.html#10">22:10</a>

<p><li>"Because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son."<br> Why did God love Abraham so much? 
Because he was willing to murder his son for him. (Greater evil hath no man than this, that he is willing to kill his own son for God.) 
<a href="../gen/22.html#16">22:16</a>

<p><li>Abraham had several concubines. <a href="../gen/25.html#6">25:6</a>

<p><li>Isaac loved Esau because Esau was a hunter and Isaac loved venison. Rebekah loved Jacob, but God hated Esau (see 
<a href="../rom/9.html#13">Romans 9:13</a>). No reason is given for why one son is loved while 
 the other is hated. But since God chose to act this way, it must have been as an example for parents to follow. Have 
 you decided which of your children to hate? <a href="../gen/25.html#28">25:28</a>
 
<p><li>Isaac uses the same "she's my sister" lie that his father twice used so effectively. (Once on the same King Abimelech) 
(see <a href="../gen/12.html#13">12:13</a>, <a href="../gen/20.html#2">20:2</a>). <a href="../gen/26.html#7">26:7</a>

<p><li>Esau &quot;takes&quot; two wives. <a href="../gen/26.html#34">26:34</a>
<p><li>Jacob, with coaching from his mother, obtains Isaac's blessing by lying. God seems to
have been fooled as well. <a href="../gen/27.html#19">27:19</a>

<p><li>Esau, who already had two wives (<a href="../gen/26.html#34" >26:34</a>), 
"takes" another. <a href="../gen/28.html#9">28:9</a>

<p><li>Jacob offers to work for seven years to pay for Rachel. As it turns out, he is tricked 
into having sex with her sister, Leah, instead, so he has to work for another seven years so in order 
to pay for them both.  <a href="../gen/29.html#18">29:18-30</a>

<p><li>Jacob is tricked by Laban, the father of Rachel and Leah. Jacob asks for Rachel so
that he can "go in unto her." But Laban gives him Leah instead, and Jacob "went in unto her
[Leah]" by mistake. Jacob was fooled until morning -- apparently he didn't know who he was
going in unto. Finally they worked things out and Jacob got to "go in unto" Rachel, too. 
<a href="../gen/29.html#21">29:21-30</a>

<p><li>Jacob finally gets to "go in unto" Rachel. He loved Rachel more than Leah. <a href="../gen/29.html#30">29:30</a>

<p><li>Since Jacob hated Leah, God decided to "open her womb" and make Rachel barren. (Like he did to Sarah and Rebekah.) 
 <a href="../gen/29.html#31">29:31</a>
 
<p><li>Leah conceives and bears four sons. And it's a good thing, too, since her husband 
hated her until then for not giving him any sons. <a href="../gen/29.html#32-34">29:32-34</a>

<p><li>"Give me children or else I die." Rachel considers herself worthless if she 
cannot produce children for her husband. But luckily she has an idea. She says to 
Jacob, "Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her." She solved the problem the same way 
as did Sarah (<a href="../gen/16.html#2">16:2</a>). "And Jacob went in unto her. And Bilhah 
conceived, and bare Jacob a son." (These arrangements rarely produce daughters.) 
<a href="../gen/30.html#1">30:1-4</a>

<p><li>Leah, not to be outdone, gives Jacob her maid (Zilpah) "to wife." And Zilpah "bare
Jacob a son." <a href="../gen/30.html#9">30:9</a>

<p><li>Rachel trades her husband's favors for some mandrakes. And so, when Jacob came
home, Leah said: "Thou must come in unto me, for surely I have hired thee with my son's
mandrakes. And he lay with her that night." Presumably God, by telling us this edifying story, is
teaching us something about sexual ethics. <a href="../gen/30.html#15">30:15-16</a>

<p><li>Leah thinks her husband will honor her now that she has given him six sons. <a href="../gen/30.html#20">30:20</a>

<p><li>"Then Jacob ... set his ... wives upon camels." Jacob had four wives (or two wives and
two concubines -- this distinction is not clear in the Bible): Rachel, Leah, Billah, and Zilpah.
There is no indication that God disapproves of this arrangement.  <a href="../gen/31.html#17">31:17</a>

<p><li>Jacob has two wives and two concubines, continuing the biblical tradition of polygamy. <a href="../gen/32.html#22">32:22</a>

<p><li>Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, is "defiled" by a man who seems to love her dearly. Her
brothers trick all of the men of the town and kill them (after first having them all circumcised),
and then take their wives and children captive.  <a href="../gen/34.html#1">34:1-31</a>

<p><li>&quot;Reuben went and lay with his father's concubine.&quot;&nbsp; 
<a href="../gen/35.html#22">35:22</a>, <a href="../gen/49.html#4">49:4</a> 

<p><li>Esau (Isaac's son) had several wives (continuing the tradition of polygamy, with no
editorial comment from the Bible). <a href="../gen/36.html#2">36:2, 6</a>

<p><li>Jacob loved Joseph more than his other children, and he made it pretty obvious. So the other kids 
    in the family hated Joseph. (God didn't seem to mind; he liked Joseph best, too.) 
    <a href="../gen/37.html#3">37:3-4</a>
    
<p><li>Judah has casual sex with a Canaanite woman which results in two sons, Er and Onan. 
<a href="../gen/38.html#2">38:2-4</a>

<p><li>After God killed Er, Judah tells Onan to "go in unto they brother's wife." But "Onan
knew that the seed should not be his; and ... when he went in unto his brother's wife ... he
spilled it on the ground.... And the thing which he did displeased the Lord; wherefore he slew
him also." This lovely Bible story is seldom read in Sunday School, but it is the basis of many
Christian doctrines, including the condemnation of both masturbation and birth control. 
<a href="../gen/38.html#8">38:8-10</a>

<p><li>Tamar (the widow of Er and Onan, who were killed by God) dresses up as a
prostitute and Judah (her father-in-law) propositions her, saying: "Let me come in unto thee ....
And he ... came in unto her, and she conceived by him." <a href="../gen/38.html#13">38:13-18</a>
<p><li>After Judah pays Tamar for her services, he is told that she "played the harlot" and "is
with child by whoredom." When Judah hears this, he says, "Bring her forth, and let her be
burnt." <a href="../gen/38.html#24">38:24</a>

<p><li>Moses was the product of an incestuous marriage. <a href="../ex/6.html#20">6:20</a>

<p><li>God explains to Moses that he intends to "smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast. 
<a href="../ex/12.html#12">12:12</a>

<p><li>After God has sufficiently hardened the Pharaoh's heart, he kills all the firstborn Egyptian children. When he was finished
"there was not a house where there was not one dead." Finally, he runs out of little babies to kill, so he slaughters the firstborn
cattle, too. <a href="../ex/12.html#29">12:29</a>

<p><li>Moses kisses his father-in-law (<a href="../contra/mosesfil.html">Jethro, Hobab, or Reul</a>) 
    and treats him as though he were a king, but he completely ignores his wife (Zipporah, who in <a href="../ex/4.html#24">4:24-26</a> saved

<p><li>If you "entice" an "unmarried maid" to "lie" with you, then you must marry her, unless the father

<p><li>Two of the sons of Aaron "offered strange fire before the Lord" and "there went out fire
from the Lord, and devoured them, and they died before the Lord." <a href="../lev/10.html#1">10:1-2</a>

<p><li>"And Aaron held his peace."<br>
Aaron watched in silence as God burned to death his sons. <a href="../lev/10.html#3">10:3</a>

<p><li>Moses tells Aaron that his sons were burned to death to sanctify and glorify God. <a href="../lev/10.html#3">10:3</a>

<p><li> Moses tells Aaron's cousins to drag the burned bodies out of the camp, and he warns Aaron not to mourn the death of his sons or God will

<p><li>"She shall be unclean."<br>
Women are dirty and sinful after childbirth, so God prescribes rituals for their purification. 
(And baby girls make them twice as sinful and dirty as baby boys do.)   <a href="../lev/12.html#1">12:1-5</a>

<p><li>"If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days ... And she shall then

If a boy is born, the mother is unclean for 7 days and must be purified for 33 days. <a href="../lev/12.html#2">12:2, 4</a>

<p><li>"She shall bring a lamb ... for a burnt offering, and... a young pigeon, or dove, for a sin offering."<br>
After a woman gives birth, a priest must kill a lamb, pigeon, or dove as a sin offering. This is because having children is sinful and God likes it when things are

<p><li>The Law of Jealousies. If a man suspects his wife of being unfaithful, he reports it to the priest. The priest then
makes her drink some "bitter water." If she is guilty, the water makes her thigh rot and her belly swell. If innocent, no harm
done -- the woman is free and will "conceive seed." In any case, "the man shall be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman shall

every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. But all the women children,
that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves." So they went back and did as Moses (and
presumably God) instructed, killing everyone except for the virgins. In this way they got 32,000 virgins -- Wow!

    that are come to thee."  <a href="../jos/2.html#1">2:1-4</a>
    
<p><li>"And the city shall be accursed ... and all that therein, to the Lord: only Rahab the harlot shall live."

with the edge of the sword."  <a href="../jos/6.html#21">6:21</a>

<p><li>After killing everyone, "they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein." Only the valuables (silver, gold, brass,
and iron) did they keep to "put into the treasury of the house of the Lord." <a href="../jos/6.html#24">6:24</a>

<p><li>Joshua says that those who try to rebuild Jericho will be accursed by God, and will have to sacrifice both their oldest
and their youngest sons in its construction. But Jericho still exists today, and is often considered to be the world's oldest,
continuously occupied city.  <a href="../jos/6.html#26">6:26</a>

<p><li>"And Joshua ... took Achan ... and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his sheep... And all of Israel
stoned them with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones." This is because Achan "took
of the accursed thing" -- whatever that means. But why would God require that Achan's sons and daughters (and even his
animals) be stoned to death along with him? The Bible doesn't say. But it does tell us that "the Lord turned from the
fierceness of his anger" when Achan, his children, and his animals were stoned to death and their dead bodies burned. 
 <a href="../jos/7.html#24">7:24-26</a>

is given his cousin for a prize.  <a href="../jg/1.html#12">1:12-13</a>

<p><li>Gideon orders his son to kill two kings, but he refuses. So Gideon has to do it himself since his son isn't "man"
enough to do it.  <a href="../jg/8.html#20">8:20-21</a>

<p><li>Gideon had 70 sons (no one knows how many daughters) "for he had many 
wives." <a href="../jg/8.html#30">8:30</a>

<p><li>Abimelech kills 70 brothers "upon one stone." (He was trying to get in the Guinness Book of World Records.) 
 <a href="../jg/9.html#5">9:5</a>
 
<p><li>When "the spirit of the Lord" comes upon Jephthah, he makes a deal with God: If God will help him kill the
Ammonites, then he (Jephthah) will offer to God as a burnt offering whatever comes out of his house to greet him.
God keeps his end of the deal by providing Jephthah with "a very great slaughter." But when Jephthah returns, his
nameless daughter comes out to greet him (who'd he expect, his wife?). Well, a deal's a deal, so he delivers her to
God as a burnt offering -- after letting her spend a couple of months going up and down on the mountains bewailing
her virginity.  <a href="../jg/11.html#29">11:29-39</a>

<p><li>"Her father ... did with her according to his vow which he had vowed." <a href="../jg/11.html#39">11:39</a>

<p><li>"Samson ... saw a woman ... of the daughters of the Philistines ... And Samson said unto his father ... 
Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well." <a href="../jg/14.html#1">14:1-3</a>

<p><li>After ripping up the lion, Samson went to visit the Philistine woman that he fell in lust with earlier. "And she pleased Samson well." 
<a href="../jg/14.html#7">14:7</a>

<p><li>"But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend." <a href="../jg/14.html#20">14:20</a>

<p><li>Samson's father-in-law gave Samson's wife away to a friend, since he thought Samson "hated" her. He suggests
that Samson take his younger daughter instead, saying the younger one's prettier anyway. <a href="../jg/15.html#2">15:2</a>

<p><li>"Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her." 
<a href="../jg/16.html#1">16:1</a>

<p><li>"Afterward ... he loved a woman ... whose name was Delilah." <a href="../jg/16.html#4">16:4</a>

<p><li>After taking in a traveling Levite, the host offers his virgin daughter and his guest's concubine to a mob of
perverts (who want to have sex with his guest). The mob refuses the daughter, but accepts the concubine and they
"abuse her all night." The next morning she crawls back to the doorstep and dies. The Levite puts her dead body on an
ass and takes her home. Then he chops her body up into twelve pieces and sends them to each of the twelve tribes of
Israel.  <a href="../jg/19.html#22">19:22-30</a>

<p><li>After the Israelites heard the Levite's story (about chopping up his dead concubine and sending her body parts to each 
tribe of Israel) they vowed not to "give" their daughters to the Benjamites. So now they had a problem: they just finished 
killing all the Benjamite women and children (<a href="../jg/20.html#48">Jg 20:48</a>) so there were no women for the surviving Benjamite men to marry. 
[There were 600 Benjamite men that survived the war with the Israelites. (<a href="../jg/20.html#47">Jg 20:47</a>)]  
<a href="../jg/21.html#1">21:1-7</a>  

<p><li>To find wives for the Benjamites (they were unwilling to use their own daughters), the other tribes attacked
and killed all occupants of a city except for the young virgins. These virgins were then given to the Benjamites for
wives.  <a href="../jg/21.html#7">21:7-23</a>

<p><li>Here's what the Israelites decide to do. They will go and kill everyone in Jabeshgilead except for the virgin 
women and give them to the 600 surviving Benjamites. <a href="../jg/21.html#11">21:11</a>

<p><li>So the Israelites killed all the non-virgin women and children in Jabeshgilead, bringing back 400 virgin women 
to give to the Benjamites. But they were still 200 short. Damn! <a href="../jg/21.html#12">21:12-14</a>

<p><li>Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are 
destroyed out of Benjamin?" <a href="../jg/21.html#16">21:16</a>

<p><li>So they come up with another brilliant plan. Have the Benjamites hide in the bushes and then catch the daughters 
of Shiloh when they come out to dance. So that's what they did and everyone lived happily ever after.  <a href="../jg/21.html#19">21:19-23</a>

<a href="../ru/3.html#7">3:7-9</a>

<p><li>Boaz seems agreeable to the suggestion and says, "I will do thee all that thou requirest." Next he asks her to
"Tarry this night ... lie down until the morning." so Ruth "lay at his feet until morning." 
<a href="../ru/3.html#11">3:11-14</a>

<p><li>"He [Samuel's father] had two wives." <a href="../1sam/1.html#2">1:2</a>

<p><li>"The Lord had shut up her [Hannah's] womb." <a href="../1sam/1.html#5">1:5</a>

<p><li>The sons of Eli had sex with women "at the door of the tabernacle."  <a href="../1sam/2.html#22">2:22</a>

<p><li>"A man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the
    LORD ... I will cut off thine arm... There shall not be an old man in thine house for ever ... I shall ... 
    consume thine eyes and ... grieve thine heart."<br>
A "man of God" tells Eli  that God will "consume his eyes" and "grieve his heart" and make sure that all of his decendants will 
die young" because of the stuff his sons did. <a href="../1sam/2.html#27">2:27-32</a>

<p><li>"And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die 
both of them."<br>
God says he'll kill his two sons as a sign to him. (Just ot remind him of the nasty things he plans to do to him and his 
descendants to punish him for what his sons did.) <a href="../1sam/2.html#34">2:34</a>

<p><li>God will punish Eli's descendants forever for the sins of Eli's sons. <a href="../1sam/3.html#12">3:12-13</a>

 <p><li>Samuel tells Eli that God will punish his descendants forever (<a href="../1sam/3.html#12">3:12-13</a>) and Eli says, 
  "Okay, whatever God wants is fine with me." <a href="../1sam/3.html#18">3:18</a>

<p><li>"The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain."<br>
    God killed Eli's sons as he promised to do. (See <a href="../1sam/2.html#25">2:25</a> and <a href="../1sam/2.html#34">34</a>) <a href="../1sam/4.html#11">4:11</a>

<p><li>God orders Saul to kill all of the Amalekites: men, women, infants, sucklings, ox, sheep, camels, and asses.
Why? Because God remembers what Amalek did hundreds of years ago.  <a href="../1sam/15.html#2">15:2-3</a>

<p><li>Saul killed everyone but Agag (the king) and the best of the animals. But still God was furious with Saul for
not killing everything as he had been told to do. He said, "it repenteth me that I have set Saul up to be king." 
 <a href="../1sam/15.html#7">15:7-26</a>
 
  <p><li>Saul is rebuked by Samuel for "doing evil in the sight of the Lord" by failing to kill all of the 
Amalekites. <a href="../1sam/15.html#18">15:18-19</a>

<p><li>Because Saul didn't kill everyone as God commanded, God changes his mind about him 
being king. <a href="../1sam/15.html#23">15:23-26</a>

<p><li>David kills 200 Philistines and brings their foreskins to Saul to buy his first wife (Saul's daughter Michal).
Saul had only asked for 100 foreskins, but David was feeling generous.  <a href="../1sam/18.html#25">18:25-27</a>

<p><li>Saul kills 85 priests of Nob and all men, women, children, and animals in the city of Nob.  <a href="../1sam/22.html#18">22:18-19</a>

<p><li>"And it came to pass about ten days after, that the Lord smote Nabal, that he died." This was convenient for
David who then took his property and his wife, Abigail.  <a href="../1sam/25.html#38">25:38</a>

<p><li>"When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD ... And David sent and communed with Abigail, 
to take her to him to wife." <a href="../1sam/25.html#39">25:39</a>

<p><li>David takes his second wife (Abigail) after God killed her husband (Nabal). He also, at the same time,
took another wife (#3), Abinam. In the meantime, Saul gave Michal (his daughter and David's first wife) to another
man.  <a href="../1sam/25.html#41">25:41-44</a>

<p><li> "And David smote the land and left neither man nor woman alive." (No wonder God liked David so much!)
<a href="../1sam/27.html#8">27:8-11</a>

<p><li>"David went up thither, and his two wives also." <a href="../2sam/2.html#2">2:2</a>

<p><li>David, by this time, has at least seven wives (Michal, Ahinoam, Abigail, Maacah, Haggith, Abital, and Ehlah),
and he was just getting started.  <a href="../2sam/3.html#2">3:2-5</a>

<p><li>David says, "deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines."
Well, he actually paid with two hundred foreskins (see <a href="../1sam/18.html#27">1 Samuel 18:27</a>).  
<a href="../2sam/3.html#14">3:14</a>

<p><li>Michal was bought by David with 200 Philistine foreskins 
(<A href="../1sam/18.html#25">1 Sam 18:25-27</A>), then she was "given" 
to Phatiel (<A href="../1sam/25.html#44">1 Sam 25:44</A>), and then "taken back" by David. 
Poor Phatiel must have loved her dearly since he "went along weeping behind her." 
<a href="../2sam/3.html#15">3:15-16</a>

<p><li>"And David took him more concubines and wives." (How many? God knows I suppose, but he doesn't tell us in
the Bible.)  <a href="../2sam/5.html#13">5:13</a>

<p><li>King David dances nearly naked in front of God and everybody. When Michal criticizes him for exposing himself, God punishes her by
having "no child unto the day of her death." Although <A href="../2sam/21.html#8">21:8</A> says that she had five sons (which were sacrificed 
to God by David to stop God from starving people to death). <a href="../2sam/6.html#14">6:14-23</a>

<p><li>David sees a woman (Bathsheba) bathing and likes what he sees. so he sends for her and commits adultery
with her "for she was purified from her uncleanness." She conceives and bears a son (of course).  
<a href="../2sam/11.html#2">11:2-5</a>

<p><li>David tells Joab (his captain) to send Bathsheba's husband (Uriah) to "the forefront of the hottest battle
... that he may be smitten and die." In this way, David gets another wife.  <a href="../2sam/11.html#15">11:15</a>, 
<a href="../2sam/11.html#17">11:17-27</a>

<p><li>God gave the wives of King Saul to David. <a href="../2sam/12.html#7">12:7-8</a>

<p><li>God is angry at David for having Uriah killed. As a punishment, he will have David's wives raped by his
neighbor while everyone else watches. It turns out that the "neighbor" that God sends to do his dirty work is David's
own son, Absalom (<a href="../2sam/16.html#22">16:22</a>).  <a href="../2sam/12.html#11">12:11-12</a>

<p><li>To punish David for having Uriah killed, God kills Bathsheba's baby boy.  <a href="../2sam/12.html#14">12:14-18</a>
<p><li>After Bathsheba's baby is killed by God, David comforts her by going "in unto her." She conceives and bears
another son (Solomon).  <a href="../2sam/12.html#24">12:24</a>

<p><li>Ammon (David's son) says to his half-sister Tamar, "Come lie with me, my sister." But she resists, so he
rapes her and then sends her away. Tamar, knowing that she now belongs to him (since she was a virgin), expects him
to marry her, but he refuses.  <a href="../2sam/13.html#1">13:1-22</a>

<p><li>"When king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth."<br>
The <a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/nrs/2-samuel/13-21.html">New Revised Standard Version adds</a>, "but he would not punish 
his son Amnon, because he loved him, for he was his firstborn."<br>
David loved Ammon "because he was his firstborn" (good parents love their firstborn sons more than their other kids). As 
<a href="http://www.thebricktestament.com/king_david/davids_son_rapes_davids_daughter/2s13_21b.html">the Brick Testament suggests</a>, 
he probably said something like, "Oh well, I guess firstborns are entitled to one free incestuous rape." <a href="../2sam/13.html#21">13:21</a>  

<p><li>Absalom "went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel." This was according the God's plan
as announced in <a href="../2sam/12.html#11">12:11-12</a>.  <a href="../2sam/16.html#21">16:21-22</a>

<p><li>"And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house."</i><br>
David left Jerusalem because he was afraid that his son Absalom was going to kill him. But he left his 
concubines to fend for themselves.  <a href="../2sam/15.html#16">15:16</a>

<p><li>Absalom "went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel." This was according the God's plan
as announced in <a href="../2sam/2.html#11">2 Sam.12:11-12</a>.  <a href="../2sam/16.html#21">16:21-22</a>

<p><li>To punish his ten concubines for
being raped by his son, Absalom (See <a href="../2sam/16.html#21">16:21-22</a>), 
David refuses to ever again have sex with them and forces them to 
"keep house" for the rest of their lives. <a href="../2sam/20.html#3">20:3</a>

<p><li>To appease God and end the famine that was caused by his predecessor (Saul), David agrees to have two of Saul's sons and five 
of his grandsons killed and hung up "unto the Lord."  <a href="../2sam/21.html#6">21:6-9</a>

<p><li>"They hanged them in the hill before the LORD." <a href="../2sam/21.html#9">21:9</a>

<p><li>"They gathered the bones of them that were hanged ... And after that God was intreated for the land."<br>
God stopped the famine after Saul's two sons and five grandsons were killed and hung up for him. <a href="../2sam/21.html#13">21:13-14</a>

<p><li>"He [Solomon] had seven hundred wives ... and three hundred concubines." <a href="../1kg/11.html#3">11:3</a>

<p><li>"In thy days I will not do it for David thy father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son."<br>
God is angry with Solomon, but decides to punish Solomon's son rather than Solomon himself, because he liked Solomon's 
father (David) so darned much. <a href="../1kg/11.html#11">11:11-12</a>

To punish Jeroboam for making gold calves, God killed his son.  <a href="../1kg/14.html#17">14:17</a>

<p><li>"I will ... make thy house like the house of Jeroboam. Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; 
and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat."<br>
God says he's going to kill Baasha's family (like he did Jeroboam's). <a href="../1kg/16.html#3">16:3-4</a>

<p><li>"He slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, 
nor of his friends. Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD."<br> 
Zimri kills everyone "that <a href="../topics/piss.html">pisseth
against a wall</a> ... according to the word of the Lord." <a href="../1kg/16.html#11">16:11-12</a>

<p><li>"He laid the foundation  thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his
    youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD."<br>
When Hiel rebuilds Jericho, he lays the foundation with the body of his oldest son and sets up the gates with his
youngest son's body "according to the word of the Lord."<br>
Did God want Hiel to sacrifice his sons in this way? Did he make him do it? What does "according to the word of the Lord" mean here?
  <a href="../1kg/16.html#34">16:34</a>
  
<p><li>"Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: 
but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house."<br>
Since Ahab humbles himself before the Lord, God decides not to bring evil on him; he'll 
<a href="../2kg/9.html#24" title="2Kg 9:24-25">he'll bring it on Ahab's son</a> instead. <a href="../1kg/21.html#29">21:29</a>

<p><li>King Ahasuerus throws a party and encourages his guests to drink to excess. Then, when they are all drunk, he orders
Queen Vashti to show her stuff before him and his guests.  <a href="../est/1.html#7">1:7-11</a>

<p><li>Vashti refuses to entertain the king's drunken guests by dancing before them. For this she is no longer to be queen,
to be replaced by someone better (prettier?).  <a href="../est/1.html#12">1:12-19</a>

<p><li>Because of Vashti's disobedience, the king decrees that "all the wives shall give to their husbands honor, both the
great and the small" and "that every man should bear rule over his own house."  
<a href="../est/1.html#20">1:20-22</a>

<p><li>"All the fair young virgins" throughout the kingdom are brought before the king, and the one that "pleaseth" the
king the most will replace Vashti. <a href="../est/2.html#2">2:2-4</a>

<p><li>When it was Esther turn to "go in unto the king," she pleases the king the most. So, having won the sex
contest, she is made queen in Vashti's place.  <a href="../est/2.html#8">2:8-9, 12-17</a>

<p><li>At Esther's request, the king orders a preemptive strike on all 127 provinces from Egypt to Ethiopia. Everyone who planned 
    to kill Jews shall be killed by Jews, along with their wives and children. And all this killing is to take place on a single day. <br>
    (How are the Jews to figure out who planned to kill them and who didn't? Were they supposed to just kill them all and let God sort it out? 
    And why did they need to kill the women and children?)  <a href="../est/8.html#9">8:9-11</a>
    
<p><li>The Jews kill everyone who ever had a bad thought toward them, along with their Jew-hating families. <a href="../est/9.html#1">9:1-16</a>  

<p><li>"The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they." <a href="../est/9.html#10">9:10</a>

<p><li>"The king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed
    five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman ... what is thy request further? ... 
    Then said Esther ... let Haman's ten sons be hanged."  <br>
        Esther tells the king to hang the already dead bodies of Haman's ten sons on trees. Why? Would they make nice decorations? To show everyong 
    what will happen to your children if you try to mistreat Jews? <a href="../est/9.html#12">9:12-14</a>

children are killed in a windstorm while partying. <a href="../job/1.html#13">1:13-19</a>

<p><li>God kills (or allows Satan to kill) Job's children, but Job doesn't "foolishly" blame 
God. Since God was responsible, why would it be foolish to blame God? <a href="../job/1.html#20">1:20-22</a>

<p><li> After God and Satan get done tormenting Job, God gave Job even more stuff than he had before, including 
children. God gave Job another set of 10 kids, with even prettier daughters! <a href="../job/42.html#13">42:13-15</a>

 <p><li>God sent a plague on the Israelites for "committing whoredom with the daughters of Moab." But 
"then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment [by throwing a spear through a newly married couple]: 
and so the plague was stayed." But not before 24,000 (<a href="../1cor/10.html#8">1 Corinthians 10:8</a>

<a href="../ps/106.html#29">106:29-30</a>

<p><li>The psalmist asks God to do all sorts of unpleasant things to his enemies. "Set thou a wicked man over
him; and let Satan stand at his right hand .... Let his prayer become sin." He asks God to take away his possessions,
kill him, and have his children suffer for the sins of their fathers.

<a href="../ps/109.html#12">109:12</a>

<p><li>"Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them."<br>
        A man should have as many children as he can. To hell with birth control. <a href="../ps/127.html#3">127:3-5</a>

<p><li>God is praised for slaughtering kings, nations, and little babies.  
<a href="../ps/135.html#8">135:8, 10</a>

<p><li> God kills Ezekiel's wife and then tells him not to mourn her.  <a href="../ezek/24.html#15">24:16-18</a>

<p><li> God killed Ezekiel's wife to demonstrate his intention to kill the Israelites' children. And just as God told Ezekiel not to mourn his wife's death, 
God forbids the parents to mourn the death of their children. <a href="../ezek/24.html#21">24:21-24</a>

<p><li>God tells Hosea to commit adultery, saying &quot;take ... a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms&quot; because the land has &quot;committed great
whoredom.&quot; So Hosea did as God commanded and &quot;took&quot; a wife named Gomer.

<p><li> God (or Hosea?) tells his children that their mother is a whore who is not his wife. He asks 
them to tell their mother to "put away her whoredoms" and  "her adulteries from between her breasts" or 
he'll "strip her naked ... and slay her with thirst." <a href="../hos/2.html#2">2:2-3</a>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="43932" endspan --><p><b><a href="../mt/fv_list.html">Matthew</a></b>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../mt/fv.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->
<p><li>Jesus tells a man who had just lost his father: "Let the dead bury the dead."  <a href="../mt/8.html#21">8:21</a>

<p><li>Families will be torn apart because of Jesus (this is one of the few "prophecies" in the Bible that has actually come
true). "Brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents,
and cause them to be put to death."  <a href="../mt/10.html#21">10:21</a>

<p><li>Jesus says that he has come to destroy families by making family members hate each other. He has "come not to
send peace, but a sword."  <a href="../mt/10.html#34">10:34-36</a>

<p><li>Jesus warns us not to love our parents or children too much. We have to make sure that we always love him (who we
don't even know existed) more than our family.  <a href="../mt/10.html#37">10:37</a>

<p><li>When Jesus' mother and brothers want to see him, Jesus rudely asks, "Who is my mother? Who are my
brothers?"  So much for Jesus' family values.  <a href="../mt/12.html#47">12:47-49</a>

<p><li>Jesus is criticized by the Pharisees for not
washing his hands before eating. He defends himself by attacking them for not
killing disobedient children according to the commandment: &quot;He that curseth
father or mother, let him die the death.&quot; (See <A href="../ex/21.html#15">Ex 21:15</A>,
<A href="../lev/20.html#9">Lev 20:9</A>, <A href="../dt/21.html#18">Dt 21:18-21</A>) 
So, does Jesus think that children who curse their parents should be killed? It 
sure sounds like it. <a href="../mt/15.html#4">15:4-7</a>

<p><li>In the parable of the unforgiving servant, the king threatens to enslave a man and his entire family to pay for a debt. 
This practice, which was common at the time, seems not to have bothered Jesus very much.
The parable ends with this: "So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you." If you are cruel to others, 
God will be cruel to you. <a href="../mt/18.html#23">18:23-35</a>

<p><li>"It is not good to marry."<br>
After Jesus denounces divorce, his disciples say that if divorce isn't allowed, then &quot;it is good not to 
marry.&quot; Jesus agrees by saying that it is better to make yourself a eunuch
&quot;for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him
receive it.&quot;  <a href="../mt/19.html#10">19:10</a>
 
<p><li>Abandon your wife and children for Jesus and he'll give you a big reward.  <a href="../mt/19.html#29">19:29</a>

<p><li>There are no marriages in heaven. (Married people either don't go to heaven or they get divorced 
after arriving there. Marriages aren't made in heaven; they die there.) <a href="../mt/22.html#23">22:23-30</a>

<p><li>Jesus tells us to &quot;call no man your
father upon the earth.&quot; Not even dear old dad? How can we &quot;honor our father&quot; if we 
refuse to call him our father? <a href="../mt/23.html#9">23:9</a>

<p><li>"Woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days." Why? Does God especially hate
pregnant and nursing women?  <a href="../mt/24.html#19">24:19</a>

<p><li>The kingdom of heaven like ten virgins who went to meet their bridegroom. Five had oil for their lamps and five didn't. 
When the bridegroom was ready for them, only the five well-oiled virgins got to have sex with him on their wedding night. 
The bridegroom shunned the other five, saying "Get lost. I don't even know you." The moral to the story is this: watch out, 
you never know when (or with whom) Jesus will come.<a href="../mt/25.html#1">25:1-13</a>

<p><li>When Jesus' parents begin the long trip back to Nazareth, the twelve year old Jesus stays behind, without
even asking for their permission. Mary and Joseph search for him for three days and when they finally find him, Jesus
doesn't apologize. Rather, he blames them for not knowing that he was doing his real father's business. 
 <a href="../lk/2.html#43">2:43-49</a>
 
<p><li>Peter, James, and John leave everything (including their families) to follow Jesus. 
(See <a href="../lk/4.html#38">4:38</a> for reference to Peter's wife.) <a href="../lk/5.html#11">5:11</a>

mother and brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.  <a href="../lk/8.html#20">8:20-21</a>

<p><li>Jesus won't even let his followers bury their dead parents or say farewell to their families before abandoning
them.  <a href="../lk/9.html#59">9:59-62</a>

<p><li>Jesus insults his mother (the Most Holy Blessed Virgin Mary). <a href="../lk/11.html#27">11:27-28</a>

<p><li>Jesus prophesies that families will be divided because of him and his teachings. Sadly, this is one prophecy
that has been fulfilled.  <a href="../lk/12.html#52">12:52-53</a>

<p><li>Jesus says that his disciples must hate their families (mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, husbands, wives,
children) and themselves.  <a href="../lk/14.html#26">14:26</a>

<p><li>If you want to be a disciple of Jesus, you must abandon everything, including your family.

<p><li>Abandon your wife and family for Jesus and he'll give you a big reward.  
<a href="../lk/18.html#29">18:29-30</a>

<p><li>Jesus says that everyone in heaven is single. Does that mean that married people can't go there, that they must
get a divorce once they arrive, or what? <a href="../lk/20.html#2">20:27-35</a>

<p><li>"Ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks."<br>
