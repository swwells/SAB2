"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",

"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",

have ye not observed the steadiness of thy brother, his faithfulness, and his diligence in keeping the commandments 
of God?  Behold, has he not set a good example for thee? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>39:2</b>   For thou didst not give so much heed unto my words as did thy brother, among the people of the 
Zoramites.  Now this is what I have against thee; thou didst go on unto boasting in thy strength and thy wisdom. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>39:3</b>   And this is not all, my son.  Thou didst do that which was grievous unto me; for thou didst forsake 
the ministry, and did go over into the land of Siron, among the borders of the Lamanites, after the harlot Isabel. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>39:4</b>   Yea, she did steal away the hearts of many; but this was no excuse for thee, my son.  Thou shouldst 
have tended to the ministry wherewith thou wast entrusted. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>39:5</b>   Know ye not, my son, that <span class="i">these things are an abomination in the sight of the Lord;
 yea, most abominable above all sins save it be</span> the shedding of innocent blood or <span class="i">denying the Holy 
 Ghost</span>? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">Denying the Holy Ghost (refusing to become Mormon or escaping from Mormonism?) is the greatest 
abomination and is unpardonable.</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>39:6</b>   For behold, <span class="i">if ye deny the Holy Ghost when it once has had place in you, and ye know that ye deny 
it, behold, this is a sin which is unpardonable</span>; yea, and whosoever murdereth against the light and knowledge of 
God, it is not easy for him to obtain forgiveness; yea, I say unto you, my son, that it is not easy for him to 
obtain a forgiveness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>39:7</b>   And now, my son, I would to God that ye had not been guilty of so great a crime.  I would not dwell 
upon your crimes, to harrow up your soul, if it were not for your good. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>39:8</b>   But behold, ye cannot hide your crimes from God; and except ye repent they will stand as a testimony 
against you at the last day. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>39:9</b>   Now my son, I would that ye should repent and forsake your sins, and go no more 
after <span class="plag">the lusts of 
your eyes</span>, but cross yourself in all these things; for except ye do this ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of 
God.  Oh, remember, and take it upon you, and cross yourself in these things. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>39:10</b>   And I command you to take it upon you to counsel with your elder brothers in your undertakings; for 
behold, thou art in thy youth, and ye stand in need to be nourished by your brothers.   And give heed to their 
counsel. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>39:11</b>   Suffer not yourself to be led away by any vain or foolish thing; suffer not the devil to lead 
away your heart again after those wicked harlots.  Behold, O my son, how great iniquity ye brought upon the 
Zoramites; for when they saw your conduct they would not believe in my words. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>39:12</b>   And now the Spirit of the Lord doth say unto me: Command thy children to do good, lest they lead 
away the hearts of many people to destruction; therefore I command you, my son, in the fear of God, that ye refrain 
from your iniquities; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>39:13</b>   That ye turn to the Lord with all your mind, might, and strength; that ye lead away the 
hearts of no more to do wickedly; but rather return unto them, and acknowledge your faults and that wrong 
which ye have done. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>39:14</b>   Seek not after riches nor the vain things of this world; for behold, you cannot carry them 
with you. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>39:15</b>   And now, my son, I would say somewhat unto you concerning the coming of Christ.  Behold, I 
say unto you, that it is he that surely shall come to take away the sins of the world; yea, he cometh to 
declare glad tidings of salvation unto his people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>39:16</b>   And now, my son, this was the ministry unto which ye were called, to declare these glad tidings 
unto this people to prepare their minds; or rather that salvation might come unto them, that they may prepare the 
minds of their children to hear the word at the time of his coming. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>39:17</b>   And now I will ease your mind somewhat on this subject.   Behold, you marvel why these things 
should be known so long beforehand.  Behold, I say unto you, is not a soul at this time as precious unto God as 
a soul will be at the time of his coming? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>39:18</b>   Is it not as necessary that the plan of redemption should be made known unto this people as well 
as unto their children? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>39:19</b>   Is it not as easy at this time for the Lord to send his angel to declare these glad tidings 
unto us as unto our children, or as after the time of his coming? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
