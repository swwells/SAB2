<H3>Giants in the bible</H3>
<ol>
<p><li>"There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the 
daughters of men...." <a href="../gen/6.html#4">Genesis 6:4</a><br>
<p>This is one of the most interesting verses in the bible. Who were "the sons of God" who had sex with "the 
daughters of men"? Jesus and his long-lost brothers? Sex-crazed angels from hell? The bible doesn't say, but whoever 
they were, they seemed to have pissed off God. Because in the very next verse, he decides to kill every living thing 
that he had made.
<p><li>"And there we saw the giants ... And we were in our own sight as grasshopper, and so we were in their sight." 
<a href="../num/13.html#33">Numbers 13:33</a>
<p>These are the same giants (the Nephilium) mentioned in <a href="../gen/6.html#4">Genesis 6:4</a>. Somehow they 
managed to survive the flood, <a href="../contra/flood_die.html">contrary to Gen.7:21</a>.
<p><li>"The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; Which also were accounted 
giants...." <a href="../dt/2.html#10">Deuteronomy 2:10-11</a>
<p><li>That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call
    them Zamzummims; A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them. 
    <a href="../dt/2.html#20">Dt.2:20-21</a> 
<p><li>For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold his bedstead was a bedstead of
    iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine <a href="#cubit">cubits</a> was the length thereof, and four 
    <a href="#cubit">cubits<a> the
    breadth of it. <a href="../dt/3.html#11">Dt.3:11</a>
<p>Og's bed was nine <a href="#cubit">cubits</a> long -- large enough for a 4 meter-long giant.
<p><li>"And the coast of Og king of Bashan, which as of the remnant of the giants ..." <a href="../jos/12.html#4">Joshua 12:4</a>, 
<a href="../jos/18.html#16">18:16</a>
<p><li>"Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six <a href="#cubit">cubits</a> and a span." (10 ft, 3 m) <a href="../1sam/17.html#4">1 Sam.17:4</a>

<p><li>Among those killed by the "mighty man", Benaiah, was an Egyptian "five 
<a href="#cubit">cubits</a> high" (7.5 
ft, 2.3 m). 
<a href="../1chr/11.html#23">1 Chr.11:23</a> 

<p><li>God destroyed the Amorites who were a race of gaints as tall 
as cedars and as strong as oaks. <a href="../am/2.html#9">Amos 2:9</a>
</ol>

<a name="cubit"></a>(A cubit is about 18 inches in length; a span is about 9 inches)
