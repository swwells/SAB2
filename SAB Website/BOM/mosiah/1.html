<a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a><br> (1:2, 9, 15, 18)

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (1:1-5) King Benjamin taught his sons Reformed Egyptian so they could read the brass plates. Good thing, too -- 
otherwise they'd suffer ignorance and dwindle in unbelief. 

<p>(1:1-2) <i>"King Benjamin ... had three sons ... Mosiah, and Helorum, and Helaman.  
And he caused that they should be taught in all the language of his fathers."</i>

<p>(1:3) <i>"And he also taught them concerning the records which were engraven on the plates of brass, saying: My sons ... 
were it not for these plates ... we must have suffered in ignorance."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (1:4) <br><i>"Lehi ... having been taught in the language of the Egyptians."</i><br>
Lehi, a 7th century BCE Israelite, was fluent in Reformed Egyptian.

<p>(1:5) <i>"Were it not for these things ... our fathers would have 
<a href="diu_list.html">dwindled in unbelief</a>."</i>

</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>1:1</b>   And now there was no more contention in all the land of Zarahemla, among all the people who belonged to 
king Benjamin, so that <span class="a">king Benjamin</span> had continual peace all the remainder of his days. 

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>1:2</b>   <span class="a"><span class="a">And it came to pass</span></span> that he 
	<span class="a">had three sons</span>; and he called their names
	<span class="a">Mosiah, and Helorum, and Helaman.  
And he caused that they should be taught in all the language of his fathers</span>, that thereby they might become men of 
understanding; and that they might know concerning the prophecies which had been spoken by the mouths of their fathers, 
which were delivered them by the hand of the Lord. 

<tr><td><b><a name="3:"></a>1:3</b>   <span class="a">And he also taught them concerning the records 
which were engraven on the plates of brass</span>, saying: My sons, I would that ye should remember that 
	<span class="a">were it not for these 
plates,</span> which contain these records and these commandments, 
	<span class="a">we must have suffered in ignorance</span>, even at this present 
time, not knowing the mysteries of God. 

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>1:4</b>   For it were not possible that our father, <span class="a">Lehi</span>, could have 
remembered all these things, to have taught them to his children, except it were for the help of these plates; for he 
<span class="a">having been taught in the language of the Egyptians</span> therefore he could read these engravings, and teach them to his 
children, that thereby they could teach them to their children, and so fulfilling the commandments of God, even down to 
this present time. 

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>1:5</b>   I say unto you, my sons, <span class="a">were it not for these things</span>, which have been kept and preserved by the hand 
of God, that we might read and understand of his mysteries, and have his commandments always before our eyes, that 
even our fathers would have <span class="a">dwindled in unbelief</span>, and we should have been like unto our brethren, the Lamanites, who 
know nothing concerning these things, or even do not believe them when they are taught them, because of the traditions 
of their fathers, which are not correct. 

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>1:6</b>   O my sons, I would that ye should remember that <span class="c">these sayings are true, and also that these records are 
true.  And behold, also the plates of Nephi</span>, which contain the records and the sayings of our fathers from the time 
they left Jerusalem until now, and they <span class="a">are true;</span> and we can know of their surety because we have them before our 
eyes. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

he saw that he must very soon go the way of all the earth; therefore, he thought it expedient that he should confer 
the kingdom upon one of his sons. 

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>1:10</b>   Therefore, he had Mosiah brought before him; and these are the words which he spake unto him, 
	saying: My son, I would that ye should make a proclamation throughout all this land among all this people, or the people of Zarahemla, and the people of Mosiah who dwell in the land, that thereby they may be gathered together; for on the 
morrow I shall proclaim unto this my people out of mine own mouth that thou art a king and a ruler over this people, 
whom the Lord our God hath given us. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>1:11</b>   And moreover, I shall give this people a name, that thereby they may be distinguished above all the 
people which the Lord God hath brought out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I do because they have been a diligent 
people in keeping the commandments of the Lord. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>1:12</b>   And I give unto them <span class="plag">a name that never shall be blotted out</span>,

transgression, and become a wicked and an adulterous people, that the Lord will deliver them up, that thereby they 
become weak like unto their brethren; and he will no more preserve them by his matchless and marvelous power, as he 
has hitherto preserved our fathers. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>1:14</b>   For I say unto you, that if he had not extended his arm in the preservation of our fathers they must
