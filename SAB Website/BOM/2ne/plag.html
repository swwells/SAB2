<p><li>And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not;
    and see ye indeed, but perceive not. -- <a href="../../is/6.html#9">Isaiah 6:9</a><br>
    <a href="16.html#9">16:9</a> 
    
<p><li>Make the heart of this
    people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see
    with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart,
    and convert, and be healed. -- <a href="../../is/6.html#10">Isaiah 6:10</a><br>
    <a href="16.html#10">16:10</a> 
    
<p><li>Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted
    without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly
    desolate, -- <a href="../../is/6.html#11">Isaiah 6:11</a><br>
    <a href="16.html#11">16:11</a> 
    
<p><li>And the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in
    the midst of the land. -- <a href="../../is/6.html#12">Isaiah 6:12</a><br>
    <a href="16.html#12">16:12</a> 
    
<p><li>But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten:
    as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast
    their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof. --

    <a href="16.html#13">16:13</a> 

<p><li>And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of
    Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of
    Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but
    could not prevail against it. <a href="17.html#1">17:1</a> (<a href="../../is/7.html#1">Isaiah 7:1</a>) 
    
<p><li>And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with
    Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees
    of the wood are moved with the wind. <a href="17.html#2">17:2</a> (<a href="../../is/7.html#2">Isaiah 7:2</a>) 
    
<p><li>Then said the LORD unto
    Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shearjashub thy son, at the
    end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field; <a href="17.html#3">17:3</a> 
    (<a href="../../is/7.html#3">Isaiah 7:3</a>) 
    
<p><li>And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two
    tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria,
    and of the son of Remaliah. <a href="17.html#4">17:4</a> (<a href="../../is/7.html#4">Isaiah 7:4</a>) 
    
<p><li>Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel
    against thee, saying, <a href="17.html#5">17:5</a> (<a href="../../is/7.html#5">Isaiah 7:5</a>) 
    
<p><li>Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein
    for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal: <a href="17.html#6">17:6</a> 
    (<a href="../../is/7.html#6">Isaiah 7:6</a>) 
    
<p><li>Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass. <a href="17.html#7">17:7</a> 
(<a href="../../is/7.html#7">Isaiah 7:7</a>) 

<p><li>For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and
    within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a
    people. <a href="17.html#8">17:8</a> (<a href="../../is/7.html#8">Isaiah 7:8</a>) 
    
<p><li>And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's
    son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.  <a href="17.html#9">17:9</a> 
    (<a href="../../is/7.html#9">Isaiah 7:9</a>) 
    
<p><li>Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying, <a href="17.html#10">17:10</a> 
(<a href="../../is/7.html#10">Isaiah 7:10</a>) 

<p><li>Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the
    height above. <a href="17.html#11">17:11</a> (<a href="../../is/7.html#11">Isaiah 7:11</a>) 
    
<p><li>But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD. <a href="17.html#12">17:12</a> 
(<a href="../../is/7.html#12">Isaiah 7:12</a>) 

<p><li>And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to
    weary men, but will ye weary my God also?  <a href="17.html#13">17:13</a> 
    (<a href="../../is/7.html#13">Isaiah 7:13</a>) 
    
<p><li>Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall
    conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. <a href="17.html#14">17:14</a> 
    (<a href="../../is/7.html#14">Isaiah 7:14</a>) 
    
<p><li>Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and
    choose the good. <a href="17.html#15">17:15</a> (<a href="../../is/7.html#15">Isaiah 7:15</a>) 
    
<p><li>For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good,
    the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings. <a href="17.html#16">17:16</a> 
    (<a href="../../is/7.html#16">Isaiah 7:16</a>) 
    
<p><li>The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's
    house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from
    Judah; even the king of Assyria.  <a href="17.html#17">17:17</a> (<a href="../../is/7.html#17">Isaiah 7:17</a>) 
    
<p><li>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall hiss for the fly that is
    in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of
    Assyria. <a href="17.html#18">17:18</a> (<a href="../../is/7.html#18">Isaiah 7:18</a>) 
    
<p><li>And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys,
    and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes. <a href="17.html#19">17:19</a> 
    (<a href="../../is/7.html#19">Isaiah 7:19</a>) 
    
<p><li>In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the
    river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume
    the beard. <a href="17.html#20">17:20</a> (<a href="../../is/7.html#20">Isaiah 7:20</a>) 
    
<p><li>And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young
    cow, and two sheep; <a href="17.html#21">17:21</a> (<a href="../../is/7.html#21">Isaiah 7:21</a>) 
    
<p><li>And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give
    he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left
    in the land. <a href="17.html#22">17:22</a> (<a href="../../is/7.html#22">Isaiah 7:22</a>) 
    
<p><li>And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall be, where
    there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, it shall even be for
    briers and thorns. <a href="17.html#23">17:23</a> (<a href="../../is/7.html#23">Isaiah 7:23</a>) 
    
<p><li>With arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all the land
    shall become briers and thorns. <a href="17.html#24">17:24</a> (<a href="../../is/7.html#24">Isaiah 7:24</a>) 
    
<p><li>And on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there shall not
    come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the sending
    forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle. <a href="17.html#25">17:25</a> 
    (<a href="../../is/7.html#25">Isaiah 7:25</a>) 

<p><li>Moreover the LORD said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and write in it
    with a man's pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz. <a href="18.html#1">18:1</a> (<a href="../../is/8.html#1">Isaiah 8:1</a>) 
    
<p><li>And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and
    Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah. <a href="18.html#2">18:2</a> (<a href="../../is/8.html#2">Isaiah 8:2</a>) 
    
<p><li>And I went unto the prophetess; and she
    conceived, and bare a son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name
    Mahershalalhashbaz. <a href="18.html#3">18:2</a> (<a href="../../is/8.html#3">Isaiah 8:3</a>) 
    
<p><li>For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my
    mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away
    before the king of Assyria. <a href="18.html#4">18:4</a> (<a href="../../is/8.html#4">Isaiah 8:4</a>) 
    
<p><li>The LORD spake also unto me again, saying, <a href="18.html#5">18:5</a> (<a href="../../is/8.html#5">Isaiah 8:5</a>) 

<p><li>Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly,
    and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son; <a href="18.html#6">18:6</a> (<a href="../../is/8.html#6">Isaiah 8:6</a>) 
    
<p><li>Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the
    river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he
    shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks: <a href="18.html#7">18:7</a> 
    (<a href="../../is/8.html#7">Isaiah 8:7</a>) 
    
<p><li>And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall
    reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the
    breadth of thy land, O Immanuel. <a href="18.html#8">18:8</a> (<a href="../../is/8.html#8">Isaiah 8:8</a>) 
    
<p><li>Associate yourselves, O
    ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of
    far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces;
    gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. <a href="18.html#9">18:9</a> 
    (<a href="../../is/8.html#9">Isaiah 8:9</a>) 
    
<p><li>Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it
    shall not stand: for God is with us. <a href="18.html#10">18:10</a> (<a href="../../is/8.html#10">Isaiah 8:10</a>) 
    
<p><li>For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I
    should not walk in the way of this people, saying,  <a href="18.html#11">18:11</a> 
    (<a href="../../is/8.html#11">Isaiah 8:11</a>) 
    
<p><li>Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A
    confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid. <a href="18.html#12">18:12</a> 
    (<a href="../../is/8.html#12">Isaiah 8:12</a>) 
    
<p><li>Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him
    be your dread. <a href="18.html#13">18:13</a> (<a href="../../is/8.html#13">Isaiah 8:13</a>) 
    
<p><li>And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a
    rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to
    the inhabitants of Jerusalem. <a href="18.html#14">18:14</a> (<a href="../../is/8.html#14">Isaiah 8:14</a>) 
    
<p><li>And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared,
    and be taken. <a href="18.html#15">18:15</a> (<a href="../../is/8.html#15">Isaiah 8:15</a>) 
    
<p><li>Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples. <a href="18.html#16">18:16</a> 
(<a href="../../is/8.html#16">Isaiah 8:16</a>) 

<p><li>And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the house of
    Jacob, and I will look for him. <a href="18.html#17">18:17</a> (<a href="../../is/8.html#17">Isaiah 8:17</a>) 
    
<p><li>Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for signs and
    for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth in mount Zion. <a href="18.html#18">18:18</a> 
    (<a href="../../is/8.html#18">Isaiah 8:18</a>) 
    
<p><li>And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar
    spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people
    seek unto their God? for the living to the dead? <a href="18.html#19">18:19</a> 
    (<a href="../../is/8.html#19">Isaiah 8:19</a>) 
    
<p><li>To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word,
    it is because there is no light in them. <a href="18.html#20">18:20</a> (<a href="../../is/8.html#20">Isaiah 8:20</a>) 
    
<p><li>And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it shall
    come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves,
    and curse their king and their God, and look upward. <a href="18.html#21">18:21</a> 
    (<a href="../../is/8.html#21">Isaiah 8:21</a>) 
    
<p><li>And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and darkness,
    dimness of anguish; and they shall be driven to darkness. <a href="18.html#22">18:22</a> 
    (<a href="../../is/8.html#22">Isaiah 8:22</a>) 

<p><li>Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at
    the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,
    and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond
    Jordan, in Galilee of the nations. <a href="19.html#1">19:1</a> (<a href="../../is/9.html#1">Isaiah 9:1</a>) 
    
<p><li>The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that
    dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined. <a href="19.html#2">19:2</a> 
    (<a href="../../is/9.html#2">Isaiah 9:2</a>) 
    
<p><li>Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy: they joy
    before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they
    divide the spoil. <a href="19.html#3">19:3</a> (<a href="../../is/9.html#3">Isaiah 9:3</a>) 
    
<p><li>For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his
    shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian. <a href="19.html#4">19:4</a> 
    (<a href="../../is/9.html#4">Isaiah 9:4</a>) 
    
<p><li>For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments
    rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire. <a href="19.html#5">19:5</a> 
    (<a href="../../is/9.html#5">Isaiah 9:5</a>) 
    
<p><li>  For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government
    shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful,
    Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. <a href="19.html#6">19:6</a> 
    (<a href="../../is/9.html#6">Isaiah 9:6</a>) 
    
<p><li>Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon
    the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it
    with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of
    the LORD of hosts will perform this. <a href="19.html#7">19:7</a> (<a href="../../is/9.html#7">Isaiah 9:7</a>) 
    
<p><li>The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel. <a href="19.html#8">19:8</a> 
(<a href="../../is/9.html#8">Isaiah 9:8</a>) 

<p><li>And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria,

    (<a href="../../is/9.html#10">Isaiah 9:10</a>) 
    
<p><li>Therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and
    join his enemies together; <a href="19.html#11">19:11</a> (<a href="../../is/9.html#11">Isaiah 9:11</a>) 
    
<p><li>The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour
    Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his
    hand is stretched out still. <a href="19.html#12">19:12</a> (<a href="../../is/9.html#12">Isaiah 9:12</a>) 
    
<p><li>For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do they
    seek the LORD of hosts. <a href="19.html#13">19:13</a> (<a href="../../is/9.html#13">Isaiah 9:13</a>) 
    
<p><li>Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and
    rush, in one day. <a href="19.html#14">19:14</a> (<a href="../../is/9.html#14">Isaiah 9:14</a>) 
    
<p><li> The ancient and honourable, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth

<p><li>For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they that are led of
    them are destroyed. <a href="19.html#16">19:16</a> (<a href="../../is/9.html#16">Isaiah 9:16</a>) 

<p><li>Therefore the LORD shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall
    have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for every one is an hypocrite and
    an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not
    turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.<a href="19.html#17">19:17</a> 
    (<a href="../../is/9.html#17">Isaiah 9:17</a>) 
    
<p><li>For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers and thorns,
    and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall mount up like
    the lifting up of smoke. <a href="19.html#18">19:18</a> (<a href="../../is/9.html#18">Isaiah 9:18</a>) 
    
<p><li>Through the wrath of
    the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel
    of the fire: no man shall spare his brother <a href="19.html#19">19:19</a> (<a href="../../is/9.html#19">Isaiah 9:19</a>) 
    
<p><li>And he shall snatch
    on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and
    they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own

<p><li>Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together shall be

    stretched out still. <a href="19.html#21">19:21</a> (<a href="../../is/9.html#21">Isaiah 9:21</a>) 

<p><li>Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness
    which they have prescribed; <a href="20.html#1">20:1</a> (<a href="../../is/10.html#1">Isaiah 10:1</a>) 
    
<p><li>To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the

<p><li>O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine
    indignation. <a href="20.html#5">20:5</a> (<a href="../../is/10.html#5">Isaiah 10:5</a>) 
    
<p><li>I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of
