<p><li>Jesus believed the stupid and vicious story from <a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/num/21.html#4">Numbers 21</a>. 
(God sent snakes to bite the people for complaining about the lack of food and water. 
Then God told Moses to make a brass snake to cure them from the bites.)  <a href="3.html#14">3:14</a>

<p><li>As an example to parents everywhere and to save the world (from himself), God had his own son tortured and killed.
 <a href="3.html#16">3:16</a>
 
<p><li>People are damned or saved depending only on what they believe. 
<a href="3.html#18">3:18</a>, <a href="3.html#36">36</a>

<p><li>The "wrath of God" is on all unbelievers.  <a href="3.html#36">3:36</a>

<p><li>Jesus magically perceived that a Samaritan woman had been married and divorced five times previously. 
(He could spot a divorced woman a mile away.) Since women weren't allowed to get a divorce, it was always the woman's fault 
and divorced women were considered outcasts. This was a great opportunity for Jesus to explain why the Mosaic marriage laws
 were unjust and correct them -- if he thought they were wrong, that is, which apparently he didn't. <a href="4.html#7">4:7-18</a>

<p><li>Jesus believes people are crippled by God as a punishment for sin. He tells a crippled man, after healing him, to
"sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee."  <a href="5.html#14">5:14</a>

<p><li>Jesus knew who could stomach the idea of eating his flesh and drinking his blood (the 
    Catholics, who are going to heaven) and who couldn't (the Protestants, who are going to hell). It's all a part of God's plan 
    and we have nothing to do with it. <a href="6.html#64">6:64-66</a>

<p><li>Jesus tells his family that he wasn't going to the feast, but later goes &quot;in secret.&quot; 
 <a href="7.html#8">7:8-10</a>
 
<p><li>If you don't believe in Jesus, you will "die in your sins" (and then go to hell).  
<a href="8.html#24">8:24</a>

<p><li>Jesus calls his opponents (the Jews) the sons of the devil.  <a href="8.html#44">8:44</a>

<p><li>The disciples ask Jesus about the cause of a man's blindness. Was it because he or his parents sinned? Jesus said neither 
    had sinned. The man was born blind so that Jesus could show off his powers by curing him of his blindness.   
     <a href="9.html#1">9:1-3</a>
     
<p><li>Jesus says that he has come to make people blind.  <a href="9.html#39">9:39</a>

<p><li>"All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers." <br>
Everyone that ever lived before Jesus was a thief and a robber.  <a href="10.html#8">10:8</a>

<p><li>Lararus must suffer and die (or pretend to die) so that Jesus can &quot;be glorified&quot; by raising 
him from the dead. <a href="11.html#4">11:4</a>

<p><li>Mary wastes expensive ointment on Jesus' feet, rather than selling the ointment and 
giving the money to the poor. But Jesus thinks his feet are more important, saying that poor people will 
always be around, but he and his precious feet won&#39;t be. (According to the New Oxford Annotated Bible, 300 denarii 
would be nearly a year's wage for a laborer.) <a href="12.html#3">12:3-8</a>

<p><li>You must hate your life in order to keep it. (If you love your life, you'll go to hell after you die.)
 <a href="12.html#25">12:25</a>

<p><li>The reason people didn't believe in Jesus was that God had "blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart." God
did this so that they would not "understand with their heart, and be converted." This way God could damn more
people to hell.  <a href="12.html#40">12:40</a>

<p><li>If you don't believe in Jesus you are going to hell.  <a href="12.html#48">12:48</a>

<p><li>Jesus is the only way to heaven. All other religions lead to hell. <a href="14.html#6">14:6</a>

<p><li>"He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me:
    and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father."<br>
    If you follow Jesus' teachings, God will love you -- otherwise... well, you know.
 <a href="14.html#21">14:21</a>
 

<p><li>Those who do not believe in Jesus will be cast into a fire to be burned.  
<a href="15.html#6">15:6</a>

<p><li>Now that Jesus has come, non-believers have no excuse for not believing in him.
 <a href="15.html#22">15:22</a>
