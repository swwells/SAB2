<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>27:1</b>   <span class="a">And now it came to pass</span> that the persecutions which were inflicted on the church by the unbelievers 
became so great that the church began to murmur, and complain to their leaders concerning the matter; and they did 
complain to Alma.  And Alma laid the case before their king, Mosiah.  And Mosiah consulted with his priests. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

(27:1, 2, 10, 17, 23, 32)
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>27:2</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that king Mosiah sent a proclamation throughout the land 
round about that there should not any unbeliever persecute any of those who belonged to the church of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>27:3</b>   And there was a strict command throughout all the churches that there should be no

<span class="g">every man should esteem his neighbor as himself, laboring with their own hands for their support.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/good1.gif" >
<font size="-1">Every man should esteem his neighbor as himself.</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>27:5</b>   Yea, and all their priests and teachers should labor with their own hands for their support, in all 
cases save it were in sickness, or in much want; and doing these things, they did abound in the grace of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>27:6</b>   And there began to be much peace again in the land; and the people began to be very numerous, and 
began to scatter abroad upon the face of the earth, yea, on the north and on the south, on the east and on the west, 
building large cities and villages in all quarters of the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>27:7</b>   And the Lord did visit them and prosper them, and they became a large and wealthy people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>27:8</b>   Now the sons of Mosiah were numbered among the unbelievers; and also one of the sons of Alma was 
numbered among them, he being called Alma, after his father; nevertheless, he became a very wicked and an idolatrous 
man.  And he was a man of many words, and did speak much flattery to the people; therefore he led many of the people 
to do after the manner of his iniquities. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>27:9</b>   And he became a great hinderment to the prosperity of the church of God; stealing away the hearts 
of the people; causing much dissension among the people; giving a chance for the enemy of God to exercise his power 
over them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>27:10</b>   And now it came to pass that while he was 
going about to destroy the church of God, for he did go 
about secretly with the sons of Mosiah seeking to destroy the church, and to lead astray the people of the Lord, 
contrary to the commandments of God, or even the king --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>27:11</b>   And as I said unto you, as they were going about rebelling against God, behold, 
the angel of the Lord appeared unto them; and he descended as it were in a cloud; and he spake as it 
were with a voice of thunder, which caused the earth to shake upon which they stood; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">


<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>27:12</b>   And so great was their astonishment, that they fell to the earth, and 
understood not the words which he spake unto them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>27:13</b>   Nevertheless he cried again, saying: Alma, arise and stand forth, for 
why persecutest thou the church of God?  For the Lord hath said: This is my church, and I will establish it; and nothing shall overthrow it, save it 
is the transgression of my people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>27:14</b>   And again, the angel said: Behold, the Lord hath heard the prayers of his people, and also the 
prayers of his servant, Alma, who is thy father; for he has prayed with much faith concerning thee that thou mightest 
be brought to the knowledge of the truth; therefore, for this purpose have I come to convince thee of the power and 
authority of God, that the prayers of his servants might be answered according to their faith. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>27:15</b>   And now behold, can ye dispute the power of God?  For behold, doth not my voice shake the earth?  
And can ye not also behold me before you?  And I am sent from God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>27:16</b>   Now I say unto thee: Go, and remember the captivity of thy fathers in the land of Helam, and in the 
land of Nephi; and remember how great things he has done for them; for they were in bondage, and he has delivered 
them.  And now I say unto thee, Alma, go thy way, and seek to destroy the church no more, that their prayers may be 
answered, and this even if thou wilt of thyself be cast off. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>27:17</b>   <span class="a">And now it came to pass</span> that these were the last words which the angel spake unto Alma, and he 
departed. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>27:18</b>   And now Alma and those that were with him fell again to the earth, for great was their astonishment; 
for with their own eyes they had beheld an angel of the Lord; and his voice was as thunder, which shook the earth; and 
they knew that there was nothing save the power of God that could shake the earth and cause it to tremble as though 
it would part asunder. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>27:19</b>   And now the astonishment of Alma was so great that he 
became dumb, that he could not open his mouth; yea, and he became weak, even that he could not move his hands; 
therefore he was taken by those that were with him, and carried helpless, even until he was laid before his father. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>27:20</b>   And they rehearsed unto his father all that had happened unto them; and his father rejoiced, for he 
knew that it was the power of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>27:21</b>   And he caused that a multitude should be gathered together that they might witness what the Lord 
had done for his son, and also for those that were with him. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>27:22</b>   And he caused that the priests should assemble themselves together; and they began to fast, and to 
pray to the Lord their God that he would open the mouth of Alma, that he might speak, and also that his limbs might 
receive their strength -- that the eyes of the people might be opened to see and know of the goodness and glory of 
God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>27:23</b>   And it came to passafter they had fasted and prayed for the space of two days 
and two nights, the limbs of Alma received their strength, and he stood up and began to speak unto them, bidding 
them to be of good comfort: <td bgcolor="eeeeee">


<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>27:24</b>   For, said he, I have repented of my sins, and have been redeemed of the Lord; behold I am born of the 
Spirit. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>27:25</b>   And the Lord said unto me: Marvel not that all mankind, yea, men and women, 
<span class="plag">all nations, kindreds, 
tongues and people</span>, must be born again; yea, born of God, changed from their carnal and fallen state, to a state of 
righteousness, being redeemed of God, becoming his sons and daughters; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>27:27</b>   I say unto you, unless this be the case, they must be cast off; and this I know, because I was like

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>27:28</b>   Nevertheless, after wading through much tribulations, repenting nigh unto death, the Lord in mercy 
hath seen fit to snatch me out of an everlasting burning, and I am born of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

the gall of  bitterness, and <i>in</i> the bond of iniquity -- <a href="../../acts/8.html#23">Acts 8:23</a>

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>27:30</b>   I rejected my Redeemer, and denied that which had been spoken of by our fathers; but now that they may 
foresee that he will come, and that he remembereth every creature of his creating, he will make himself manifest unto 
all. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>27:31</b>   Yea, <span class="plag">every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess</span> before 
him.  Yea, even at the last day, when all 
men shall stand to be judged of him, then shall they confess that he is God; then shall they confess, who live 
without God in the world, that the judgment of an everlasting punishment is just upon them; and they shall quake, 
and tremble, and shrink beneath the glance of his all-searching eye. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

That at the name of Jesus every knee should  bow.... And that every tongue should confess that Jesus
        Christ is Lord.  -- <a href="../../phil/2.html#10">Philippians 2:10-11</a>

<tr><td><b><a name="32"></a>27:32</b>   <span class="a">And now it came to pass</span> that Alma began from this time forward to teach the people, and those who were 
with Alma at the time the angel appeared unto them, traveling round about through all the land, publishing to all the 
people the things which they had heard and seen, and preaching the word of God in much tribulation, being greatly 
persecuted by those who were unbelievers, being smitten by many of them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="33"></a>27:33</b>   But notwithstanding all this, they did impart much consolation to the church, confirming their faith, 
and exhorting them with long-suffering and much travail to keep the commandments of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="34"></a>27:34</b>   And four of them were the sons of Mosiah; and their names were Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and Himni; 
these were the names of the sons of Mosiah. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="35"></a>27:35</b>   And they traveled throughout all the lands of Zarahemla, and among all the people who were under the 
reign of king Mosiah, zealously striving to repair all the injuries which they had done to the church, confessing all 
their sins, and publishing all the things which they had seen, and explaining the prophecies and the scriptures to all 
who desired to hear them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="36"></a>27:36</b>   And thus they were instruments in the hands of God in bringing many to the knowledge of the truth, 
yea, to the knowledge of their Redeemer. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="37"></a>27:37</b>   And how blessed are they!  For they did publish peace; they did publish good tidings of good; and 
they did declare unto the people that the Lord reigneth. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
