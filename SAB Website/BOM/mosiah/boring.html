<p><li>"And it came to pass that after Mosiah had done as his father had commanded him, and had made a proclamation throughout 
all the land, that the people gathered themselves together throughout all the land, that they might go up to the temple to hear 
the words which king Benjamin should speak unto them. ... O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God hath 
spoken it. " <a href="2.html#1">2:1-41</a>

<p><li>Mosiah tells us one more time about Jesus, who will be born in another 120 years or so. This is the umpteenth time Jesus is 
prophesied in great detail in the Book of Mormon. It's almost as though the whole thing was written using language that mimicked the 
King James Version of the Bible by someone living in nineteenth century America. <a href="3.html#1">3:1-27</a>

<p><li>"And king Benjamin again opened his mouth and began to speak unto them, saying...." <a href="4.html#4">4:4-30</a>

<p><li>And with that, King Benjamin broke into one of his boring speeches again. <a href="5.html#7">5:7-15</a>

<p><li>Lehi then preaches for a little while about how the tribute was their fault in the first place; that it was a punishment 
   sent from the Lord because of their iniquity. Luckily, God is now giving them a second chance. <a href="7.html#19">7:19-33</a>
