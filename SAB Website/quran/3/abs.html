 <p><li>Some scriptures are allegorical and some are not. No one understands the allegorical stuff except for Allah. 
 <a href="index.htm#7">3:7</a> 

 <p><li>Muslims are the best people. Most Non-muslims are "evil-livers." <a href="index.htm#110">3:110</a> 
 
 <p><li>Allah tells us about a battle between the good guys (the Muslims) and the bad guys (the non-Muslims). One side saw "clearly, 
 with their very eyes" that the other side had twice as many soldiers. End of story. "Lo! herein verily is a lesson for those who 
 have eyes." (I guess I don't have eyes.) <a href="index.htm#13">3:13</a> 
 
 <p><li>"If ye love Allah, follow me; Allah will  love you and forgive you your sins."</i><br>
	Follow Muhammad and Allah will love your and forgive your sins. Otherwise.... <a href="index.htm#31">3:31</a>

 
 <p><li>"Obey Allah and the messenger." But mostly the Messenger (Muhammad). <a href="index.htm#32">3:32</a>
 
 <p><li>Here's a fun story about Allah, Jesus, and magic clay birds.<br>
 "Lo! I [Allah] fashion for you [Jesus] out of clay the likeness of a bird, and I breathe into it and it is a bird, by Allah's leave. "
  <a href="index.htm#49">3:49</a> 
  
   <p><li>"Allah is the best of schemers." <a href="index.htm#54">3:54</a> 
   
   <p><li>"Why then argue ye concerning that whereof ye have no knowledge?"<br>
  Don't argue about things that you know nothing about. <a href="index.htm#66">3:66</a> 
  
  <p><li>Why does Allah like Muslims so much? Because they are the best people on earth, they behave themselves, forbid indecency, 
 and believe in Allah. Allah loves people who believe in him. (Most Non-muslims are "evil-livers.") <a href="index.htm#110">3:110</a> 
 
 <p>"Obey Allah and obey the messenger." <a href="index.htm#132">3:132</a>

<p><li>"Ye will overcome them if ye are (indeed) believers."<br>
	(Believers always defeat unbelievers.) <a href="index.htm#139">3:139</a> 
	
<p><li>Those who retreat while fighting in a holy war are inspired by Satan. <a href="index.htm#155">3:155</a>	

 <p><li>"Think not of those, who are slain in the way of Allah, as dead." <a href="index.htm#169">3:169-171</a>
