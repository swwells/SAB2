	<span class="a">exceedingly</span> fair.  And it came to pass that she did talk with her father, 
and said unto him: Whereby hath my father so much sorrow?  Hath he not read the record which our fathers brought across 
the great deep?  Behold, is there not an account concerning them of old, that they by their secret plans did obtain 
kingdoms and great glory? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>8:11</b>   And now Omer was a friend to Akish; wherefore, when Jared had sent for Akish, 
	<span class="a">the daughter of Jared 
danced before him that she pleased him, insomuch that he desired her to wife.  And it came to pass that he said unto 
Jared: Give her unto me to wife. </span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>8:13</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Akish gathered in unto the house of Jared all his kinsfolk, and said 
unto them: Will ye swear unto me that ye will be faithful unto me in the thing which I shall desire of you? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>8:14</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they all sware unto him, by the God of heaven, and also by the heavens, 
and also by the earth, and by their heads, that whoso should vary from the assistance which Akish desired should 
lose his head; and whoso should divulge whatsoever thing Akish made known unto them, the same should lose his life. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>8:15</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that thus they did agree with Akish.  And Akish did administer unto them

Avoid all those secret, abominable, murderous, wicked oaths and combinations passed down since the 
time of Cain. If you don't, God will have to kill you.
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>8:16</b> <span class="a">And they were kept up by the power of the devil to administer these oaths</span> unto the people, to 
keep them in darkness, to help such as sought power to gain power, and to murder, and to plunder, and to lie, 
and to commit all manner of wickedness and whoredoms. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>8:17</b>   And it was the daughter of Jared who put it into his heart to search up these things of old; and 
Jared put it into the heart of Akish; wherefore, Akish administered it unto his kindred and friends, leading them 
away by fair promises to do whatsoever thing he desired. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>8:18</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that 
	<span class="a">they formed a secret combination</span>, even as they of old; 
	<span class="a">which combination 
is most abominable and wicked above all, in the sight of God; </span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>8:19</b>   For<span class="a"> the Lord worketh not in secret combinations</span>, neither doth he will that man should shed blood, but 
in all things hath forbidden it, from the beginning of man. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>8:20</b>   And now I, Moroni, do not write the manner of their oaths and combinations, for it hath been made 
known unto me that they are had among all people, and they are had among the Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>8:21</b>   And they have caused the destruction of this people of whom I am now speaking, and also the destruction 
of the people of Nephi. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>8:22</b>   <span class="a">And whatsoever nation shall uphold such</span>
	<span class="a">secret combinations</span>, to get power and gain, until they 
shall spread over the nation, behold, they<span class="v"> shall be destroyed</span>; for the Lord will not suffer that the blood of his 
saints, which shall be shed by them, shall always cry unto him from the ground for vengeance upon them and yet he 
avenge them not. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>8:23</b>   Wherefore, O ye Gentiles, it is wisdom in God that these things should be shown unto you, that 
thereby ye may repent of your sins, and suffer not that these <span class="a">murderous combinations
	</span>shall get above you, which 
are built up to get power and gain -- and the work, yea, even the work of destruction come upon you, yea, even 
the sword of the justice of the Eternal God shall fall upon you, to your overthrow and destruction if ye shall 
suffer these things to be. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>8:24</b>   Wherefore, the Lord commandeth you, when ye shall see these things come among you that ye shall 
awake to a sense of your awful situation, because of this<span class="a"> secret combination</span> which shall be among you; or wo be 
unto it, because of the blood of them who have been slain; for they cry from the dust for vengeance upon it, and also 
upon those who built it up. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>8:25</b>   For <span class="a">it cometh to pass
	</span>that whoso buildeth it up seeketh to overthrow the freedom of all lands, 
nations, and countries; and it bringeth to pass the destruction of all people, for it is built up by the devil, 
who is the father of all lies; even that same liar who beguiled our first parents, yea, even that same liar who 
hath caused man to commit murder from the beginning; who hath hardened the hearts of men that they have murdered 
the prophets, and stoned them, and cast them out from the beginning. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>8:26</b>   Wherefore, I, Moroni, am commanded to write these things that evil may be done away, and that the 
time may come that Satan may have no power upon the hearts of the children of men, but that they may be persuaded 
to do good continually, that they may come unto the fountain of all righteousness and be saved. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
