<p><h4><a href="../1ne/1.html">1 Nephi</a></h4>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../1ne/abs.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p><li>"I, Nephi ... born of goodly parents ... highly favored of the Lord ... having ... a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God"<br>
The first book of the Book of Mormon is the First Book of Nephi. The author is a guy named Nephi who thinks quite a lot of himself. He had "goodly parents" was "highly favored of the Lord" and had "a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God." 

<p><li>"I make a record in the language of 
my father ... the language of the Egyptians." That's a strange language an Israelite around 
600 BCE to write in!  <a href="../1ne/1.html#2">1:2</a> 

<p><li>"I know that the record which I make is true."<br>
The book of 1 Nephi is true because Nephi says it is. And if you can't believe a pompous, 
Egyptian-speaking Hebrew that supposedly lived 2600 years ago, whom can you believe? <a href="../1ne/1.html#3">1:3</a>

<p><li>"There came a pillar of fire and dwelt upon a rock."<br>
Lehi prayed and pillar of fire appeared out of nowhere on a rock. <a href="../1ne/1.html#6">1:6</a>

<p><li>After Lehi saw the burning pillar on a rock, he "he thought he saw" God, lots of angels, Jesus, and the 12 apostles -- which is a 
strange sight for a Jew that lived 600 years before Jesus was born. <a href="../1ne/1.html#8">1:8-10</a>

<p><li>God, Jesus, the apostles, and the host of angels came down from heaven to earth and God gave Lehi a book to read. 
<a href="../1ne/1.html#11">1:11</a>

<p><li>"He read, saying: Wo, wo, unto Jerusalem, for I have seen thine abominations! ... Great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord 
God Almighty!"<br>
Lehi read from the book that God gave him while he quoted from Revelation -- which wasn't written for another 700 years or so. 
 <a href="../1ne/1.html#13">1:13-14</a>
 
 <p><li>"I make an abridgment of the record of my father, upon plates which I have made with mine own hands." <br>
 Nephi's (thankfully) going to just give us the abridged version of his father's babblings, which was probably a good idea since 
 he was writing this stuff down on brass plates.  <a href="../1ne/1.html#17">1:17</a>
 
<p><li>God speaks to Lehi in a dream and tells him to leave Jerusalem and go "into the wilderness." <a href="../1ne/2.html#1">2:1-2</a>

<p><li>So, with no further instructions, he and his family go into the wild. <a href="../1ne/2.html#4">2:4</a>

<p><li>Apparently the 400+ km hike from Jerusalem to the Red Sea took only three days. <a href="../1ne/2.html#5">2:5-6</a>

<p><li>Lehi named the valley after his other worthless son, Lemuel, hoping it would make him more steadfast and immovable. 
<a href="../1ne/2.html#10">2:10</a>

<p><li>"Nephi wanted to know the mysteries of God, so he cried unto the Lord. And the Lord softened his heart (and his brain) so 
he could believe the shit his dad said. <a href="../1ne/2.html#16">2:16</a>

<p><li>And the dumb-as-shit Sam went along with whatever Nephi said. <a href="../1ne/2.html#17">2:17</a>

<p><li>But Laman and Lemuel wouldn't listen to Nephi because they suffered from Pharaoh's syndrome: the hardening of the heart. 
<a href="../1ne/2.html#18">2:18</a>

<p><li>God told Nephi that he would lead him to a new land, a land that God had prepared just for him (and the Mormons) that was 
better than everywhere else on earth. (God made the New World just for Nephi and his family. For though it had been 
occupied by the Native Americans for 15,000 years or so, God made it for Nephi, not for them.)
<a href="../1ne/2.html#19">2:19-220</a>

<p><li>"I, Nephi, returned from speaking with the Lord." <a href="../1ne/3.html#1">3:1</a>

<p><li>God commands Lehi in a dream to send his sons back to Jerusalem (800+ km roundtrip) 
to get Lehi's genealogy that is written on brass plates.  <a href="../1ne/3.html#2">3:2-4</a>

<p><li>So the four brothers went back to Jerusalem. Now they just needed to decide how to get the brass plates back from Laban. 
Luckily, they had all read the Bible so they knew the proper way of deciding such things. They cast lots.  <a href="../1ne/3.html#10">3:10-11a</a>

<p><li>The lot fell upon Laman, so he went in to talk to Laban about the plates. But Laban refused to give him the plates, 
accused him of trying to rob him, and threatened to kill him.  <a href="../1ne/3.html#11">3:11b-13</a>

<p><li>After that, Laman, Lemuel, and Sam wanted to give up on the plates and return "to the wilderness."  <a href="../1ne/3.html#14">3:14</a>

<p><li>But Nephi talked them out of it in a long, boring speech.  <a href="../1ne/3.html#15">3:15-21</a>

<p><li>So Nephi and his brothers go get their father's gold, silver, and precious things (that were left behind on their wilderness trip), 
brought them to Laban, and offered to trade it all for the plates.  <a href="../1ne/3.html#22">3:22-24</a>

<p><li>Laban wanted their gold and whatnot but he also wanted to keep the plates. (He was into genealogy, too.) So he decided to kill 
them and take their stuff.  <a href="../1ne/3.html#25">3:25</a>

<p><li>Nephi and his brothers escaped to the wilderness and hid in "the cavity of a rock."  <a href="../1ne/3.html#26">3:26-27</a>

<p><li>Laman and Lemuel had had enough. They started to beat Nephi and Sam with a rod. <a href="../1ne/3.html#28">3:28</a>

<p><li>Then an angel showed up and told them to stop beating Nephi.  <a href="../1ne/3.html#29">3:29</a>

<p><li>But Laman and Lemuel weren't convinced by the angel.  <a href="../1ne/3.html#31">3:31</a>

<p><li> sine the angel didn't impress Laman and Lemeul, Nephi had to make another long, boring, BoM-type speech. 
<a href="../1ne/4.html#1">4:1-3</a>

<p><li>After the speech, Laman and Lemuel decided to follow Nephi back to Jerusalem, though they "did still continue to murmur." 
<a href="../1ne/4.html#4">4:4</a>

<p><li>When they got to Jerusalem, Nephi's brothers waited outside the gates while Nephi was led by the Lord to Laban's house. 
<a href="../1ne/4.html#6">4:6</a>

<p><li>The Lord lead Nephi to a drunk guy passed out on the ground -- who turned out to be Laban! <a href="../1ne/4.html#7">4:7-8</a>

<p><li>The Spirit of the Lord "constrained" Nephi to murder Laban as he lay passed out on the ground. <a href="../1ne/4.html#10">4:10</a>

<p><li>But the Spirit had to tell Nephi again. <a href="../1ne/4.html#11">4:11</a>

<p><li>And a third time, reminding Nephi that God kills people too (so it must be OK) and besides, it's better that one person die 
than a whole nation dwindle in unbelief. <a href="../1ne/4.html#12">4:12-13</a>

<p><li>So Nephi (finally) obeys the Spirit by grabbing Laban by the hair and chopping off his head with his own sword. 
<a href="../1ne/4.html#18">4:18</a>

<p><li>After Nephi smote off his head, he put on Laban's clothes (while the blood gushed from the carotid artery) and "gird on his armor 
about [his] loins." (Laban always wore armor on his loins when he went out partying.)<a href="../1ne/4.html#19">4:19</a>

<p><li> Dressed in Laban's blood-drenched clothes and loin armor, he went to the treasury of Laban and commanded (with the voice of Laban) 
Laban's servant to follow him. <a href="../1ne/4.html#20">4:20</a>

<p><li>And it worked perfectly. Nephi looked and sounded just like Laban, so it completely fooled Laban's servant. 
<a href="../1ne/4.html#21">4:21</a>

<p><li>Nephi chatted with Laban's servant for a while about all the usual things -- the wild party last night, gossip about 
the elders of the "church" (the Jews had churches back then), etc. Then Nephi told him to take the brass plates to his 
brothers who were waiting outside the city gates. <a href="../1ne/4.html#22">4:22-27</a>

<p><li>When Nephi's brothers saw Nephi and Laban's servant coming, they were "exceedingly frightened" since they thought 
Nephi was Laban, too! (It was an exceedingly good disguise.) <a href="../1ne/4.html#26">4:26</a>

<p><li>"When Laman saw me he was exceedingly frightened, and also Lemuel and Sam. And they fled from before my presence; 
for they supposed it was Laban."It must have been an exceedingly good costume! Even Nephi's brothers thought he was Laban 
(because he was wearing Laban's clothes).  <a href="../1ne/4.html#28">4:28</a>

<p><li>But then they heard his voice (he wasn't using the voice of Laban anymore) and they knew it was Nephi "wherefore they 
did cease to flee from [his] presence." <a href="../1ne/4.html#29">4:29</a>

<p><li>After brothers settled down, Nephi talked Laban's servant (Zoram) into joining up with them, and they packed up the brass 
plates and returned (400+ kilometers) to Lehi's tent. <a href="../1ne/4.html#38">4:38</a>

<p><li>Nephi and his brothers, along with Laban's servant Zoram, return to the wilderness from Jerusalem. 
The 400+ kilometer trip must have been routine by now, since Nephi says nothing at all about it. His parents, though, were filled with joy, 
exceedingly glad even, to see them.<a href="../1ne/5.html#1">5:1</a>

<p><li>After the boys got back, the parents just couldn't stop talking about it. After this manner of language did they speak. 
<a href="../1ne/5.html#3">5:3</a>, <a href="../1ne/5.html#6">6</a>, <a href="../1ne/5.html#8">8</a>

<p><li>After they were done speaking in that manner of language, Lehi took a look at the brass plates. They had all kinds of cool stuff 
written on them: the five books of Moses, the history of the Jews, and the prophecies of Jeremiah. <a href="../1ne/5.html#10">5:10-13</a>

<p><li>The plates had Lehi's genealogy, which showed that Lehi was a descendant of Joseph. 
(Joseph is a really important name in the Book of Mormon. I'm not sure why.) <a href="../1ne/5.html#14">5:14</a>

<p><li>When Lehi found out that he was a descendant of Joseph, he was filled up with the Spirit and started to 
prophesy about his seed, saying the plates would never perish or dim with time. (No one has seen them since.) <a href="../1ne/5.html#17">5:17-19</a>

<p><li>"And he prophesied many things concerning his seed." <a href="../1ne/5.html#19">5:19</a>

<p><li>Nephi is not going to say anything about the plates that he murdered Laban for, 
except that he and his family are descendants of Joseph. <a href="../1ne/6.html#1">6:1-2</a>

<p><li>Nephi is trying to use as few words as possible, since he is writing on metal plates. So it mattereth not to him that he give a 
full account of all the things, etc., etc. <a href="../1ne/6.html#3">6:3</a>

<p><li>So he's not going to write pleasing things; he's going to give commandment unto his seed. <a href="../1ne/6.html#5">6:5-6</a>

<p><li>God tells Lehi to send his sons back to Jerusalem to get some women. <a href="../1ne/7.html#1">7:1-2</a>

<p><li>So Lehi's sons went back to Jerusalem one more time. <a href="../1ne/7.html#3">7:3</a>

<p><li>It was just another quick, uneventful, 400+ km trip. After they arrived, the Lord softened up Ishmael's heart enough so that he 
agreed to leave Jerusalem with his family and go into the wilderness so that Lehi's sons could have sex with his daughters. 
<a href="../1ne/7.html#4">7:4-5</a>

<p><li>But then deja vu came to pass all over again. Laman and Lemuel revolted, along with two of Ishmael's daughters and two of his 
sons. <a href="../1ne/7.html#6">7:6</a>

<p><li>And then Nephi gave a speech that no one should ever have to read or listen to. <a href="../1ne/7.html#8">7:8-15</a>

<p><li>After listening to Nephi's awful speech, Nephi's brothers were exceedingly wroth. So they tied him up and left him for 
the animals to eat. <a href="../1ne/7.html#16">7:16</a>

<p><li>But then Nephi prayed unto the Lord. (His prayers are worse than his speeches.) And, just like magic, the cords were 
untied. <a href="../1ne/7.html#17">7:17-18</a>

<p><li>Nephi's brothers tried to lay hands on him again but he was saved by a daughter, mother, and brother of Ishmael, who 
softened the hearts of Nephi's younger brothers. <a href="../1ne/7.html#19">7:19</a>

<p><li>Then Nephi's brothers bowed down and begged Nephi to forgive them. <a href="../1ne/7.html#20">7:20</a>

<p><li>And it came to pass that Nephi forgave his brothers and they returned to their father's tent in the wilderness, where they 
killed and sacrificed some animals for God and began to get to know the daughters of Ishmael. <a href="../1ne/7.html#21">7:21-22</a>

<p><li>Lehii's Dream<br>
Lehi dreams about a tree with white, sweet-tasting fruit. He wants his family to eat the fruit. Nephi, Sam, and Sariah do; Laman and 
Lemuel don't. An iron rod leads people to the tree, but some are ashamed to eat its fruit after being taunted by well-dressed people 
in a building that floats in the sky. Those who don't eat the fruit or who leave after eating it are lost, drowned, or destroyed.<br>
(Lehi's dream was nearly identical to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life_vision">Joseph Smith, Sr.'s dream</a> 2400 
years later, before Joseph Smith, Jr. "translated" the Book of Mormon.) <a href="../1ne/8.html#2">8:2-38</a>

<p><li>Lehi thinks his dream assures the salvation of Nephi, Sam, and "their seed" and the damnation of Laman and Lemuel. 
(Because the former ate the magic fruit and the latter didn't.) <a href="../1ne/8.html#2">8:3-4</a>

<p><li>Lehi dreamed about tree with fruit that could make you happy if you ate it (or smoked it?). <a href="../1ne/8.html#10">8:10</a>

<p><li>Lehi partook of the fruit thereof, and it was the sweetest thing he'd ever tasted, and was whiter than anything he'd 
ever seen before. (Being white is the best thing a thing can be in the Book of Mormon.) <a href="../1ne/8.html#11">8:11</a>

<p><li> And it made him exceedingly happy, happier than he'd ever been before. He was so darned happy he could hardly stand it. 
So he wanted his family to eat from the happy tree, too. <a href="../1ne/8.html#12">8:12</a>

<p><li>So Lehi cast his eyes round about until he discovered his family. <a href="../1ne/8.html#13">8:13</a>

<p><li>Lehi told his family to eat the happy fruit, and the good members of his family (Nephi, Sariah, and Sam) ate it. 
<a href="../1ne/8.html#14">8:14-16</a>

<p><li>After the good guys ate the good fruit, Lehi cast his eyes about again until he saw Laman and Lemuel. He told 
them to eat the fruit, but they wouldn't do it (because they were bad). <a href="../1ne/8.html#17">8:17-18</a>

<p><li>Lehi saw an iron rod along the side of the river that people clung to as they traveled towards the happy tree. 
<a href="../1ne/8.html#19">8:19</a>

<p><li>In the background there was a mist of darkness that lots of people got lost in. <a href="../1ne/8.html#23">8:23</a>

<p><li>But some managed to find the happy-fruit tree by hanging on to the rod of iron. <a href="../1ne/8.html#24">8:24</a>

<p><li>But after partaking of the happy fruit, the people cast their eyes about like they were ashamed or something.
 <a href="../1ne/8.html#25">8:25</a>

<p><li>Then Lehi cast his eyes about again and saw a big building floating in the air. <a href="../1ne/8.html#26">8:26</a>

<p><li>The building was filled with people that were looking down and pointing and laughing at the people eating the happy fruit.
 <a href="../1ne/8.html#27">8:27</a>

<p><li>Then the people who were ashamed after eating the happy fruit crawled off into the darkness and got lost.
 <a href="../1ne/8.html#28">8:28</a>

<p><li>Some of the ashamed fruit-eaters made it to the big sky building, but others drowned. <a href="../1ne/8.html#31">8:31-32</a>

<p><li>Those that made it into the big building in the sky began pointing the finger of scorn at the happy fruit eaters below.
 <a href="../1ne/8.html#33">8:33</a>
 
 <p><li>Nephi left out a lot of shit his dad said in the valley of Lemuel. He just didn't have room for it on his plates. 
 <a href="../1ne/9.html#1">9:1</a>

<p><li>"The plates ... I have given the name of Nephi; wherefore, they are called 
the plates of Nephi, after mine own name; and these plates also are called the plates 
of Nephi." Okay, I guess we'll call them the plates of Nephi. <a href="../1ne/9.html#2">9:2</a>

<p><li>God told Nephi to make two sets of plates: one for "for the more part of the ministry" and the other set "
for the more part of the reign of the kings and the wars and contentions." <a href="../1ne/9.html#4">9:4</a>

<p><li>"The Lord hath commanded me to make these plates for a wise purpose in him, which purpose I know not." <a href="../1ne/9.html#5">9:5</a>

<p><li>"And thus is is, Amen." <a href="../1ne/9.html#6">9:6</a>

<p><li>"I, Nephi, proceed to give an account ... of my proceedings ... wherefore, to proceed with mine account, I must speak somewhat...." 
<a href="../1ne/10.html#1">10:1</a>

<p><li><a href="../../lk/7.html#28">Jesus said that John the Baptist was the greatest prophet</a>, but Lehi 
proves him wrong by prophesying the details of Jesus' life, death, 
and resurrection 600 years before he was born. Lehi even knew the Elizabethan English words that the King James 
Version would ascribe to John the Baptist 2200 years before that translation existed! <a href="../1ne/10.html#3">10:3-11</a>

<p><li>A spirit takes Nephi up to the top of an exceedingly high mountain and shows him all the shit his dad saw: Jesus, Mary, John the 
Baptist, the twelve apostles, Lehi's magic tree and iron rod, the large and spacious building, angels, devils, the condescension of God, 
and the wisdom of the world. <a href="../1ne/11.html#1">11:1-36</a>

<p><li>The first thing that comes to pass is that Nephi ponders his dad's imaginary tree, gets caught up in the spirit of the Lord, 
and is transported to an exceedingly high mountain. <a href="../1ne/11.html#1">11:1</a>

<p><li>And then he has a conversation with his new-found spirit friend. The spirit asked him what he wanted. <a href="../1ne/11.html#2">11:2</a>

<p><li>Nephi said he'd like to see some of the shit his dad saw. <a href="../1ne/11.html#3">11:3</a>

<p><li>The spirit asked Nephi if he believed that his dad saw the tree? <a href="../1ne/11.html#4">11:4</a>

<p><li> Nephi said that he believed all the crazy shit his dad said. <a href="../1ne/11.html#5">11:5</a>

<p><li>When the spirit heard Nephi's words, it started screaming. <a href="../1ne/11.html#6">11:6-7</a>

<p><li>The spirit shouted that because Nephi believes in his dad's cool tree, Jesus would come down from heaven to visit him. 
(Jesus believes in Lehi's tree, too.) <a href="../1ne/11.html#7">11:7</a>

<p><li>And then it came to pass that the spirit showed Nephi his dad's magic fruit tree. It was exceedingly white, too. It was 
like the whitest thing he'd ever seen.  <a href="../1ne/11.html#8">11:8</a>

<p><li>Nephi sees an exceedingly white virgin. (Being white is exceedingly good in the Book of Mormon.) But how the hell would 
Nephi know that the exceedingly white woman was a virgin? I guess Nephi could spot a virgin from 400 kilometers away. 
<a href="../1ne/11.html#13">11:13</a>

<p><li> After the spirit showed Nephi the exceedingly white tree and virgin, it blathered on a bit about "the condescension of God" 
and whatnot. Then it told Nephi that the white virgin "is the mother of the Son of God, after the manner of the flesh." 
(Does this mean that God the Father had sex with Mary "after the manner of the flesh?") <a href="../1ne/11.html#18">11:18</a>

<p><li>Then the spirit (or its angel sidekick) showed Nephi all the shit his dad saw and more. Jesus, Mary, John the Baptist, 
the twelve apostles, the crucifixion, a bunch of angels, Lehi's magic tree, fountain of living waters, iron rod, the large and 
spacious building, angels, devils, the condescension of God, the lamb of God, the Holy Ghost, devils, unclean spirits, the wisdom 
of the world -- the works. <a href="../1ne/11.html#19">11:19-35</a>

<p><li>In this chapter, the angel shows Nephi his seed. He'll have tons of seed, as many as the sand of the sea. <a href="../1ne/12.html#1">12:1</a>

<p><li>Nephi's seed will live in many cities, more cities than can be counted. <a href="../1ne/12.html#3">12:3</a>

<p><li>But bad times are coming. Mountains will disintegrate and cities sink and burn. <a href="../1ne/12.html#4">12:4</a>

<p><li>Then the heavens will open up and Jesus, the Holy Ghost, and the apostles (with their robes made white from being 
washed in Jesus' blood) will come down to minster to Nephi's seed. <a href="../1ne/12.html#6">12:6-10</a>

<p><li>But Nephi's seed will fight his brethren's seed. And it will be awful to look at. Seed fighting seed everywhere. 
I doubt if there has been so much contending seed in a single paragraph since time began. <a href="../1ne/12.html#19">12:19-20</a>

<p><li> Finally, the chapter comes to a thrilling conclusion with the angel showing Nephi what will happen to the seed of his 
brethren that dwindle in unbelief: they will become a dark, loathsome, filthy, idle, and abominable people. (Which, according to 
the BoM, is the origin of the Native Americans.) <a href="../1ne/12.html#22">12:22-23</a>

<p><li>Nephi sees the "great and abominable church" and its founder, the devil.
 <a href="../1ne/13.html#6">13:6</a>
 
 <p><li>The angel shows Nephi a Google Earth view of the Atlantic Ocean (the "many waters") that divides the old and new worlds. 
 <a href="../1ne/13.html#10">13:10</a>
 
 <p><li>The angel shows Nephi 
Christopher Columbus crossing the "many waters" in 1492 to visit the native Americans. <a href="../1ne/13.html#12">13:12</a>

<p><li>These "other Gentiles" were the Pilgrims arriving at Plymouth Rock in 1620. <a href="../1ne/13.html#13">13:13</a>

<p><li>The Nephites were "white and exceedingly fair." <a href="../1ne/13.html#15">13:15</a>

<p><li>"The Gentiles ... did humble themselves before the Lord; and the power of the Lord was with them." <a href="../1ne/13.html#16">13:16</a>

<p><li>The "mother Gentiles" are the English and the "battle" is the Revolutionary War. <a href="../1ne/13.html#17">13:17</a>

<p><li>God helped the American colonists win the Revolutionary War. <a href="../1ne/13.html#18">13:18</a>

<p><li>God helped the Americans win all their other wars too. (Except maybe the Vietnam war.) <a href="../1ne/13.html#19">13:19</a>

<p><li>The angel shows Nephi a book that "procedeth out of the mouth of a Jew" 
(the Bible, which was a lot like the brass plates). The good American white people that God liked so much carried this 
book around with them. <a href="../1ne/13.html#20">13:20-24</a>

<p><li>Good news for "gentiles" in "the promised land." ("Gentiles" are non-Mormons and "the promised land" is 
the United States in Mormon-speak). All you have to do is become a Mormon and then you will be blessed by God 
(otherwise you're going to hell). <a href="../1ne/14.html#1">14:1-2</a>

<p><li>The Catholic church was founded by the devil to lead souls to hell.  <a href="../1ne/14.html#3">14:3</a>

<p><li>f you're a gentile, you've only got two choices: become a Mormon or fall into the Catholic pit that leads to hell. 
<a href="../1ne/14.html#5">14:5-6</a>

<p><li>The angel tells Nephi that the lamb of God (Jesus) says that the time will come (2423 years later) when a 17 year old treasure 
digger from New York (Joseph Smith) will find some golden plates and translate them by staring into his hat at some magic rocks and 
thereby produce the "great and marvelous work" that we now know as the Book of Mormon. This book is, according to the angel, the best 
and most important book by far that you, me, or anyone else will ever read. And we'll be tortured forever after we die unless 
we believe it. <a href="../1ne/14.html#7">14:7</a>

<p><li>There are only two churches: the church of the Lamb of God, and the church of the devil. You either 
belong to the good church or the bad church (the mother of abominations, the whore of all the earth, 
whose founder is the devil). <a href="../1ne/14.html#10">14:10</a>

<p><li>The angel showed Nephi the Mormon church (the church of the Lamb of God). There weren't many Mormons, though, because of that 
fucking whore that sat on many waters (the Catholic Church). <a href="../1ne/14.html#12">14:12</a>

<p><li>God hated pretty much everyone on earth (they were all just a bunch of Catholics to him) until the Mormons showed up. 
<a href="../1ne/14.html#15">14:15-17</a>

<p><li>The angel told Nephi to look over there. You see that guy in the white robe? That's the apostle John who will write the Book of 
Revelation about 700 years from now. (Which doesn't make a lot of sense since the apostle John didn't write Revelation, but oh well.) 
<a href="../1ne/14.html#18">14:18-22, 27</a>

<p><li>The white-robed guy will write things that are just and true just like everything else that is written in 
 "the book that proceeded out of the mouth of the Jew." ("The book that prceeded out of the mouth of the Jew" 
 is BoM-speak for the Bible.) <a href="../1ne/14.html#23">14:23</a>
 
 <p><li>That's all Nephi is going to say about that. The angel won't let him say any more. So don't ask. But the angel showed Nephi lots of other 
 cool stuff that he can't tell you about right now. <a href="../1ne/14.html#28">14:28</a>

<p><li>Finally the angel stopped talking and Nephi quit writing down the things that he saw while he got all carried away. But it's all true.
 And thus it is. Amen. 10-4 good buddy. Over and out. <a href="../1ne/14.html#29">14:29</a>
 
 <p><li>Remember back in chapter 8 when Lehi had a dream about a tree? Yeah, well, it's back again. And this time it's causing trouble 
 for Nephi's brothers. You see, they just couldn't figure it all out. What was it, anyway? And who cares? A crazy old man dreams about 
 a tree and they're supposed to believe it has some cosmic significance, some deep spiritual meaning? Well, yes they are. This is the 
 Book of Mormon after all. <a href="../1ne/15.html#1">15:1-7</a>
 
 <p><li>Of course the main problem with Nephi's brothers was that they didn't inquire of the Lord enough. It's nearly impossible to believe complete and obvious 
 bullshit without God's help. <a href="../1ne/15.html#8">15:8-9</a>
 
  <p><li>Another reason they didn't believe the stuff about the tree is that they were such evil bastards. They didn't follow the commandments and their 
  hearts were way too hard. <a href="../1ne/15.html#10">15:10-11</a>

 <p><li>So Nephi explained it all to them again. The grafting of the branches thing is all about Joseph Smith who will (2423 years later) 
 find and translate the golden plates and thereby produce the Book of Mormon that will bring "the fulness of the gospel" to the 
 Gentiles. (And if that isn't perfectly obvious to you, you are an evil bastard that hasn't inquired of the Lord.) 
 <a href="../1ne/15.html#13">15:13</a>

 <p><li>Nephi says that someday the Native Americans (who centuries later will become a dark, loathsome, filthy, idle, and 
 abominable people for dwindling in unbelief) will all become Mormons and be saved. (I suppose God will then make them fair , 
 white, and delightsome like good Mormons are today.) <a href="../1ne/15.html#14">15:14</a>

  <p><li>Nephi goes on to explain the tree, iron rod, and river to his hard-hearted evil brothers. <a href="../1ne/15.html#20">15:20</a>

<p><li>There's an "awful gulf" that separates the wicked from the saints. <a href="../1ne/15.html#28">15:28</a>

  <p><li>If your works are filthy, then you are filthy. And if you're filthy, you can't go to heaven because you'd make God's 
  kingdom filthy. <a href="../1ne/15.html#33">15:33</a>

  <p><li>But, you see, the kingdom of God isn't filthy, so God had to make a filthy place to put filthy people after they die.
   <a href="../1ne/15.html#34">15:34</a>
  
   <p><li>And thus it is and so on and so forth. Amen. <a href="../1ne/15.html#36">15:36</a>
   
   <p><li>Nephi, his brothers, and Zoram (Laban's servant) all got married to Ishmael's nameless daughters. It was a group wedding 
   with Lehi serving as the Reverend Moon, saying stuff like, "Do you [Nephi, Laman, Lemuel, Sam, Zoram] take what's her name here 
   to be your lawfully wedded wife?" <a href="../1ne/16.html#7">16:7</a>
   
   <p><li>After getting that all taken care of, God showed Lehi something really interesting. A magic brass ball of curious 
   workmanship that was designed and made by God himself! God's magic ball had two spindles on it, one pointing the way to go 
   and the other pointing in some other direction. <a href="../1ne/16.html#10">16:10</a>

   <p><li>So now that they had their magic ball, they packed up camp, gathered seeds of every kind, crossed the River Laman, and 
   took off in whatever direction God's brass ball pointed. After traveling for four days in a SSE direction, they set up camp at 
   a place they called Shazer. (Notice how Joseph Smith Nephi gives names to pretty much every place they pass by, but didn't 
   bother to tell us the name of his wife.) <a href="../1ne/16.html#11">16:11-13</a>
   
   <p><li>They followed God's magic ball around for "the space of many days" in "the more fertile parts of the wilderness," 
   killing stuff for food with their bows and arrows and slings. <a href="../1ne/16.html#15">16:15-16</a>

   <p><li>And then it came to pass that Nephi broke his steel bow. Of course steel didn't exist at the time, wouldn't work 
   well for a bow anyway, and would be hard to break. But, oh well. This is the Book of Mormon. <a href="../1ne/16.html#18">16:18</a>
   
   <p><li>Apparently none of the other bows worked either, because after Nephi broke his no one else could kill a 
   thing. <a href="../1ne/16.html#19">16:19</a>

   <p><li>So everyone "began to murmur exceedingly." Heck even Nephi's dad, Lehi, "began to murmur against the Lord."
    <a href="../1ne/16.html#20">16:20</a>
   
   <p><li>So Nephi made another bow and arrow out of wood and a straight stick. But Nephi didn't know where to hunt 
   with his new bow. So he asked his dad (when he had stopped murmuring). <a href="../1ne/16.html#23">16:23</a>

   <p><li>Lehi inquired of the Lord (Hey God. Where should Nephi go to kill some animals?) Then voice of the Lord 
   came to Lehi telling him to look on the magic ball where he'd find a text message from God. <a href="../1ne/16.html#25">16:25-26</a>
   
   <p><li>And it came to pass that when they saw the text message from God they did fear and tremble exceedingly. <a href="../1ne/16.html#27">16:27</a>

   <p><li>Now the magic brass ball didn't work like a magic 8 ball. Magic 8 balls work all of the time for everyone, whereas the brass ball 
   only works if you believe it will work. And, of course, Nephi believed anything and everything, the crazier the better. So the pointers 
   pointed in just the right directions if you believed that they pointed in just the right directions. (That's the way dousing works too.)
   <a href="../1ne/16.html#28">16:28</a>
   
   <p><li>But the coolest thing of all was the text messages. They "changed from time to time" according to the faith of the person 
   reading the message. <a href="../1ne/16.html#29">16:29</a>

   <p><li>The message on the brass ball told Nephi to go to the top of the mountain. <a href="../1ne/16.html#30">16:30</a>
   
   <p><li>So Nephi went to the mountain top to kill wild beasts. <a href="../1ne/16.html#31">16:31</a>

   <p><li>After eating the wild beasts, they traveled for the space of many days. <a href="../1ne/16.html#33">16:33</a>
   
   <p><li>Then Ishmael dies, his daughters mourn exceedingly, and Nephi's brothers and Ishmael's sons decide to kill Nephi and 
   Lehi. <a href="../1ne/16.html#34">16:34-37</a>

   <p><li>But then the voice of God stopped by to talk for a while. He gave them some food so they decided not to kill Nephi and 
   Lehi. <a href="../1ne/16.html#39">16:39</a>

<p><li>A round brass ball "of curious workmanship" leads Lehi through the wilderness. A 
compass, perhaps? But <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass#History_of_the_navigational_compass">compasses 
didn't exist in 600 BCE</a> <a href="../1ne/16.html#10">16:10</a>, 
<a href="../1ne/16.html#16">16</a>

<p><li>Nephi breaks his bow, "which was made of fine steel." But the technology for making 
steel did not exist in 600 BCE. <a href="../1ne/16.html#18">16:18</a>

<p><li>God told Lehi to look at the brass ball and read the words written upon it. And when 
he read the words "he did fear and tremble exceedingly." <a href="../1ne/16.html#26">16:26</a>

<p><li>The pointers on the ball work according to the faith of its user.
 <a href="../1ne/16.html#28">16:28</a>

<p><li>And the words written on the ball change according to the faith of its user.
 <a href="../1ne/16.html#29">16:29</a>

<p><li>So Nephi found his way to the top of the mountain by following the instructions 
that were written on the ball. <a href="../1ne/16.html#30">16:30</a>

<p><li>In the last chapter, God gave Nephi a magic ball that pointed in the direction that God wanted him to go and even told 
Nephi where to kill wild beasts. All this happened within in single year: 600 BCE. Now it was time for some serious traveling. 
<a href="../1ne/17.html#1">17:1a</a>

<p><li>They waded through much affliction and their nameless women bore children in the wilderness. <a href="../1ne/17.html#1">17:1b</a>

<p><li>God fed them raw meat, their women gave plenty of suck, and the children grew up quickly, becoming as strong as men during 
the eight year journey. <a href="../1ne/17.html#2">17:2-4</a>

<p><li>After eight years of wading through affliction, eating raw meat, and getting plenty of suck, they arrived at a land they 
called Bountiful (because of its much fruit and also wild honey). And they saw the sea which they called Irreantum, which, being 
interpreted, means nothing at all. <a href="../1ne/17.html#5">17:5</a>

<p><li>Then it came to pass after a space of many days that he, Nephi, heard the voice of the Lord, saying, "Arise, get thee into 
the mountain." So Nephi got into the mountain and cried unto the Lord. <a href="../1ne/17.html#7">17:7</a>

<p><li>While Nephi was crying on the mountain top, God told him to build a ship. <a href="../1ne/17.html#8">17:8</a>

<p><li>Nephi asked God where he would find the ore to make the metal to make the tools to make the ship. <a href="../1ne/17.html#9">17:9</a>

<p><li>But it was no big deal. God showed Nephi where to find the ore to make the tools. <a href="../1ne/17.html#10">17:10</a>

<p><li>Nephi made a bellows from the skin of beasts so he could blow on a fire, which he made by striking two stones together. 
<a href="../1ne/17.html#11">17:11</a>

<p><li>Up to this time, you see, Nephi et al had no fire as they journeyed through the wilderness. They ate raw meat, which God 
sweetened for them. <a href="../1ne/17.html#12">17:12</a>

<p><li>So Nephi was pretty much all set. God showed Nephi where to mine the ore, from which he made ship-building tools using 
his trusty beast-skin bellows and striking stones. <a href="../1ne/17.html#16">17:16</a>

<p><li>But when Nephi's brothers saw what he was doing they began to murmur against him. <a href="../1ne/17.html#17">17:17</a>

<p><li>Whereupon Nephi began a long, boring 1000-word sermon. <a href="../1ne/17.html#19">17:19-47</a>

<p><li>Among many other things, Nephi told his brothers that God 
straitens murmurers by sending fiery flying serpents to bite and kill them. (See <a href="../../num/21.html#6">Numbers 21:6</a>) 
<a href="../1ne/17.html#41">17:41</a>

<p><li>Then Nephi reminded them about stuff they'd already seen on the trip: talking angels from time to time that sometimes 
whispered and sometimes screamed so loudly that the earth shook. <a href="../1ne/17.html#45">17:45</a>

<p><li>But Nephi's brothers were tired of Nephi and his screaming angels. So they tried to throw him into the sea. It didn't 
work, though, because Nephi he was filled with the power of God even to the consuming of his flesh and whoever touched him would 
wither like a dried reed. <a href="../1ne/17.html#48">17:48</a>

<p><li>Nephi kept talking on and on about many things to his brothers. Finally Nephi's brothers gave up and durst not touch 
Nephi with their fingers for the space of many days. <a href="../1ne/17.html#52">17:52</a>

<p><li>Still, God wasn't completely satisfied. He decided not to wither Nephi's brothers like dried reeds, but to shock 
the hell out of them instead. Just to show off a bit. <a href="../1ne/17.html#53">17:53</a>

<p><li>And it came to pass that Nephi stretched forth his hand to his brethren and they didn't wither, but the Lord did shake them, 
just like he said that he would. <a href="../1ne/17.html#54">17:54</a>

<p><li>And that did the trick. After God shocked Nephi's brothers they knew of a surety that God was with Nephi. They even wanted to 
worship Nephi, but Nephi told them not to, saying, "Oh My Heck, you guys, I'm just your younger brother." <a href="../1ne/17.html#55">17:55</a>

<p><li>Lehi and company didn't have to cook their food because God made it taste 
good raw. <a href="../1ne/17.html#12">17:12</a>

<p><li>God "sent fiery flying serpents" to bite people. <a href="../1ne/17.html#41">17:41</a>

<p><li> God shows Nephi how to work timbers of curious workmanship.  <a href="../1ne/18.html#1">18:1</a>

<p><li>Nephi explains (several times in the same verse) that he didn't work the timbers after the 
manner of men, but in the manner that God showed him.  <a href="../1ne/18.html#2">18:2</a>

<p><li>The ship took less than two verses to build, but by all accounts it turned out exceedingly fine. <a href="../1ne/18.html#4">18:4</a>

<p><li>When it was finished, they gathered up their stuff and boarded their unnamed ship, every one according to his age. 
 <a href="../1ne/18.html#5">18:5-6</a>

<p><li>After they all got on board, they sailed off toward the promised land (America in BoM-speak). <a href="../1ne/18.html#8">18:8</a>

<p><li>And then, after the space of many days, there was mutiny on the nameless ship. (Nephi didn't keep much of a log. Everything 
happens "after a space of many days.") Nephi's brothers, Ishmael's sons, and all their wives began to merrily dance, sing, and speak 
with exceeding rudeness. <a href="../1ne/18.html#9">18:9</a>

<p><li>So he, Nephi, began to fear exceedingly that God would smite them for dancing, singing, and carrying on like that. So he 
spoke to them with much soberness. But they all said unto him in unison, "Fuck off, little brother." <a href="../1ne/18.html#10">18:10</a>

<p><li>Finally, Laman and Lemuel got so sick of Nephi's pompous ass that they tied him up again (See <a href="../1ne/7.html#16">1 Nephi 7:16</a>). 
<a href="../1ne/18.html#11">18:11</a>

<p><li>hen the magic compass stopped working. <a href="../1ne/18.html#12">18:12</a>

<p><li>So they didn't know which way to steer. And then a great and terrible tempest came up for the space of three days. 
Everyone was exceedingly frightened. Still, they didn't untie Nephi. <a href="../1ne/18.html#13">18:13</a>

<p><li>The tempest became exceedingly sore on the fourth day. <a href="../1ne/18.html#14">18:14</a>

<p><li>And just when they were about to be swallowed up in the depths of the sea, they untied Nephi, 
whose wrists and ankles had swollen exceedingly and great was the soreness thereof. <a href="../1ne/18.html#15">18:15</a>

<p><li>Still, Nephi didn't murmur against the Lord but praised him all day long. <a href="../1ne/18.html#16">18:16</a>

<p><li>Nephi's dad said many things to the mutineers, but they ignored him. The rude behavior of their children 
sickened Lehi and his wife Sariah. (They were "stricken in years" and about to die even though they just had a 
couple of baby boys a few verses ago. See <a href="../1ne/18.html#7">1 Nephi 18:7</a>) <a href="../1ne/18.html#17">18:17-18</a>

<p><li>Poor little Jacob and Joseph were in need of much nourishment (Was Sariah still breastfeeding them?) and 
Nephi's nameless wife cried and prayed, along with Nephi's nameless children. <a href="../1ne/18.html#19">18:19</a>

<p><li>Finally they untied Nephi. The magic compass magically started working again and there was a great calm. 
<a href="../1ne/18.html#21">18:21</a>

<p><li>I guess the calm didn't last forever, though, because the ship began to sail again toward the promised land. 
<a href="../1ne/18.html#22">18:22</a>

<p><li>And after the space of many days, they arrived in the promised land. (And they did call it the promised land.) <a href="../1ne/18.html#23">18:23</a>

<p><li>After arriving, they began to plant the seeds that they brought with them. <a href="../1ne/18.html#24">18:24</a>

<p><li>Nephi found cows, horses, oxen, and asses when he arrived in the New World in 590 BCE. (None of these domesticated animals 
existed in North America before the Europeans brought them over 2000 years later.) <a href="../1ne/18.html#25">18:25a</a>

<p><li>And they found lots of gold, silver, and copper. <a href="../1ne/18.html#25">18:25b</a>

<p><li>God tells Nephi to make another set of brass plates. (This is his third set, I think -- not counting Lehi's.) I guess you just can't have too many plates. 
<a href="../1ne/19.html#1">19:1</a>

<p><li>On his third set of plates, Nephi only included the "more plain and 
precious parts," leaving out any unnecessary words, as you'd expect from someone engraving on plates of ore. <a href="../1ne/19.html#2">19:2-5</a>

<p><li>Nephi didn't write anything on the plates unless it was sacred. <a href="../1ne/19.html#6">19:6a</a>

<p><li>Nephi says that whatever he wrote on the plates was sacred. But he admits that he 
might make some mistakes, just like they (the guys who wrote the bible) did. Not that 
he's making any excuses, of course. <a href="../1ne/19.html#6">19:6b</a>

<p><li>Jesus will be born 600 years after Lehi and his family left Jerusalem (and 592 years after Nephi wrote the prophecy 
down in his little brass book.) <a href="../1ne/19.html#8">19:8</a>

<p><li>Since these prophesies about Christ are not found in Old Testament, Joseph 
Smith makes a few prophets up: Zeonock, Neum, and Zenos. These three prophets knew all about Jesus. He'd be crucified, 
buried in a sepulchre, and after his death, there'd be three days of darkness. Three days of darkness? Yeah, that's what Zenos prophesied. The entire earth would be completely dark for three days after Jesus' 
death (See <a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/BOM/3ne/8.html#20">3 Nephi 8:20-22</a> and 
<a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/BOM/hel/14.html#27">Helaman 14:27</a> for the exciting details), as a sign to 
Lehi's descendants in "the isles of the sea" (the Lamanites in America and Polynesia). Of course that's not what the Bible says. <a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/mt/27.html#45" 
title="SAB: Matthew 27:45">Matthew</a>, <a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/mk/15.html#33" 
title="SAB: Mark 15:33">Mark</a>, and <a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/lk/23.html#44" 
title="SAB: Luke 23:44">Luke</a> say it was dark for three hours just before Jesus died. (It's one of the few things those three 
guys agree on.) But that's because <a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/BOM/1ne/13.html#26" title="1 Nephi 13:26">the 
evil Catholics changed the plain and precious parts of the Bible</a>. <a href="../1ne/19.html#10">19:10</a>

<p><li>Zenos prophesied further that mountains would be carried away 
after Jesus died, along with lots of other nutty stuff. (See <a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/BOM/3ne/8.html">3 Nephi 8</a> where 
cities sunk, mountains were moved and dumped upon cities, etc.) <a href="../1ne/19.html#11">19:11-12</a>

<p><li>And finally, Nephi says he's going to swipe a couple of chapters from 
the book of Isaiah as a bit of filler for his plates of brass. <a href="../1ne/19.html#22">19:22-23</a>

<p><strike>Joseph Smith</strike> Nephi loved the phrase "and it came to pass." So why did he remove it 
from Isaiah 48:3? <a href="../1ne/20.html#3">20:3</a>

<p><li>And kings shall be thy nursing fathers. <a href="../1ne/21.html#23">21:23</a>

<p><li>How could Nephi, supposedly writing this around 590 BCE, quote words from the book of Malachi, which 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malachi">was not yet written</a>? <a href="../1ne/22.html#15">22:15</a>
        
<p><li>Notice that this verse (which was supposed to have been written around 600 BCE) quotes Peter's paraphrase of 
<a href="../../dt/18.html#15">Deuteronomy 18:15, 18-19</a>, rather than the Old Testament verses themselves. 
<a href="../1ne/22.html#20">22:20</a>

<p><li>Chapters 1-2: Second Nephi begins with Lehi rehearsing and rehashing the same old stories from Nephi's first book. 
Chapters <a href="../2ne/1.html">1</a>-<a href="../2ne/2.html">2</a>

<p><li>Joseph Smith got a little carried away with the fruit of various loins. In a single chapter (3) he mentions 
"fruit of my (his or thy) loins" 21 times. Verse 12 must set an all time record for fruits of loins: 5. 
<a href="../2ne/3.html#4">3:4</a>, <a href="../2ne/3.html#5">5</a>, <a href="../2ne/3.html#6">6</a>,

<a href="../2ne/3.html#21">21</a>

<p><li>Joseph Smith makes some modest prophecies about himself. He will be  a choice seer, esteemed highly, and
shall do "a work of great worth." He will be great in God's eyes, like Moses, and will do God's work. He will bring 
forth God's word, confound false doctrines, establish peace,  and bring knowledge in the latter days. All those who seek 
to destroy him will be confounded. He will be like God and will bring God's people to salvation. He will have exceeding faith, 
work mighty wonders, and do what is great in the sight of God. <a href="../2ne/3.html#6">3:6-24</a>

<p><li>Chapter 4 is a total waste of a golden plate. The 1350 or so words can be summed up with just two: Lehi died. <a href="../2ne/4.html#12">4:12</a>

<p><li>Chapter 5 begins with Nephi's brothers rebelling against him again. 
(See <a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/BOM/1ne/3.html#28" title="1 Nephi 3:28">here</a>, 
<a href="../1ne/7.html#16" title="1 Nephi 7:16">here</a>, 
<a href="../1ne/7.html#19" title="1 Nephi 7:19">here</a>, 
<a href="../1ne/16.html#34" title="1 Nephi 16:34">here</a>, 
<a href="../1ne/17.html#48" title="1 Nephi 17:48">here</a>, and 
<a href="../1ne/18.html#11" title="1 Nephi 18:11">here</a>  for previous rebellions.) Nephi cries to the Lord. After his 
brothers try to kill him, God tells Nephi to leave and take his brown-nosing family and fiends with him. <a href="../2ne/5.html#1">5:1-6</a>

<p><li>So they took all their stuff and camped out for a while at a place they called Nephi, where they decided to be called the people 
of Nephi (Nephites). <a href="../2ne/5.html#7">5:7-9</a>

<p><li>Nephi brought along the brass plates and the magic ball (or compass) that God made with his own hands. This was 
about 1600 years before <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass#History_of_the_navigational_compass">compasses 
</a> were used in navigation.</font> <a href="../2ne/5.html#12">5:12</a>

<p><li>Nephi teaches his followers to build buildings and work in iron, copper, brass, steel, gold, and silver. 
But evidence is lacking for such pre-Columbian metallurgy, and it would be well beyond the capabilities of a handful of 
immigrants from the ancient Near-East around 590 BCE. <a href="../2ne/5.html#15">5:15</a>

<p><li>The Nephites built a temple, like Solomon's but with not quite as many precious things. According to the 
bible (<a href="../../2chr/2.html#2">2 Chr.2:2</a>), it took 150,000 men seven years to build the temple, but Nephites crew 
of a dozen or so men managed just fine. <a href="../2ne/5.html#16">5:16</a>

<p><li>Then the people of Nephi who lived in a place called Nephi wanted to make Nephi their king. But Nephi said they should 
have no king. So Nephi became their ruler instead. <a href="../2ne/5.html#18">5:18-19</a>

<p><li> Everything was exceedingly good with the Nephites. Nephi made priests out of his little brothers, Jacob and Joseph. 
Everyone was perfectly happy. And Nephi wrote stuff down on his plates. <a href="../2ne/5.html#26">5:26-29</a>

<p><li>God told Nephi to write some other stuff down on some other plates. He told him to only write stuff that was pleasing 
to God. And that's what he did. <a href="../2ne/5.html#30">5:30-33</a>

<p><li>But Nephi only going to say this about that: 40 years passed and there were wars and whatnot. <a href="../2ne/5.html#34">5:34</a>

<p><li>Jacob (Nephi's newly-ordained little brother) gives a long, boring speech about  "exceedingly many things." <a href="../2ne/6.html#2">6:2-3</a>

<p><li>"And kings shall be thy nursing fathers." <a href="../2ne/6.html#7">6:7</a>

<p><li>God cut <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahab_%28demon%29">Rahab</a> (the sea 
monster) to pieces, wounded the dragon, and dried up the sea. <a href="../2ne/8.html#9">8:9-10</a>

<p><li>Jacob threw in a couple more chapters from Isaiah 
(see chapters <a href="../2ne/7.html">7</a> and <a href="../2ne/8.html">8</a>) so that 2400 years later the true (LDS) church would know the covenants that God had covenanted with the Jews 
(who will all have become Mormons by then). <a href="../2ne/9.html#1">9:1-2</a>

<p><li>After the Isaiah break, Jacob returned to his 19th century, frontier American, Protestant sermon, which he delivered to the Nephites circa 550 BCE, warning them that they will all burn in hell 
unless they repent and believe in someone (Jesus H. Christ) who will not exist for another six centuries or so. <a href="../2ne/9.html#3">9:3-54</a>

<p><li>Jacob takes off all his clothes and shakes them in front of his brethren, exposing himself in all of his glorious blood-free
 brightness to God's all-searching eye. <a href="../2ne/9.html#44">9:44</a>

<p><li>Jacob woke up the next day and started preaching again. 
He predicted that many Nephite children would "perish in the flesh because of unbelief." But not to worry, God will somehow 
restore the dead little unbelievers by forcing them to believe -- or something like that. <a href="../2ne/10.html#1">10:2</a>

<p><li>The kings of the Gentiles shall be nursing fathers. <a href="../2ne/10.html#9">10:9</a>

<p><li>God gave the entire Western Hemisphere to the Mormon Church, but he blesses non-Mormon, non-Catholic, white Christians ("Gentiles" in Mormon-speak) too. <a href="../2ne/10.html#10">10:10</a>

<p><li>God will protect and strengthen America (since it's his favorite country). <a href="../2ne/10.html#12">10:12</a>

<p><li>Non-Mormon Americans ("Gentiles") are the new Jews and will be both naughty and nice to Mormons, depending on how God feels at the moment. <a href="../2ne/10.html#18">10:18</a>

<p><li>America was consecrated by God to the seed of Nephi (Mormons). God likes America better than any other 
country. All Americans will someday worship God and become Mormons. <a href="../2ne/10.html#19">10:19</a>

<p><li>Jacob tells the Nephites that they are on an isle of the sea, and since the Bible mentions "isles of the sea" (see for example <a href="../../is/24.html#15">Isaiah 24:15</a>), 
there must be other isles that are inhabited by the descendants of other ancient seafaring Jews. (As I'm sure you've guessed by now, the other inhabitants of the "isles of the sea" are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamanite">
Polynesians</a>.) <a href="../2ne/10.html#20">10:20-21</a>

<p><li>"Jacob spake many more things to my people at that time; nevertheless only these things have I caused to be written, for the things which I have written sufficeth me." <br>
Yeah, Nephi, the things you have written suffieth me, too. I don't think I could take any more of Jacob's bullshit. <a href="../2ne/11.html#1">11:1</a>

<p><li>Nephi says he's going to include some more words of Isaiah, (He's already included about 5 chapters. See 
<a href="../1ne/17.html#39">1 Ne.17:39</a>, <a href="../1ne/20.html#1">20:1-22</a>, 
<a href="../1ne/21.html#1">21:1-21</a>; <a href="../2ne/6.html#5">2 Ne.6:5-7</a>,

<a href="../2ne/9.html#50">9:50-51</a>, <a href="../2ne/10.html#9">10:9</a>) because his "soul delighteth in his words." So he 
throws in another 13 chapters or so. <a href="../2ne/11.html#:2">11:2, 8</a>

<p><li> Nehi's soul delights in making things up about Jesus. <a href="../2ne/11.html#4">11:4-7</a>

<p><li>God will make sweet smelling things stink and people with hair, bald. <a href="../2ne/13.html#24">13:24</a>

<p><li>After God "washed away the filth" from the women and killed the men, he set up 
"a cloud and smoke by day" and a "flaming fire by night." <a href="../2ne/14.html#4">14:4-5</a>

<p><li>"The Lord shall hiss for the fly ... and for the bee." <a href="../2ne/17.html#18">17:18</a>

<p><li>"The Lord [will] shave with a razor ... the head and hair of the feet," where "hair" and "feet" are biblical 
euphemisms for pubic hair and male sexual organs, respectively. <a href="../2ne/17.html#20">17:20</a>

<p><li>Isaiah has sex with a prophetess who conceives and bears a son. (You weren't expecting a daughter, were you?) God then tells
Isaiah to call his name Mathershalalhashbaz. (It has a nice ring to it, doesn't it?) <a href="../2ne/18.html#3">18:3</a>

<p><li>God will "smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall slay the
wicked." God must have some pretty bad breath! <a href="../2ne/21.html#4">21:4</a>

<p><li>"The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb...." I wonder what will become of the spiders. 
Will they be more friendly toward flies? And will the parasitic wasps find another way to feed their larvae? Or will they 
continue to feed off the living bodies of caterpillars? <a href="../2ne/21.html#6">21:6</a>

<p><li>"And the weaned child shall put his hand in the cockatrice' den." A cockatrice is a serpent, hatched from a
cock's egg, that can kill with a glance. They are rare nowadays. <a href="../2ne/21.html#8">21:8</a>, 
<a href="../2ne/30.html#14">30:14</a>

<p><li>When God gets really angry, he causes earthquakes. <a href="../2ne/23.html#13">23:13</a>

<p><li>Dragons will live in Babylonian palaces and satyrs will dance there. <a href="../2ne/23.html#21">23:21-22</a>

<p><li>Notice that Joseph Smith threw in another "and it shall came to pass" into verse 4, even though it was missing from the 
verse (<a href="../../is/14.html#4">Isaiah 14:4</a>) he was copying from. I guess he just couldn't resist! 
<a href="../2ne/24.html#4">24:4</a>

<p><li>"Out of the serpent's root shall come forth a <i>cockatrice</i>, and his fruit shall be a <i>fiery flying 
serpent</i>." What ever happened to these fascinating biblical creatures? <a href="../2ne/24.html#29">24:29</a>

<p><li>Nephi's "soul delighteth in in the words of Isaiah." That's probably why he included 13 consecutive 
chapters from Isaiah. (2 Ne.12-24) <a href="../2ne/25.html#5">25:5</a>

<p><li>The Lord "will proceed to do a marvelous work and a wonder" (The Book of Mormon). <a href="../2ne/25.html#17">25:17</a>

<p><li>Joseph Smith (or Nephi) repeats the bible stories about the fiery serpents 
(<a href="../../num/21.html#6">Num. 21:6-9</a>) and the water-bearing 
rock (<a href="../../ex/17.html#6">Ex.17:6</a>, <a href="../../num/20.html#11">Num.20:11</a>). He figures that if you 
believe those stories, you'll believe his as well. <a href="../2ne/25.html#20">25:20</a>

<p><li>God will destroy (in various ways) those who "dwindle in unbelief." <a href="../2ne/26.html#15">26:15</a>

<p><li>God won't give good stuff to those who "dwindle in unbelief." <a href="../2ne/26.html#17">26:17</a>

<p><li>God will get the Gentiles to kill all those who "dwindle in unbelief." <a href="../2ne/26.html#19">26:19</a>

<p><li>The devil is the founder of all those "secret combinations." <a href="../2ne/26.html#22">26:22</a>

<p><li>People should work for Zion (the Mormon church) not for money. <a href="../2ne/26.html#31">26:31</a>

<p><li>The Book of Mormon prophesies itself! <a href="../2ne/26.html#6">27:6</a>

<p><li>The Book of Mormon will be sealed until God delivers it to a man.<br> (Gosh, could that man be Joseph 
Smith?) <a href="../2ne/27.html#7">27:7-9</a>

<p><li>"Wo be unto him that rejecteth the word of God!<br>(By "word of God" Joseph Smith means the 
Book of Mormon.) <a href="../2ne/27.html#14">27:14</a>

<p><li>The Book of Mormon is "a marvelous work and an wonder." <a href="../2ne/27.html#26">27:26</a>

<p><li>The Book of Mormon refers to itself as "a marvelous work" of God. <a href="../2ne/29.html#1">29:1</a>

<p><li>Another marvelous BoM prophecy: many shall say, "A Bible! We have got a Bible." And they certainly have. 
<br>This is especially amazing since this prophecy was allegedly made around 550 BCE, long before either the canon or the 
name of  the "Bible" existed. <a href="../2ne/29.html#3">29:3</a>

<p><li>Fools will say, "A Bible! We have got a Bible, and we need no more (damned) Bible." <a href="../2ne/29.html#6">29:6</a>

<p><li>Before many generations pass, Native Americans will convert to Mormonism, their skins will turn white, and they 
will become a "delightsome" people. <a href="../2ne/30.html#6">30:6</a>

<p><li>God will "smite the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath of his mouth he shall slay the wicked." 
How's <I>that</I> for some bad breath? <a href="../2ne/30.html#9">30:9</a>

<p><li>Those who reject the Book of Mormon are of the devil. <a href="../2ne/33.html#5">33:5</a>

<p><li>Those who believe in Christ will also believe in the Book of Mormon. <a href="../2ne/33.html#10">33:10</a>

<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../omni/abs.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p><li>The Book of Omni gets off to a great start for a book in the Book of Mormon with the words 
"Behold, it came to pass" but it goes downhill quickly from there. The purpose of Omni's little book is the same as the purpose of his 
father's book (the Book of Jarom) -- to preserve their genealogy. Exciting stuff. <a href="../omni/1.html#1">1</a>

<p><li> It turns out that Omni's little book wasn't written by Omni, at least most of it wasn't. Omni only wrote the first three verses, 
from which we learn the following things: Omni fought a lot with Lamanites, he was a wicked man, and he had a son named Amaron, 
who received the plates from Omni when he died. <a href="../omni/1.html#2">2-3</a>

<p><li>Amaron was a bit more prolific than his father, writing five verses. From them we learn that after 320 years the more wicked part 
of the Nephites were destroyed, but the Lord saved the righteous ones. Then Amaron passed the plates to his brother Chemish. 
<a href="../omni/1.html#4">4-8</a>

<p><li>Chemish wrote a few things in a single verse in the same book, from which we learn that his brother Amaron wrote what 
he wrote with his own hand (not somebody else's) and he wrote his five verses in a single day, after the manner that the
 Nephites kept there records, according to the commandments of their fathers. And with that, Chemish made an end. <a href="../omni/1.html#9">9</a>

<p><li>After Chemish made an end, his son Abinadom took over. Abinadom wrote two verses with three beholds, saying that he killed many Lamanites 
with his own sword. But he didn't know of any new revelations, "wherefore, that which is sufficient is written." <a href="../omni/1.html#10">10-11</a>

<p><li>After Abinadom's end, his son Amaleki took over. He spoke somewhat concerning Mosiah, the king of Zarahemla, which was a new land 
that the Nephites discovered while fleeing from the evil Lamanites. <a href="../omni/1.html#12">12-13</a>

<p><li>When the Nephites arrived in Zarahemla, they found the land already inhabited by the people of Zarahemla, who rejoiced exceedingly 
when they saw the Nephites because they had the plates of brass with the genealogies of the Jews. <a href="../omni/1.html#14">14</a>

<p><li> Now you might be wondering where these mysterious people of Zarahemla came from. It turns out that they were also 
long lost Israelites  That's right! They were seafaring Jews that, with God's help, sailed over "the great waters" from Israel 
after it was attacked by Babylon in 586 BCE. (The people of Zarahemla are called "Mulekites" later in the Book of Mormon. See 
<a href="../hel/6.html#10">Helaman 6:10</a>) <a href="../omni/1.html#15">15-16</a>

<p><li>After arriving in the New World, the people of Zarahemla (aka the Mulekites) became exceedingly numerous. But from time to 
time they had wars and whatnot. And because they didn't write stuff on brass plates, they became atheists and their language 
(Reformed Egyptian) became corrupted since. So the people of Zarahemla and the people of Mosiah couldn't understand one 
another. <a href="../omni/1.html#17">17</a>

<p><li> But these problems were easily solved. Mosiah taught the people of Zarahamla how to speak in Mosiah's 
language (Reformed Egyptian -- like all indigenous Americans speak), so they Mosiah could write down their 
genealogies too. (Although they didn't get to write them on the plates of Nephi.) <a href="../omni/1.html#18">18</a>

<p><li> After that, it came to pass that the people of Zarhemla and of Mosiah united together and made Mosiah their king. <a href="../omni/1.html#19">19</a>

<p><li> Then someone found this big rock with engravings on it. Mosiah, with the help of God, interpreted the engravings and found 
that they were written by a guy named Coriantumr, who lived with the people of Zarahemla for the space of nine moons. ("Nine moons" 
is "Indian talk" for nine months.) <a href="../omni/1.html#21">20-21</a>

<p><li>Okay, so where did this Coriantumr fellow come from? Well, Israel, of course, silly! All the indigenous people 
 in the Western Hemisphere came from Israel at one time or another. The Nephites sailed over in 600 BCE, the people of Zarahemla 
 (aka the Mulekites) did likewise in 586 BCE, as did Corantumr's people (aka the Jaredites) at the time of the Tower of Babel. 
 (You can read more all about the Jaredites in the <a href="../ether/1.html">Book of Ether</a>.) <a href="../omni/1.html#22">22</a>

<p><li>After Amaleki finished telling stories about the Mulekites and Jaredites, he began to be old and having no seed, he passed 
the plates to King Benjamin, who succeeded King Mosiah, and who drove the Lamanites out of the land of Zarahemla. <a href="../omni/1.html#23">23-25a</a>

<p><li> King Benjamin told everyone to believe in prophesying, revelations, speaking in tongues (which, according to the Bible, no 
one did until the day of Pentecost), and getting saved though Christ (who wouldn't be born for another couple couple centuries). 
<a href="../omni/1.html#25">25b-26</a>

<p><li>Before Amaleki makes an end of his speaking, he tells us about a certain number of Nephites who leave Zarahelma 
and to return to the land of Nephi. They were led by a stiffnecked guyt that got all of them killed, save fifty. After that, it 
came to pass that there was another attempted migration to the land of Nephi, with Amaleki's brother among them, and no one has 
heard from them since. <a href="../omni/1.html#27">27-30a</a>

<p><li> And with that bit of news, Amaleki makes an end of his speaking, and with the plates full, goes down in his grave. <a href="../omni/1.html#30">30b</a>

<p><li>"Words of Mormon" was engraved on golden plates by a Mormon prophet named Mormon <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/w-of-m/1?lang=eng">about 
	385 CE</a>. Mormon entrusted the golden plates to his son Moroni, who buried them on a hill in what would later become Wayne County, New 
	York. 1400 years later, after being resurrected as an angel, Moroni delivered the 
	golden plates to Joseph Smith. <a href="../words/1.html#1">1-2</a>

<p><li>Mormon finds and abridges the plates of Nephi, which were written over a period of about 1000 years. He wrote down 
less than one percent of all the stuff that was written, for which we should all be grateful. What he wrote he thinks is 
choice; he wrote it while the spirit of the Lord whispered to him. And he knows it will be preserved because it's such great 
stuff. <a href="../words/1.html#3">3-11</a>

<p><li> King Benjamin taught his sons Reformed Egyptian so they could read the brass plates. Good thing, too -- 
otherwise they'd suffer ignorance and dwindle in unbelief. <a href="../mosiah/1.html#1">1:1-5</a>

<p><li>Lehi, a 7th century Israelite, was taught in the language of the Egyptians. <a href="../mosiah/1.html#4">1:4</a>

<p><li>"And many more things did king Benjamin teach his sons, which are not written in this book."<br>
Thanks goodness for that! <a href="../mosiah/1.html#8">1:8</a>

<p><li>Before he died, King Benjamin selected his son Mosiah to replace him as king and gave him all his special things: the plates of Nephi,
the sword of Laban (that <a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2010/06/1-neph-4-better-for-one-man-to-die-than.html">Nephi used 
to decapitate Laban</a>), and <a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2010/10/1-nephi-16-group-marriage-magic-brass.html">the magic 
ball of curious workmanship</a> that was made by God himself. <a href="../mosiah/1.html#15">1:15-16</a>

<p><li>The Nephites multiplied exceedingly. There were so many, in fact, that they couldn't be 
numbered and a tower had to be erected so that everyone could hear King Benjamin's exceedingly boring speech. <a href="../mosiah/2.html#2">2:2</a>, 
<a href="../mosiah/2.html#7">7</a>

<p><li>"I say unto you that I have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together that I might rid my garments of your blood." King 
Benjamin assembled everyone in his kingdom to rid his garments of their blood. Good idea. <a href="../mosiah/2.html#28">2:28</a>

<p><li>Mosiah tells us one more time about Jesus, who will be born in another 120 years or so. This is the umpteenth time Jesus is 
prophesied in great detail in the Book of Mormon. It's almost as though the whole thing was written using language that mimicked the 
King James Version of the Bible by someone living in nineteenth century America. <a href="../mosiah/3.html#1">3:1-27</a>

<p><li> "The things which I shall tell you are made known unto me by an angel from God. And he said unto me: Awake; and I awoke, 
and behold he stood before me." <a href="../mosiah/3.html#2">3:2</a>

<p><li>Devils dwell in the hearts of the children of men. But Jesus will cast them out when he comes. <a href="../mosiah/3.html#6">3:6</a>

<p><li>When Jesus dies, 150 or so years later, blood will come from every pore. <a href="../mosiah/3.html#7">3:7</a>

<p><li>Jesus, who wouldn't be born for another 120 years or so, will be both the Son of God and the Father of heaven and earth. 
<a href="../mosiah/3.html#8">3:8</a>

<p><li> When King Benjamin quit speaking, everyone in Zarahemla fell on their faces and "they all cried aloud with one voice, saying: 
O have mercy, and apply the atoning blood of Christ that we may receive forgiveness of our sins, and our hearts may be purified; for we 
believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who created heaven and earth, and all things; who shall come down among the children of men." 
<a href="../mosiah/4.html#1">4:1-2</a>

<p><li>After King Benjamin's speech, he sent his officials out to ask the people if they believed the stuff he told them. He didn't 
need Nate Silver to do the analysis. Everyone believed everything he said and cried out together, "Yea, we believe all the words 
which thou hast spoken to us...." <a href="../mosiah/5.html#1">5:1-5</a>

<p><li>And, by golly, those were just the words King Benjamin hoped they'd say!
"These are the words which king Benjamin desired of them." <a href="../mosiah/5.html#6">5:6</a>

<p><li>After King Benjamin finally finished speaking (God, I hope he's really done this time), he decided to 
make a list of all the born-again Christians. It turned out that everyone had been saved, except for maybe the 
little children -- 120 years before Jesus was born! <a href="../mosiah/6.html#1">6:1-2</a>

<p><li>Benjamin made his son Mosiah king and appointed priests to instruct the people. Mosiah 
walked in the ways of the Lord and everything was peachy in Zarahemla, just like it was when his dad was king. <a href="../mosiah/6.html#3">6:3-7</a>

<p><li>The first three years of King Mosiah's reign were peaceful. But he was getting a little bored, and was wondering 
about his brethren who had left Zarahemla years ago. So he sent 16 of his finest men to the land of Lehi-Nephi to go 
looking for them. Ammon (a strong and mighty man) was their leader. <a href="../mosiah/7.html#1">7:1-3</a>

<p><li>After 40 days of wandering around, they set up camp on a hill north of Shilom, in the land of Nephi. <a href="../mosiah/7.html#4">7:4-5</a>

<p><li>The next morning, Ammon and three of his best men went down into the land of Nephi to explore. They 
promptly got thrown in jail by the king's guard. <a href="../mosiah/7.html#6">7:6-7</a>

<p><li> After two days in jail, the king brought them out for questioning. He told them that he was Limhi (the son of Noah, 
who was the son of Zeniff, who came up out of the land of Zarahemla) and then asked them to explain why they were there, or
 else be put to death. Seems fair. <a href="../mosiah/7.html#8">7:8-11</a>
 
 <p><li>Ammon bows and thanks King Limhi for not already killing him, and for letting him explain himself. There is so much to be thankful for! 
 <a href="../mosiah/7.html#12">7:12</a>
 
 <p><li>After Ammon tells his story, Lemhi is pleased. His people are being forced to pay a high tribute to the Lamenites, 
 and he figures that his long-lost brethren in Zarahemla will help him out of the mess. <a href="../mosiah/7.html#13">7:13-15</a>
 
 <p><li>So King Lemhi set Ammon and his men free, and allowed them to eat, drink and rest in the city. He even 
 sent a few guards to collect the rest of the men who were still camping on the hill. <a href="../mosiah/7.html#16">7:16</a>
 
 <p><li>Then King Lemhi sent a proclamation to all his people, telling them to gather together for a speech (oh boy!).
  Once everyone gathers around, he gives them the good news: "The time is at hand, or is not far distant, when we shall
   no longer be in subjection to our enemies." <a href="../mosiah/7.html#17">7:17-18</a>
   
   <p><li>Lehi then preaches for a little while about how the tribute was their fault in the first place; that it was a punishment 
   sent from the Lord because of their iniquity. Luckily, God is now giving them a second chance. <a href="../mosiah/7.html#19">7:19-33</a>

<p><li>A seer is greater than a prophet. He is a revelator with a Divine gift that is greater than all others.
 <a href="../mosiah/8.html#15">8:15</a>
 
 <p><li>"And a fifth part of their ziff"<br>
Oh no! Zeniff made the people give up a fifth of the ziff! Now <i>that</i> would be hard to live with. <a href="../mosiah/11.html#3">11:3</a>

<p><li>"King Noah built many elegant and spacious buildings" ornamented with gold, silver, iron, brass, copper, and ziff.<br>
Why is there no evidence for these fancy buildings? There were many of them, decorated with gold and silver. Where are they now? And 
the metallurgy technology for iron and brass didn't exist prior to European contact. But there was plenty of ziff around at the time 
so that wouldn't have been a problem. <a href="../mosiah/11.html#8">11:8</a>
 
 <p><li>God will smite his people with sore afflictions, famine, pestilence, and will cause them to howl all 
the day long. <a href="../mosiah/12.html#4">12:4</a>

<p><li>"Yea, even doth not Isaiah say:"<br>
Joseph Smith adds another chapter from Isaiah (<a href="../../is/53.html">53</a>) as filler. <a href="../mosiah/14.html#1">14:1</a>

<p><li>Jesus is <i>both</i> the Father and the Son! <a href="../mosiah/15.html#2">15:2-3</a>

<p><li>Nephi and Lehi had many daily revelations from God. <a href="../hel/11.html#23">11:23</a>
<p><li>"Behold, we are surrounded by demons." <a href="../hel/13.html#37">13:37</a>
<p><li>Another amazing prophecy: In five years the Son of God will come. And this was (according to my motel room 
version of the BoM) in the year 6 BCE! <a href="../hel/14.html#2">14:2</a>
<p><li>Wow! The night before Jesus was born there were great lights in the sky that made the night as bright 
as day!  <a href="../hel/14.html#3">41:3</a>
<p><li>"And behold this is not all, there shall be many signs and wonders in heaven." <a href="../hel/14.html#6">14:6</a>
<p><li>Jesus Christ is both the Son of God and his own Father! (Or something like that.) <a href="../hel/14.html#12">14:12</a>
<p><li>When Jesus dies (Remember this prophecy was made before Jesus had even been born!) it will be 
absolutely dark for three days and nights. No sun, moon, stars, candles, or campfires.
 <a href="../hel/14.html#20">14:20, 27</a>
<p><li>When Jesus dies mountains will become valleys and vice versa, cities destroyed, and dead 
people will come back to life. <a href="../hel/14.html#23">14:23-25</a>
<p><li>Dwindling in unbelief <a href="../hel/15.html#11">15:11, 15</a>
<p><li>The Spirit of the Lord was with Samuel, so the unbelievers' stones and arrows couldn't hit him.</font>
 <a href="../hel/16.html#2">16:2</a>
<p><li>"They began to reason ... that it is not reasonable" for Christ to be both the Father and the Son or that 
such a being would come to earth. And if he does exist, why doesn't he show himself to them?

<p><li>"The unbelievers" set aside a day just to kill believers. (They called it "National kill a believer day.")
 <a href="../3ne/1.html#9">1:9</a>
 
<p><li>God makes a repetitive and rambling speech announcing his own birth. He says that he'll be born tommorow. 
And that later that evening "a sign would be given." <a href="../3ne/1.html#12">1:12-13</a>

<p><li>And God's prophecy came true! That night "there was no darkness when night came ... but it was as light as thought it 
was mid-day." <a href="../3ne/1.html#15">1:15, 19</a>

<p><li>God removed his curse from the "good" Lamanites (the ones that "united with the Nephites"), and they "became 
exceedingly fair, with skins "white like unto the Nephites." <a href="../3ne/2.html#14">2:14-16</a>

<p><li>All of the Nephites believed everything they'd been told by "all of the holy prophets." <a href="../3ne/5.html#1">5:1</a>

<p><li>"And thus had the twenty and second year passed away, and the twenty and third year also, and 
the twenty and fourth, and the twenty and fifth; and thus had twenty and five years passed away."
 <a href="../3ne/5.html#7">5:7</a>
 
<p><li>In the name of Jesus, Nephi casts out devils and "unclean spirits". He even raises his brother from the dead. 
<a href="../3ne/7.html#19">7:19</a>

<p><li>When Jesus died, the inhabitants of many great cities died with him. Entire cities were 
sunk into the ocean, or were burned, or destroyed by earthquakes. <a href="../3ne/8.html#8">8:8-10, 14</a>

<p><li>When Jesus died, "the face of the whole earth became deformed." <a href="../3ne/8.html#17">8:17-18</a>

<p><li>For three days after Jesus died, there was absolutely no light -- not from the sun, moon, 
or stars, or from candles, campfires, or fireflies. <a href="../3ne/8.html#20">8:20-22</a>

<p><li>And it came to pass  that a voice (from the sky) was heard by every human on the planet! 
<a href="../3ne/9.html#1">9:1</a>

<p><li>The sky voice makes a long speech decrying the slaughter of his "fair sons and daughters." (That would be 
the Nephites. The dark skinned folks are the Lamanites.) <a href="../3ne/9.html#2">9:2</a>

<p><li>These words ("I am the Alpha and Omega") are taken from the book of Revelation, which was not written at the 
time (34 CE). And they wouldn't have meant anything anyway to the Nephites since "alpha" and "omega" would have been 
greek to them. <a href="../3ne/9.html#18">9:18</a>

<p><li>All of the people again heard a disembodied voice from the sky. <a href="../3ne/10.html#3">10:3</a>

<p><li>The bodyless, repetitive  voice said:<br> "How oft have I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings.... <br>
How oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings.... <br>
How oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens....<br>
How oft will I gather you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings...." <a href="../3ne/10.html#4">10:4-6</a>

<p><li>Damned if everyone doesn't hear a voice from the sky again --  for the third time! (See chapters 
<a href="../3ne/9.html#1">9</a> and <a href="../3ne/10.html#3">10</a> for the first two speeches by the sky guy.) But they 
couldn't understand it this time. <a href="../3ne/11.html#3">11:3</a>

<p><li>And they hear the voice again (for the fourth time), but again they couldn't understand it.
 <a href="../3ne/11.html#4">11:4</a>
 
<p><li>"And behold, the third time" (or the fifth?) they heard the voice. But this time they undersood!
 <a href="../3ne/11.html#5">11:5</a>
 
 <p><li>Then the crowd saw a man coming down from the sky! <a href="../3ne/11.html#8">11:8</a>
 
 <p><li>"And the Lord said unto him: I give unto you power that ye shall baptize this people."<br>
Jesus gives Nephi the power to baptize, which is kind of weird since Nephi had baptized pretty much everyone already (see 
<a href="../3ne/1.html#23">3 Nephi 1:23</a>, <a href="../3ne/7.html#24">7:24-26</a>, and <a href="../3ne/9.html#20">9:20</a>). 
<a href="../3ne/11.html#21">11:21</a>

 
<p><li>Jesus says that he wants everyone to agree on everything with ragard to religion. He says that whoever 
argues with anyone about anything is "of the devil." <a href="../3ne/11.html#28">11:28-29</a>

<p><li>Jesus' bowels are filled with compassion and mercy. <a href="../3ne/17.html#6">17:6-7</a>

<p><li>After they were blessed by Jesus, the disciples became whiter than anything else on earth. 
<a href="../3ne/19.html#25">19:25</a>

<p><li>The disciples were white -- as white as Jesus! <a href="../3ne/19.html#30">19:30</a>

<p><li>Some folks "dwindle in unbelief" because of their iniquity. <a href="../3ne/21.html#5">21:5</a>

<p><li>Note that "Sun" in <a href="../../mal/4.html#2">Malachi 4:2</a> is changed to "Son" in the BOM. 
<a href="../3ne/25.html#2">25:2</a>

<p><li>The elements will melt, the earth will be rolled up like a scroll, and heaven and earth will 
pass away. <a href="../3ne/26.html#3">26:3</a>

<p><li>Nothing can stop the followers of Jesus. Prisons can't hold them, fire can't burn them, and wild animals can't harm them.
 <a href="../3ne/28.html#19">28:19-22</a>

dwell in the hearts of the people."<br> (Everyone loved everyone else.) <a href="../4ne/1.html#15">15</a>

<p><li>Everyone was perfectly happy. No lies were told, no murders committed, not a single envious thought or discouraging word 
could be found among all the people.  <a href="../4ne/1.html#16">16-17</a>

<p><li>All was well until a few of the people revolted against the church and began to call themselves Lamanites. So there 
were Lamanites in the land again. <a href="../4ne/1.html#20">20</a>

<p><li>Mormon wrote a letter to the Lamanite king asking him to fight a war with the Nephites at hill Cumorah (near Manchester, New York).

<p><li>Mormon decides to write down a record on the plates of Nephi and bury them on hill Cumorah.

<p><li>Moroni translated the 24 plates that the people of Limri had found. And although he seems to remember some stuff about Adam, the 
tower of Babel, etc., he decided to leave that part out since you can read all about it in the Bible.

<a href="../ether/1.html#6">1:6-32</a>

<p><li>"Coriantor was the son of Moron."<br>
Yes, there really is a Moron in the Book of Mormon. <a href="../ether/1.html#7">1:7</a>
 
<p><li>The Jaredites were Israelites who lived at the time of the Tower of Babel. (<a href="../../gen/11.html#9">Genesis 11:1-9</a>)
<a href="../ether/1.html#33">1:33</a>

<p><li>The brother of Jared was a large, mighty (but apparently nameless) man who was "highly favored of the Lord." He cried to the 
Lord (two times) and the Lord spared the Jaredites from having their language confounded. <a href="../ether/1.html#34">1:34-37</a>

<p><li>"I will go before thee into a land which is choice above all the lands of the earth."<br>
 (God likes the New World a lot better than the Old.) <a href="../ether/1.html#42">1:42</a>
 
 <p><li>"There shall be none greater than the nation which I will raise up unto me of thy seed, upon all

<p><li>"The Lord did go before them, and did talk with them as he stood in a cloud, and gave directions whither they should travel." <a href="../ether/2.html#5">2:5</a>
       
<p><li>"A land ... choice above all other lands ... preserved for a righteous people"<br> 
God likes America best. He made it for a righteous people (the Mormons), and America will face God's wrath if it fails to please him 
(and them). <a href="../ether/2.html#7">2:7-10, 15</a>

<p><li>"The Lord came again unto the brother of Jared, and stood in a cloud and talked with him.  And for the space of three 
hours did the Lord talk with the brother of Jared." <a href="../ether/2.html#14">2:14</a>

<p><li>Under God's instructions, the Jaredites build small, light barges to travel to 
the New World. <a href="../ether/2.html#16">2:16</a>
 
<p><li>"They were exceedingly tight, even that they would hold water like unto a dish; and the 
bottom thereof was tight like unto a dish; and the sides thereof were tight like unto a dish 
 ... and the top thereof was tight like unto a dish; and the length thereof was the length of a tree; and the door thereof, 
when it was shut, was tight like unto a dish."<br> (It was as tall as a tree and as tight as a dish.) 
<a href="../ether/2.html#17">2:17</a>

<p><li>"And the Lord said unto the brother of Jared: Behold, thou shalt make a hole in the top, and also in the 
bottom; and when thou shalt suffer for air thou shalt unstop the hole and receive air.  And if it be so that the water 
come in upon thee, behold, ye shall stop the hole, that ye may not perish in the flood." <a href="../ether/2.html#20">2:20</a>

<p><li>"Ye shall be as a whale in the midst of the sea."
The Jaredites are plunged into "the depths of the sea", but they survive using a magic light that Jesus gives 
them. <a href="../ether/2.html#24">2:24-25</a>

<p><li>The brother of Jared made 16 small stones, as clear as glass, out of molten rock. He then 
asked God to touch the stones to make them into lights to light up the inside of the barges. God 
did as the brother of Jared requested. <a href="../ether/3.html#1">3:1-6</a>

<p><li>"The brother of Jared ... saw the finger of the Lord; and it was as the finger of a man." <a href="../ether/3.html#6">3:6</a>

<p><li>"I [Jared] saw the finger of the Lord, and I feared lest he should smite me; for I knew not that the Lord had 
flesh and blood." <a href="../ether/3.html#8">3:8</a>

<p><li>"Because of thy faith thou hast seen ... Sawest thou more than this?"</i><br>
God let Jared see his finger. But God isn't sure what 
else he might have seen, so he asked, &quot;You didn't see anything else, did you?&quot;

hast." <a href="../ether/3.html#15">3:15</a>

<p><li>"Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit."<br>
Shucks! The body of God that the brother of Jared saw was just God's spirit body, not his real body. 
 <a href="../ether/3.html#16">3:16</a>

<p><li>"He [the brother of Jared] saw the finger of Jesus ... and he had faith no longer, 
for he knew, nothing doubting." <a href="../ether/3.html#19">3:19</a>

<p><li>"Ye shall write them in a language that they cannot be read."</i><br>
God tells the brother of Jared to write his scriptures in a language that no one can read. (Good idea!) 
<a href="../ether/3.html#22">3:22</a>

<p><li>"These stones shall magnify to the eyes of men these things which ye shall write."<br>
God gives the brother of Jared two magic stones that will "magnify the eyes of men" so that they can read what Jared

(Didn't they take the last train to the coast?) <a href="../ether/5.html#3">5:3-4</a>

<p><li>More "secret combinations" <a href="../ether/9.html#1">9:1</a>

<p><li>"The Lord did pour out his blessings upon this land, which was choice above all other 
 lands." <a href="../ether/9.html#20">9:20</a>
 
 <p><li>"Coriantum took to wife, in his old age, a young maid, and begat sons and daughters; wherefore he lived until he was an hundred and forty 
 and two years old." <a href="../ether/9.html#24">9:24</a>
 
 <p><li>"There came forth poisonous serpents also upon the face of the land, and did poison many people." 
<a href="../ether/9.html#31">9:31</a>

<p><li>"Lib also did that which was good in the sight of the Lord. And ... the poisonous serpents were 
destroyed." <a href="../ether/10.html#19">10:19</a>

<p><li>"A land that was choice above all lands, for the Lord had spoken it." <a href="../ether/10.html#28">10:28</a>

<p><li>To punish the people for "their wicked combinations," God sent wars, famines, and pestilences. The resulting 
 destruction was the greatest ever seen on the face of the earth -- greater than the flood of Noah, the 
 destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, or World War II.  Yet there is no evidence 
	for any of this today. <a href="../ether/11.html#7">11:7</a>
	
<p><li>Moron did that which was wicked before the Lord." <a href="../ether/11.html#14">11:14</a>
	
<p><li>"They did reject all the words of the prophets, because of their secret society." 
<a href="../ether/11.html#22">11:22</a>

<p><li>"And now, I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning these things..."<br>
Don't you just love the way people talk in the Book of Mormon? <a href="../ether/12.html#6">12:6</a>

<p><li>"When God put forth his finger he could not hide it from the sight of the brother of Jared." 
<a href="../ether/12.html#20">12:20</a>

<p><li>"The Gentiles will mock at these things, because of our weakness in writing." 
<a href="../ether/12.html#23">12:23-25</a>

<p><li>The brother of Jared said unto the mountain Zerin, Remove -- and it was removed." <a href="../ether/12.html#30">12:30</a>

<p><li>"The brother of Shared ... received great strength to his army because of secret combinations." 
<a href="../ether/14.html#8">14:8</a>

<p><li>"One of the secret combinations murdered him in a secret pass."  <a href="../ether/14.html#10">14:10</a>

<p><li>"And the scent thereof went forth upon the face of the land, even upon all the face of the land; 
wherefore the people became troubled by day and by night, because of the scent thereof."</i><br>
(It stank!) <a href="../ether/14.html#23">14:23</a>

<p><li>"There had been slain two millions of mighty men, and also their wives and their children."
