<p>(5:1a) <i>"And it came to pass that after we had come down into the wilderness unto our father."</i>

<p>(5:1b) The 400+ kilometer trip must have been routine by now, because 
Nephi says nothing at all about it. His parents, though, were filled with joy, exceedingly glad even, to see them.

<p><i>"Behold, he was filled with joy, and also my mother, Sariah, was exceedingly glad, for she truly had mourned because of us."</i>

<p>(5:3-8) In fact, after the boys got back, the parents just couldn't stop 
talking about it. After this manner of language did they speak:

<p>(5:6) <i>"And after this manner of language did my father, Lehi, comfort my mother, Sariah."</i>

<img src="../../images/sci1.gif" > (5:10-13) After they were done speaking in that manner of language, 
Lehi took a look at the brass plates. They had all kinds of cool 
stuff written on them: the five books of Moses, the story of Adam and Eve (Mormons can't believe in Evolution), the history of the Jews, 
and the prophecies of Jeremiah.

<p><i>"Lehi ... beheld that they did contain the five books of Moses, which gave an account of the creation of the world, 
and also of Adam and Eve, who were our first parents; ... And also a record of the Jews from the beginning, 
even down to the commencement of the reign of Zedekiah ... And also 
the prophecies which have been spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (5:14) And, most important of all, the plates had Lehi's genealogy, 
which showed that Lehi was a descendant of Joseph. (Joseph is a really important name in the Book of Mormon. I'm not sure why.)

of his fathers; wherefore he knew that he was a descendant of Joseph."</i>
