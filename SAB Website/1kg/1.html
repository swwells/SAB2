  And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had
    made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he
    said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="42">1:42</A></B>
  And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest

    bringest good tidings.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David
    hath made Solomon king.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet,
    and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites,
    and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule:<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David,
    saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his
    throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="48">1:48</A></B>
  And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which hath
    given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and
    went every man his way.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught
    hold on the horns of the altar.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="51">1:51</A></B>
  And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon:
    for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king
    Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the
    sword.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="52">1:52</A></B>
  And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an

    shall die.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he
    came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to
