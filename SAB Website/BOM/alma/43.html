"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",
"<span class='i'>Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever.</span>--<a href='3.html#14'>Alma 3:14</a>",
"<span class='i'>I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</span>--<a href='3.html#15'>Alma 3:15</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",
"<span class='a'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges ... even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year....</span>--<a href='16.html#1'>Alma 16:1</a>",
"<span class='a'>Their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.</span>--<a href='16.html#11'>Alma 16:11</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.   Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</span>--<a href='30.html#22'>Alma 30:22</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",
"<span class='i'>God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.</span>--<a href='30.html#47'>Alma 30:47</a>",
"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",

"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",
"<span class='i'>These dissenters ... became ... more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='47.html#36'>Alma 47:36</a>",
"<span class='a'>God would prosper them in the land, or in other words ... God ... would prosper them in the land.</span>--<a href='48.html#15'>Alma 48:15</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='50.html#22'>Alma 50:22</a>",
"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",
"<span class='i'>The remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty.</span>--<a href='51.html#20'>Alma 51:20</a>",
"<span class='g'>And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye.</span>--<a href='54.html#21'>Alma 54:21</a>",

<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="1, 4"></a>43:1</b>   <span class="a">And now it came to pass</span> that the sons of Alma did go forth among the people, to declare the word unto 
them.  And Alma, also, himself, could not rest, and he also went forth. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1"><a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a><br>
(43:1, 4, 5, 15, 18, 22, 23, 24, 27, 34, 36, 39, 41, 48, 49)
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>43:2</b>   Now we shall say no more concerning their preaching, except that they preached the word, and the 
truth, according to the spirit of prophecy and revelation; and they preached after the holy order of God by which 
they were called. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>43:3</b>   And now I return to an account of the wars between the Nephites and the Lamanites, in the eighteenth 
year of the reign of the judges. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>43:4</b>   <span class="a">For behold, it came to pass</span> that the Zoramites became Lamanites; therefore, in the commencement of 
the eighteenth year the people of the Nephites saw that the Lamanites were coming upon them; therefore they made 
preparations for war; yea, they gathered together their armies in the land of Jershon. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>43:5</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Lamanites came with their thousands; and they 
came into the land of Antionum, which is the land of the Zoramites; and a man by the name of Zerahemnah was their 
leader. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>43:6</b>   And now, as <span class="i">the Amalekites were of a more wicked and murderous 
disposition than the Lamanites </span>
were, in and of themselves, therefore, Zerahemnah appointed chief captains over the Lamanites, and they were all 
Amalekites and Zoramites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/inj1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<img src="../../images/int.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1">The Amalekites were even "more wicked and murderous" than the Lamanites.
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>43:7</b>   Now this he did that he might preserve their hatred towards the Nephites, that he might bring 
them into subjection to the accomplishment of his designs. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>43:8</b>   For behold, his designs were to stir up the Lamanites to anger against the Nephites; this he 
did that he might usurp great power over them, and also that he might gain power over the Nephites by bringing 
them into bondage. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>43:9</b>   And now the design of the Nephites was to support their lands, and their houses, and their wives, 
and their children, that they might preserve them from the hands of their enemies; and also that they might 
preserve their rights and their privileges, yea, and also their liberty, that they might worship God according 
to their desires. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>43:10</b>   For they knew that if they should fall into the hands of the Lamanites, that 
whosoever should <span class="c">worship God in spirit and in truth</span>, the true and the living God, the Lamanites would destroy. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/plag.gif" border="0" width="32" height="32"><font size="-1">
... they that worship him must worship <i>him</i> in spirit and in truth. -- <a href="../../jn/4.html#24">Jn.4:24</a></font>

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>43:11</b>   Yea, and they also knew the extreme hatred of the Lamanites towards their brethren, who were 
the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, who were called the people of Ammon -- and they would not take up arms, yea, they 
had entered into a covenant and they would not break it -- therefore, if they should fall into the hands of the 
Lamanites they would be destroyed. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>43:12</b>   And the Nephites would not suffer that they should be destroyed; therefore they gave them 
lands for their inheritance. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>43:13</b>   And the people of Ammon did give unto the Nephites a large portion of their substance to 
support their armies; and thus the Nephites were compelled, alone, to withstand against the Lamanites, who 
were a compound of Laman and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, and all those 
who had dissented from the Nephites, who were Amalekites and Zoramites, and the descendants of the priests of 
Noah. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>43:14</b>   Now those descendants were as numerous, nearly, as were the Nephites; and thus the Nephites were 
obliged to contend with their brethren, even unto bloodshed. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>43:15</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> as the armies of the Lamanites had gathered together in 
the land of Antionum, behold, the armies of the Nephites were prepared to meet them in the land of Jershon. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>43:16</b>   Now, the leader of the Nephites, or the man who had been appointed to be the chief captain over 
the Nephites -- now the chief captain took the command of all the armies of the Nephites -- and his name was Moroni; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>43:17</b>   And Moroni took all the command, and the government of their wars.  And he was only twenty and 
five years old when he was appointed chief captain over the armies of the Nephites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>43:18</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that he met the Lamanites in the borders of 
Jershon, and <span class="sci">his people were armed with swords, and with cimeters, and all manner of weapons of war.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/sci1.gif" width="32" height="32"><br>
<font size="-1">More metal swords, cimeters, and breastplates, none of which has ever been found. (43:18-20)</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>43:19</b>   And when the armies of the Lamanites saw that the people of Nephi, or that Moroni, had 
prepared his people with <span class="sci">breastplates and with arm-shields, yea, and also shields</span> to defend their heads, and 
also they were dressed with thick clothing --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>43:20</b>   Now the army of Zerahemnah was not prepared with any such thing; they had only 
<span class="sci">their swords 
and their cimeters</span>, their bows and their arrows, their stones and their slings; and they were naked, save it 
were a skin which was girded about their loins; yea, all were naked, save it were the Zoramites and the 
Amalekites; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>43:21</b>   But they were not armed with breastplates, nor shields -- therefore, they 
were <span class="a">exceedingly</span> afraid of the armies of the Nephites because of their armor, 
notwithstanding their number being so much greater than the Nephites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1"><a href="exceed_list.html">Exceedingly</a> 
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>43:22</b>   <span class="a">Behold, now it came to pass</span> that they durst not come against the Nephites in the borders of 
Jershon; therefore they departed out of the land of Antionum into the wilderness, and took their journey round 
about in the wilderness, away by the head of the river Sidon, that they might come into the land of Manti and 
take possession of the land; for they did not suppose that the armies of Moroni would know whither they had gone. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>43:23</b>   <span class="a">But it came to pass</span>, as soon as they had departed into the wilderness Moroni sent spies 
into the wilderness to watch their camp; and Moroni, also, knowing of the prophecies of Alma, sent certain 
men unto him, desiring him that he should inquire of the Lord whither the armies of the Nephites should go 
to defend themselves against the Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>43:24</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the word of the Lord came unto Alma, and Alma 
informed the messengers of Moroni, that the armies of the Lamanites were marching round about in the wilderness, 
that they might come over into the land of Manti, that they might commence an attack upon the weaker part of the 
people.  And those messengers went and delivered the message unto Moroni. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>43:25</b>   Now Moroni, leaving a part of his army in the land of Jershon, lest by any means a part of 
the Lamanites should come into that land and take possession of the city, took the remaining part of his army 
and marched over into the land of Manti. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>43:26</b>   And he caused that all the people in that quarter of the land should gather themselves 
together to battle against the Lamanites, to defend their lands and their country, their rights and their 
liberties; therefore they were prepared against the time of the coming of the Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>43:27</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Moroni caused that his army should be 
secreted in the valley which was near the bank of the river Sidon, which was on the west of the river S
idon in the wilderness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>43:28</b>   And Moroni placed spies round about, that he might know when the camp of the Lamanites 
should come. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>43:29</b>   And now, as Moroni knew the intention of the Lamanites, that it was their intention to 
destroy their brethren, or to subject them and bring them into bondage that they might establish a kingdom 
unto themselves over all the land; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>43:30</b>   And he also knowing that it was the only desire of the Nephites to preserve their lands, and 
their liberty, and their church, therefore he thought it no sin that he should defend them by stratagem; 
therefore, he found by his spies which course the Lamanites were to take. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>43:31</b>   Therefore, he divided his army and brought a part over into the valley, and concealed them 
on the east, and on the south of the hill Riplah; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="32"></a>43:32</b>   And the remainder he concealed in the west valley, on the west of the river Sidon, and 
so down into the borders of the land Manti. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="33"></a>43:33</b>   And thus having placed his army according to his desire, he was prepared to meet them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="34"></a>43:34</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Lamanites came up on the north of the 
hill, where a part of the army of Moroni was concealed. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="35"></a>43:35</b>   And as the Lamanites had passed the hill Riplah, and came into the valley, and began to 
cross the river Sidon, the army which was concealed on the south of the hill, which was led by a man 
whose name was Lehi, and he led his army forth and encircled the Lamanites 
about on the east in their rear. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="36"></a>43:36</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Lamanites, when they saw the Nephites 
coming upon them in their rear, turned them about and began to contend with the army 
of Lehi. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="37"></a>43:37</b>   And the work of death commenced on both sides, but it was more dreadful on the 
part of <span class="i">the Lamanites</span>, for <span class="i">their nakedness was exposed</span> to the heavy blows of the Nephites with their <span class="sci">swords and their 
cimeters</span>, which brought death almost at every stroke. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/sci1.gif" width="32" height="32"><br>
<font size="-1">More metal swords, cimeters, and breastplates, none of which has ever been found. (43:37-38)
<p><img src="../../images/int.gif" width="32" height="32"><br>
<font size="-1">The Lamanites were, of course, naked.</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="38"></a>43:38</b>   While on the other hand, there was now and then a man fell among the Nephites, by their swords 
and the loss of blood, they being shielded from the more vital parts of the body, or the more vital parts of the 
body being shielded from the strokes of the Lamanites, by their <span class="sci">breastplates, and their arm-shields, and their 
head-plates</span>; and thus the Nephites did carry on the work of death among the Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="39"></a>43:39</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Lamanites became frightened, because of the 
great destruction among them, even until they began to flee towards the river Sidon. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="40"></a>43:40</b>   And they were pursued by Lehi and his men; and they were driven 
by Lehi into the waters of Sidon, and they crossed the waters of 
Sidon.  And Lehi retained his armies upon the bank of the river Sidon that they 
should not cross. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="41"></a>43:41</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Moroni and his army met the Lamanites in the 
valley, on the other side of the river Sidon, and began to fall upon them and to slay them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="42"></a>43:42</b>   And the Lamanites did flee again before them, towards the land of Manti; and they were met again 
by the armies of Moroni. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="43"></a>43:43</b>   Now in this case the Lamanites did fight <span class="a">exceedingly</span>; yea, never had the 
Lamanites been known to fight with such <span class="a">exceedingly</span> great strength and courage, no, not 
even from the beginning. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32"><br>
<font size="-1"><a href="../topics/twain.html">Exceedingly</a> 
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="44"></a>43:44</b>   And they were inspired by the Zoramites and the Amalekites, who were their chief captains 
and leaders, and by Zerahemnah, who was their chief captain, or their chief leader and commander; yea, they 
did fight like dragons, and many of the Nephites were slain by their hands, yea, for they did smite in two 
many of their head-plates, and they did pierce many of their breastplates, and they did smite off many of 
their arms; and thus the Lamanites did smite in their fierce anger. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="45"></a>43:45</b>   Nevertheless, the Nephites were inspired by a better cause, for they were not fighting for 
monarchy nor power but they were fighting for their homes and their liberties, their wives and their children, 
and their all, yea, for their rites of worship and their church. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="46"></a>43:46</b>   And they were doing that which they felt was the duty which they owed to their God; for the 
Lord had said unto them, and also unto their fathers, that: Inasmuch as ye are not guilty of the first offense, 
neither the second, ye shall not suffer yourselves to be slain by the hands of your enemies. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="47"></a>43:47</b>   And again, the Lord has said that: Ye shall defend your families even unto bloodshed.  
Therefore for this cause were the Nephites contending with the Lamanites, to defend themselves, and their 
families, and their lands, their country, and their rights, and their religion. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="48"></a>43:48</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when the men of Moroni saw the fierceness and 
the anger of the Lamanites, they were about to shrink and flee from them.  And Moroni, perceiving their intent, 
sent forth and inspired their hearts with these thoughts -- yea, the thoughts of their lands, their liberty, 
yea, their freedom from bondage. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="49"></a>43:49</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they turned upon the Lamanites, and they 
cried with one voice unto the Lord their God, for their liberty and their freedom from bondage. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="50"></a>43:50</b>   And they began to stand against the Lamanites with power; and in that selfsame hour that 
they cried unto the Lord for their freedom, the Lamanites began to flee before them; and they fled even to 
the waters of Sidon. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="51"></a>43:51</b>   Now, the Lamanites were more numerous, yea, by more than double the number of the Nephites; 
nevertheless, they were driven insomuch that they were gathered together in one body in the valley, upon the 
bank by the river Sidon. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="52"></a>43:52</b>   Therefore the armies of Moroni encircled them about, yea, even on both sides of the river, 
for behold, on the east were the men of Lehi. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="53"></a>43:53</b>   Therefore when Zerahemnah saw the men of Lehi on the east of 
the river Sidon, and the armies of Moroni on the west of the river Sidon, that they were encircled about by the 
Nephites, they were struck with terror. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="54"></a>43:54</b>   Now Moroni, when he saw their terror, commanded his men that they should stop shedding their 
blood. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
