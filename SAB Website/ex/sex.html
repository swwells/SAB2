<p><li>God decides to kill Moses because his son had not yet been circumcised. Luckily for Moses, his Egyptian wife Zipporah
"took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me. So
he [God] let him go." This story shows the importance of penises to God, and his hatred of foreskins.  <a href="4.html#24">4:24</a>

<p><li>Moses, like a coach giving instructions to the team before the big game, tells the men to "come not at your wives" before
he goes up to Mt. Sinai.  <a href="19.html#15">19:15</a>

<p><li>God tells the priests not to go up the steps to the altar "that thy nakedness not be discovered thereon." (Skirts on 
stairs <i>are</i> a problem.) <a href="20.html#26">20:26</a>

<p><li>"Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death." Is it really necessary to kill such people? Couldn't we just
send them to counseling or something?  <a href="22.html#19">22:19</a>

<p><li>Aaron makes a golden calf and tells the people to take off their clothes and dance around naked. God then punishes them
mercilessly for following their divinely appointed religious leader.  <a href="32.html#1">32:1-35</a>

<p><li>Aaron makes the people take off all their clothes and dance naked around his golden calf. 
<a href="32.html#25">32:25</a>

<p><li>"Their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods." God always blames the
women; it is they who "go a whoring" and then "make" the men "go a whoring."  <a href="34.html#16">34:16</a>
