<p><li>Inheritance laws: None of this makes sense to me, 
but <a href="http://www.answering-islam.org/Quran/Contra/i001.html">here's a link</a> that explains it all for you. 
<a href="index.htm#11">4:11-12</a>

<p><li>"We shall cast him into Fire, and that is ever easy for Allah." <a href="index.htm#30">4:30</a>

<p><li>Be kind to the slaves "whom your right hands possess." But, of course, if a kind person would set slaves free and wouldn't 
have them in the first place. <a href="index.htm#36">4:36</a>

<p><li>Don't make Satan your imaginary friend. Choose Allah instead! <a href="index.htm#38">4:38</a>

<p><li>If you get dirty (by touching a woman or something), and can't find any clean water 
around at prayer time, you can clean up by rubbing your face and hands in some clean 
dirt. <a href="index.htm#43">4:43</a>

<p><li>Christians and Jews must believe what Allah has revealed to Muhammad or Allah will disfigure their faces or
turn them into apes, as he did the Sabbath-breakers. (See 
<a href="../2/index.htm#65">2:65-66</a>) <a href="index.htm#47">4:47</a>

<p><li>Virgins (and plenteous shade) await those who enter paradise. <a href="index.htm#57">4:57</a>

<p><li>"We sent no messenger save that he should be obeyed by Allah's leave."</i> (Obey Muhammad.) <a href="index.htm#64">4:64</a>

<p><li>Don't worry about dying in battle. Remember the shade and the pure companions. Allah wouldn't hurt the down on a date-stone. 
<a href="index.htm#77">4:77</a>

<p><li> If something good happens to you, it is because of Allah. If something bad happens, it's your own damn fault. Heads, 
Allah wins; tails, you lose. <a href="index.htm#78">4:78-79</a>

<p><li>"Whoso obeyeth the messenger hath obeyed Allah, and whoso turneth away: We have not sent thee as a warder over them." 
<a href="index.htm#80">4:80</a>

<p><li>"Will they not then ponder on the Qur'an? If it had been from other than Allah they would have found therein much incongruity."<br>
If the Quran was not from Allah its critics would find some mistakes in it.(The Quran filled with mistakes. It is a silly, error-filled book. But even if 
the Quran didn't contain a single error, it would not prove that it was from Allah.) <a href="index.htm#82">4:82</a>

<p><li>"If it had not been for the grace of Allah upon you and His mercy ye would have followed Satan, save a few (of you)."<br>
Most of us would be followers of Satan if it wasn't for Allah. <a href="index.htm#83">4:83</a>

<p><li>Whoever participates in a good cause, will be rewarded.
Whoever participates in an evil cause, will bear the consequences thereof. (It's not true, but it's a nice thought.) 
<a href="index.htm#85">4:85</a>

<p><li>If someone says Hi to you say Hi (or Howdy) back to them. <a href="index.htm#86">4:86</a>

<p><li>"Who enjoineth almsgiving and kindness and peace-making ... We shall bestow ... a vast reward."<br>
It is good to help the poor and make peace. (But the part about Allah giving you a big reward for doing so is a big lie.) 
<a href="index.htm#114">4:114</a>

<p><li>Don't cut cattle's ears and, thereby, change Allah's creation. 
(<a href="http://www.muslimconverts.com/cosmetics/plucking_eyebrows.htm">This is interpreted</a> to mean that Muslim men must not shave 
their beards, and Muslim women must not pluck their eyebrows.) Allah commands non-Muslims 
to shave beards and pluck eyebrows so he can have an excuse to burn them in hell after they die.
 <a href="index.htm#119">4:119-121</a>
 
 <p><li>Allah will not allow disbelievers to succeed against believers. 
<a href="index.htm#141">4:141</a>

<p><li>Jesus was not crucified. (It just looked like he was.) <a href="index.htm#157">4:157-8</a>
