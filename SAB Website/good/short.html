<h4>Ecclesiastes</h4>

<p><li>There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in 
his labour. -- <a href="../ec/2.html#24">2:24</a>

<p><li>Every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour. 
-- <a href="../ec/3.html#13">3:13</a>

<p><li>A man hath no pre-eminence above a beast ... All goeth unto one place ... Who knoweth the spirit 
of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth? 
-- <a href="../ec/3.html#19">3:19-21</a>

<p><li>Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works. 
-- <a href="../ec/3.html#2">3:22</a>

<p><li>As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall 
take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand -- <a href="../ec/5.html#15">5:15</a>

<p><li>It is good and comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under
the sun all the days of his life. -- <a href="../ec/5.html#18">5:18</a>

<p><li>It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools. 
-- <a href="../ec/7.html#5">7:5</a>

<p><li>Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools. 
-- <a href="../ec/7.html#9">7:9</a>

<p><li>A man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry. 
-- <a href="../ec/8.html#15">8:15</a>

<p><li>For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they 
any more a reward. -- <a href="../ec/9.html#5">9:5</a>

<p><li>Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart. 
-- <a href="../ec/9.html#7">9:7</a>

<p><li>Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest. 
-- <a href="../ec/9.html#9">9:9</a>

<p><li>Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might;for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in
     the grave, whither thou goest. -- <a href="../ec/9.html#10">9:10</a>
     
<p><li>The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of 
understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all. For man also knoweth not his time: 
as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared 
in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them. -- <a href="../ec/9.html#11">9:11-12</a>

<h4>Zechariah</h4>
<p><li>Execute true judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother: And oppress not the widow, nor the

heart. -- <a href="../zech/7.html#9">7:9-10</a>

<p><li>These are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and 
peace in your gates: And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour; and love no false 
oath. -- <a href="../zech/8.html#16">8:16-17</a>

<h4>Matthew</h4>
<p><li>Love your enemies. -- <a href="../mt/5.html#44">5:44</a>

<p><li>Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee.... But when thou doest alms, let not thy 
left hand know what thy right hand doeth: -- <a href="../mt/6.html#2">6:2-3</a>

<p><li>And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the
     corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their 
     reward. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy
     Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. -- <a href="../mt/6.html#5">6:5-6</a>
     
<p><li>Judge not, that ye be not judged. -- <a href="../mt/7.html#1">7:1</a>

<p><li>And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?
Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?
Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy 
brother's eye. -- <a href="../mt/7.html#3">7:3-5</a>

<p><li>All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them. 
-- <a href="../mt/7.html#12">7:12</a>

<p><li>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. -- <a href='../mt/22.html#39'>22:29</a>


<h4>Mark</h4>
<p><li>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. -- <a href='../mk/12.html#31'>12 31:</a>

<h4>Luke</h4>
<p><li>Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you. -- <a href="../lk/6.html#27">6:27</a>

<p><li>As ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise. 
-- <a href="../lk/6.html#31">6:31</a>

<p><li>But love ye your enemies, and do good ... hoping for nothing again.  
-- <a href="../lk/6.html#35">6:35</a>

<p><li>Be ye therefore merciful. -- <a href="../mt/6.html#36">6:36</a>

<p><li>Judge not, and ye shall not be judged. -- <a href="../lk/6.html#37">6:37</a>

<p><li>And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?
... Cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt 
thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye. 
-- <a href="../mk/6.html#41">6:41-42</a>

<p><li> A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him,
     and departed, leaving him half dead.... 
     But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him, 
     And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an 
     inn, and took care of him. 
     And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of 
     him; and whatsoever thou
     spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.... 
      Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise. -- <a href="../lk/10.html#30">10:30-37</a>
