<tr><td><B><A name="4">1:4</a></b> And when he was younger than any of the tribe of Nephtali, yet did he no childish thing in his work. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><B><A name="5">1:5</a></b> Moreover when all went to the golden calves which Jeroboam king of Israel had made, he alone fled the company of all,<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><B><A name="6">1:6</a></b> And went to Jerusalem to the temple of the Lord, and there adored the Lord God of Israel, offering faithfully all his

<tr><td><B><A name="7">1:7</a></b> So that in the third year he gave all his tithes to the proselytes, and strangers. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><B><A name="8">1:8</a></b> These and such like things did he observe when but a boy according to the law of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><B><A name="9">1:9</a></b> But when he was a man, he took to wife Anna of his own tribe, and had a son by her, 
whom he called after his own name, <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><B><A name="10">1:10</a></b> And from his infancy he taught him to fear God, and to abstain from all sin.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><B><A name="14">1:14</a></b> And he gave him leave to go whithersoever he would, with liberty to do whatever he had a mind. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Because of King Sennacherib's blasphemy, God slaughtered lots of Assyrians, who then retaliated by killing Israelites, which Tobias 
promptly buried. When the king found out about it (Tobias burying the dead bodies), he commanded Tobias to be killed and confiscated 
all his stuff. But Tobias ran away naked with his son (Tobias Jr.) and wife.

<p>(1:21) <i>"When king Sennacherib was come back, fleeing from Judea by reason of 
<b>the slaughter that God had made</b> about 
him <b>for his blasphemy</b>, and being angry slew many of the children of Israel, Tobias buried their bodies."</i>

<p>(1:22) <i>But when it was told the king, he commanded him to be slain, and took away all his substance.</i>
