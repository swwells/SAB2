<p><li> God will send enemy nations against his "chosen people." <a href="1.html#14">1:14-15</a>

<p><li>Those who worship "other gods" are wicked. "I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, 
who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods." <a href="1.html#16">1:16</a>

<p><li>"They shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee." <a href="1.html#19">1:19</a>

<p><li> God tries to "correct" people by killing their children.  <a href="2.html#30">2:30</a>

<p><li>God tries to reform people by tormenting them and then wonders why it doesn't work. <a href="5.html#3">5:3</a>

<p><li> Those who don't follow or know God are "poor" and "foolish."  <a href="5.html#4">5:4</a>

<p><li>"How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have ... committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses." 
<a href="5.html#7">5:7</a>

<p><li>God will burn the people to death for discovering his non-existence. <a href="5.html#14">5:14</a>

<p><li> God again talks of bringing a foreign nation to destroy his chosen ones and their lands.  
<a href="5.html#15">5:15-17</a>

<p><li>God just can't hold in his fury any longer. He will kill everyone: husbands and wives, children and old people.
<a href="6.html#11">6:11</a>

<p><li> God "will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts" because they refuse to do 
whatever the hell he asks them to do. <a href="6.html#19">6:19</a> 

<p><li>God says that there are some people that you just shouldn't bother 
praying for. And if you do he won't listen anyway. <a href="7.html#16">7:16</a>

<p><li>God is angered by children who gather wood, fathers who make fires, 
and women that make bread for the "queen of heaven" (Mary?) and other gods. <a href="7.html#18">7:18</a>

<p><li> God will pour out his anger on both man and beast. Not even the trees will 
be spared from his wrath. And the ground itself will burn forever.  <a href="7.html#20">7:20</a>

<p><li> Don't trust anyone. Not even your neighbors, family, or friends. Those who 
believe differently than you are all liars and evil doers. <a href="9.html#4">9:4-6</a>

<p><li> "Learn not the way of the heathen." <a href="10.html#2">10:2</a>

<p><li> If any nation does not listen to God, he "will utterly pluck up and destroy that 
nation." <a href="12.html#17">12:17</a>

<p><li>Apparently, the point of the girdle story (<a href="13.html#1">13:1-7</a>) was to say that 
worshipping other gods "is good for nothing." <a href="13.html#10">13:10</a>

<p><li> God plans to make everyone in the kingdom drunk and then "dash the fathers and the sons 
together." The merciful God of peace vows to "not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy them."  <a href="13.html#12">13:12-14</a>

<p><li>God tells Jeremiah not to pray for the people. God has decided to kill them all and he doesn't want to 
be talked out of it. <a href="14.html#11">14:11</a>

<p><li> God will destroy by famine and sword those who are misled by the prophets, as well as the prophets 
themselves.  <a href="14.html#15">14:15-16</a>

<p><li>God has it all planned out. He'll kill some with the sword, some with famine, and he'll feed the rest to the dogs and birds.

<a href="17.html#27">17:27</a>

<p><li>For worshipping "other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known," God will make 
parents eat their own children, and friends each other. Then he'll feed whoever's left to the birds. 
<a href="19.html#4">19:4, 7-9</a>

<p><li>God will break those who worship other gods as though they were made of clay, killing 
so many that there will not be enough room to bury them all. <a href="19.html#11">19:11-13</a>

<p><li>"Thus saith the LORD ... I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against

<p><li>God will kill those who refuse listen to his prophets. <a href="29.html#19">29:19</a>

<p><li>To punish the people for refusing to free their slaves, God over-reacts (just a tad) by 
threatening to send the sword, pestilence, and 
famine, saying he'll feed their dead bodies to the fowls and beasts of the earth. <a href="34.html#17">34:17-20</a>

<p><li>God explains why he had to bring evil on Judah: the people burned incense to other gods. <a href="44.html#2">44:2-8</a>

<p><li>God's not finished with Judah. He'll bring more evil upon them. Even those Jews that flee to Egypt will not be spared. 
God will hunt them down and kill them all with war, famine, and disease.   <a href="44.html#11">44:11-13</a>

<p><li>God is going to do some really bad things to the people because the women burned incense to the "Queen of 
Heaven" (Mary?). <a href="44.html#15">44:15-25</a>

<p><li>"I will punish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and their kings; even Pharaoh, and all them that trust in him."

<a href="49.html#37">49:37</a>

<p><li>"I have laid a snare for thee ... O Babylon, and thou wast not aware ... because thou hast striven against the LORD."
<a href="50.html#24">50:24</a>

<a href="50.html#25">50:25</a>

<p><li>"Destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left." <a href="50.html#26">50:26</a>

<p><li>"Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them!" <a href="50.html#27">50:27</a>

<p><li>Call together the archers against Babylon ... let none thereof escape." <a href="50.html#29">50:29</a>
