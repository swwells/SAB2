<p><li> After Solomon died, his son Rehoboam became king, and everyone in Israel came to talk to him, begging him to 
not be the jerk his father was. Rehoboam said that he'd be even nastier. His dad laid heavy burdens upon them and tortured 
them with whips; he would torture them with scorpions. If Solomon had a big dick, Rehoboam has an even bigger one.
