<p><li>Long, tiresome, and disgusting instructions regarding the treatment of men who have a
"running issue" out of their "flesh." Very enlightening. "And if he that hath the issue spit upon him
that is clean...."  <a href="15.html#1">15:1-15</a>

<p><li>"If any man's seed of copulation go out from him...." (God's law for wet dreams)<br>
This passage tells you what to do if you get your "seed of copulation" on yourself,
your clothes, or your partner. Thank God this is in the Bible.  
<a href="15.html#16">15:16-18</a>, <a href="15.html#32">32</a>

<p><li>"If any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he shall ... be unclean until the even." <a href="15.html#16">15:16</a>

<p><li>"And every garment ... whereon is the seed of copulation, shall be ... unclean until the even."  <a href="15.html#17">15:17</a>

<p><li>"The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water, 
and be unclean until the even." <a href="15.html#18">15:18</a>

<p><li>Don't "uncover the nakedness" of any of your relatives or neighbors. Just ask them
to keep their clothes on while you are around.  <a href="18.html#6">18:6-18, 20</a>

<p><li>"Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is
apart for her uncleanness," Don't even look at a menstruating woman. 
 <a href="18.html#19">18:19</a>
 
<p><li>Don't "lie with any beast." You probably weren't planning on doing this, but now 
you know just in case you get the urge sometime.  <a href="18.html#23">18:23</a>

<p><li>If you upset God, he'll cause the land to vomit you out. 
 <a href="18.html#25">18:25</a>
 
<p><li>Don't "go a whoring" after Molech or "commit adultery with him." (Don't you love it
when God talks dirty?)  <a href="20.html#5">20:5</a>

<p><li>Stay away from people with familiar spirits and don't "go a whoring" 
after them either. <a href="20.html#6">20:6</a>

<p><li>A man with damaged testicles must not "come nigh to offer the bread of his God." 
 <a href="21.html#20">21:20</a>
 
<p><li>A man who is unclean, or is a leper, or  has a "running issue", or "whose seed goeth from
him",  or who touches any dead or "creeping thing" ... "shall not eat of the holy things, until he be
clean."  <a href="22.html#3">22:3-5</a>
