<i>God's rules for buying slaves and splitting up their families.</i><br> 
You can buy one, but you must set him free on the seventh year. If
you have &quot;given&quot; him a wife and she bears children, then you get to
keep the wife and kids. If he refuses to leave his family when his seven years
are up, then bore a hole though his ear and keep him forever. (That sounds

It's okay with God if you slowly beat your slaves to death. After all, they are your money. 
Just make sure that they survive at least a day or two after the beating. 
But try not to knock out their teeth or eyes. Otherwise you may have to set them free. <br>

If two men fight and cause a woman to
miscarry, but do not hurt her, then the one who hurt her shall pay her husband
an amount determined by the judges. Only if the woman dies is the punishment to
be death. Apparently, then, with respect to abortion, God is pro-choice since he
considers a woman's life to be more important than that of the fetus.<br>

  And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they shall sell the
    live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also they shall divide.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="36">21:36</A></B>
  Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and his
    owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the dead
    shall be his own.
