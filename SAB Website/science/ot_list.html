<p><b><a href="../gen/sci_list.html">Genesis</a></b>


<p><li>"In the beginning" <a href="../gen/1.html#1">1:1</a><br>
<a href="../interp/universe.html">When was the universe created?</a> 

<p><li>"In the beginning" <a href="../gen/1.html#1">1:1-2</a><br>
<a href="../interp/gap.html">The Gap Theory</a> 

<p><li>The Genesis 1 creation account conflicts with the order of events that are known to science. In 
Genesis, the earth is created before light and stars, birds and whales before reptiles and insects,
and flowering plants before any animals. The order of events known from science is just the 
opposite. <a href="../gen/1.html#1">1:1-2:3</a>

<p><li>God creates light and separates light from darkness, and day from night, on the first day.
Yet he didn't make the light producing objects (the sun and the stars) until the fourth day
(<a href="../gen/1.html#14">1:14-19</a>). And how could there be "the evening and the morning" on the 
first day if there was no sun to mark them? <a href="../gen/1.html#3">1:3-5</a>

<p><li>God spends one-sixth of his entire creative effort (the second day) 
working on a solid firmament. This strange structure, which God calls heaven, is 
intended to separate the higher waters from the lower waters.  <a href="../gen/1.html#6">1:6-8</a>

<p><li>Plants are made on the third day before there was a sun to drive their photosynthetic
processes (<a href="../gen/1.html#14">1:14-19</a>).  <a href="../gen/1.html#11">1:11</a>

<p><li>God lets &quot;the earth bring forth&quot; the plants, rather than creating them directly. 
Maybe Genesis is not so anti-evolution after all. <a href="../gen/1.html#11">1:11</a>

<p><li> In an apparent endorsement of astrology, God places the sun, moon, and stars in the firmament so that they can be used
"for signs". This, of course, is exactly what astrologers do: read "the signs" in the Zodiac in an effort to predict what 
will happen on Earth. <a href="../gen/1.html#14">1:14</a>

<p><li>God makes two lights: "the greater light [the sun] to rule the day, and the lesser light [the moon] to rule the night." But
the moon is not a light, but only reflects light from the sun. And why, if God made the moon to "rule the night", does it spend
half of its time moving through the daytime sky? <a href="../gen/1.html#16">1:16</a>

<p><li> &quot;He made the stars also.&quot; God spends a day making light (before making the stars) and separating light 
from darkness; then, at the end of a hard day's work, and almost as an afterthought, he makes
the trillions of stars. <a href="../gen/1.html#16">1:16</a>

<p><li>"And God set them [the stars] in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the 
earth." <a href="../gen/1.html#17">1:17</a>

<p><li>In verse 11, God "let the earth bring forth" the plants. Now he has the earth "bring forth" the animals as well. So maybe 
the creationists have it all wrong. Maybe God created livings things through the process of evolution. 
<a href="../gen/1.html#24">1:24</a>

<p><li>God gave humans dominion over every other living thing on earth. <a href="../gen/1.html#26">1:26</a>

<p><li>God commands us to "be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have
     dominion over ... every living thing that moveth upon the earth.&quot; <a href="../gen/1.html#28">1:28</a>

<p><li>"I have given you every herb ... and every tree ... for meat."<br>
Since many plants have evolved poisons to protect against animals that would like to eat them, God's advice is more than a little reckless. 
Would you tell your children to go out in the garden and eat whatever plants they encounter? Of course not. But then, you are much nicer 
and smarter than God.   <a href="../gen/1.html#29">1:29</a>
     
<p><li>All animals were originally herbivores. Tapeworms, vampire bats, 
mosquitoes, and barracudas -- all were strict vegetarians, as they were created 
by God. <a href="../gen/1.html#30">1:30</a>

<p><li>"God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good." He purposefully designed a system 
that ensures the suffering and death of all his creatures, parasite and host, predator and prey. <a href="../gen/1.html#31">1:31</a>

<p><li>In Genesis 1 the entire creation takes 6 days, but the
universe is at least 12 billion years old, with new stars constantly being formed. <a href="../gen/1.html#31">1:31</a>

<p><li>Humans were not created instantaneously from dust and breath, but
evolved over millions of years from simpler life forms. <a href="../gen/2.html#7">2:7</a>

<p><li>After making the animals, God has
Adam name them all. The naming of several million species must have kept Adam busy for a
while.  <a href="../gen/2.html#18">2:18-22</a>

 <p><li>God fashions a woman out of one of Adam's ribs. <br>
Because of this story, it was commonly believed (and sometimes it is still said today) that males have one less 
rib than females. When Vesalius showed in 1543 that the number of ribs was the same in males and females, it created a storm 
of controversy. <a href="../gen/2.html#19">2:19</a>

<p><li>God curses the serpent. From now on the serpent will crawl on his belly and eat dust.
One wonders how he got around before -- by hopping on his tail, perhaps? But snakes don't
eat dust, do they?  <a href="../gen/3.html#14">3:14</a>

<p><li>Because Adam listened to Eve, God cursed the ground and causes thorns and thistles to grow. Before this,
according to the (false) Genesis story, plants had no natural defenses. The rose had no thorn, cacti were spineless, holly
leaves were smooth, and the nettle had no sting. Foxgloves, oleander, and 
milkweeds were all perfectly safe to eat. <a href="../gen/3.html#17">3:17-18</a>

<p><li>When Lamech was born, nine generations were alive at once. Adam, Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, Methuselah, and Lamech were all alive at 
the time of Lamech's birth. Adam lived to see his great-great-great-great-great-great-grandson. <a href="../gen/5.html#25">5:25</a>

<p><li><i>"There were giants in the earth in those days."</i>
 <a href="../gen/6.html#4">6:4</a>
 
<p><li>Noah is told to make an ark that is 450 feet long. <a href="../gen/6.html#14">6:14-15</a>
<p><li>Whether by twos or by sevens, Noah takes male and female representatives from each
species of "every thing that creepeth upon the earth." <a href="../gen/7.html#8">7:8</a>

<p><li>God opens the "windows of heaven." He does this every time it rains. 
  <a href="../gen/7.html#11">7:11</a>
  
<p><li>All of the animals boarded the ark "in the selfsame day."  <a href="../gen/7.html#13">7:13-14</a>

<p><li>The flood covered the highest mountain tops (Mount Everest?) with fifteen cubits to
spare.  <a href="../gen/7.html#20">7:20</a>

<p><li>"The windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from  heaven was restrained." This 
happens whenever it stops raining. <a href="../gen/8.html#2">8:2</a>

<p><li>Noah sends a dove out to see if there was any dry land. But the dove returns without
finding any. Then, just seven days later, the dove goes out again and returns with an olive leaf.
But how could an olive tree survive the flood? And if any seeds happened to survive, they
certainly wouldn't germinate and grow leaves within a seven day period. 
 <a href="../gen/8.html#8">8:8-11</a>
 
<p><li>When the animals left the ark, what would they have eaten? There would have been no
plants after the ground had been submerged for nearly a year. What would the carnivores have
eaten? Whatever prey they ate would have gone extinct. And how did the New World
primates or the Australian marsupials find their way back after the flood 
subsided? <a href="../gen/8.html#19">8:19</a>

<p><li><i>"And the Lord smelled a sweet savor."</i><br>
Noah kills the "clean beasts" and burns their dead bodies for God. According to 
<a href="../gen/7.html#8">7:8</a> this would have caused the extinction of all "clean" animals since only two of each were 
taken onto the ark.  <a href="../gen/8.html#20">8:20-21</a>

<p><li>"Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth." Although this would have been good advice for the mythical Noah, it 
is deadly advice for humankind as a whole. Overpopulation is one of our greatest problems, yet there is nothing in the bible to address it. 
<a href="../gen/9.html#1">9:1</a> 

<p><li>According to this verse, all animals fear humans. Although it is true that many do, it is also 
true that some do not. Sharks and grizzly bears, for example, are generally much 
less afraid of us than we are of them. <a href="../gen/9.html#2">9:2</a>

<p><li><i>"Into your hand are they (the animals) delivered."</i><br>
God gave the animals to humans, and they can do whatever 
they please with them. This verse has been used by bible believers to justify all kinds of cruelty to 
animals and environmental destruction. <a href="../gen/9.html#2">9:2</a>

<p><li>God is rightly filled with remorse for having killed his creatures. He even puts the
rainbow in the sky to remind himself of his promise to the animals not
to do it again. But rainbows are caused by the nature of light, the refractive index of water, and the shape of
raindrops. There were rainbows billions of years before humans existed.  
<a href="../gen/9.html#13">9:13</a>

<p><li><a href="http://www.aaronc.com/daypeleg.html">Some creationists</a> believe that this 
verse refers to continental drift, which, they say, began to occur during the days of Pelag (which means "division"), about 100 or so years after the 
flood. But many other creationists <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/peleg.html">disagree</a>. 
<a href="../gen/10.html#25">10:25</a>

<p><li>&quot;The whole earth was of one language.&quot; But this could not be true, since by this time (around 2400 BCE) 
there were already many languages, each unintelligible to the others. <a href="../gen/11.html#1">11:1</a>, <a href="../gen/11.html#6">6</a>

<p><li><i>"Now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do."</i></b><br>
God worries that people could build a tower high enough to reach him (them?) in heaven, and that by 
so doing they will become omnipotent.  <a href="../gen/11.html#4">11:4-6</a>

<p><li>According to the Tower of Babel story, the many human languages were created
instantaneously by God. But actually the various languages evolved gradually over long periods of
time. <a href="../gen/11.html#9">11:9</a>

<p><li>The ridiculously long lives of the patriarchs. <a href="../gen/11.html#10">11:10-32</a>

<p><li>"Abram ... pursued them unto Dan."<br>
This is an obvious anachronism, since the city of Dan was not named "Dan" until the time of the Judges 
(see <a href="../jg/18.html#29">Judges 18:29</a>). In fact, Dan (for whom the city 
was named) was not even born yet (see <a href="../gen/30.html#6">Genesis 30:6</a>). <a href="../gen/14.html#14">14:14</a>

<p><li> "And they returned to the land of the Philistines." 
But the Philistines didn't arrive in the region of Canaan until around 1200 BCE -- 
800 years after Abraham's supposed migration from Ur. <a href="../gen/21.html#32">21:32</a>,

<p><li>Laban learns "by experience" that God has blessed him for Jacob's sake. "By experience" 
means "by divination", at least that is how 
<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Genesis+30%3A27&x=12&y=10&NIV_version=yes&NASB_version=yes&ESV_version=yes&CEV_version=yes&language=english">most other versions</a> translate this verse.
 <a href="../gen/30.html#27">30:27</a>
 
<p><li>Jacob displays his (and God's) knowledge of biology by having goats copulate while
looking at streaked rods. The result is streaked baby goats.  <a href="../gen/30.html#37">30:37-39</a>

<p><li>God (or an angel) praises Jacob for his fancy genetic work in <a href="../gen/30.html#37">Gen.30:37-39</a>.

    basket</a>) <a href="../ex/2.html#3">2:3</a>
    
<p><li>It took the Israelites 40 years to travel from Egypt to Canaan, yet such a journey, even at that time, 
would have taken no more than ten days. <a href="../ex/16.html#35">16:35</a>

<p><li>"In six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them."</i><br>
Believers often say that the "days" of creation should be taken allegorically, but this verse is quite clear. God created the

<p><li>Four-legged fowls are abominations. <a href="../lev/11.html#20">11:20</a>

<p><li>Be sure to watch out for those "other flying creeping things which have four feet." (I wish
God wouldn't get so technical!) I guess he must mean four-legged insects. You'd think that since
God made the insects, and so many of them (at least several million species), that he would know
how many legs they have!  <a href="../lev/11.html#23">11:23</a>

<p><li>God's law for lepers: Get two birds. Kill one. Dip the live bird in the blood of the
dead one. Sprinkle the blood on the leper seven times, and then let the blood-soaked bird fly off.
Next find a lamb and kill it. Wipe some of its blood on the patient's right ear, thumb, and big toe.
Sprinkle seven times with oil and wipe some of the oil on his right ear, thumb and big toe.
Repeat. Finally kill a couple doves and offer one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt
offering.  <a href="../lev/14.html#2">14:2-52</a>

    tents. When the cloud started moving again, the Israelites followed it. <a href="../num/9.html#16">9:16-23</a>

<p><li>God sends quails to feed his people until they were "two cubits [about a meter] high upon the face of the earth." Taking
the "face of the earth" to be a circle with a radius of say 30 kilometers (an approximate day's journey), this would amount to 3
trillion (3x10<sup>12</sup>) liters of quails. At 2 quails per liter, this would provide a couple million quails for each of several million
people.  <a href="../num/11.html#31">11:31</a>

<p><li>&quot;And there we saw the giants
... And we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their

exaggeration, or an actual description of the sons of Anak, in which case they must have been
about 100 meters tall.  These are the same giants (the Nephilium) that resulted 
when the &quot;sons of God&quot; mated with &quot;the daughters of men in 
<a href="../gen/6.html#4">Gen.6:4</a>. Of course these superhuman god-men should have been

<p><li>"Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble."<br>
The earth rests upon pillars and doesn't move (unless God gets angry or something). <a href="../job/9.html#6">9:6</a>

<p><li>"Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not."<br>
The earth is fixed and the sun travels about it. <a href="../job/9.html#7">9:7</a>

<p><li>"The measure thereof is longer than the earth."<br>
What is the length of a sphere? <a href="../job/11.html#9">11:9</a>

<p><li>Heaven is set upon pillars that tremble when God gets mad. <a href="../job/26.html#11">26:11</a>

<p><li>"By the breath of God frost is given." <a href="../job/37.html#10">37:10</a>

<p><li>God spread out the sky, which is a solid structure, hard and strong like a mirror. <a href="../job/37.html#18">37:18</a>

<p><li>The earth is set on foundations and it does not move. <a href="../job/38.html#4">38:4-6</a>

<p><li>"That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be
    shaken out of it."<br>
        God could (if he wanted to) pick up the earth by its ends and shake all the wicked people off of it.<br>
 <a href="../job/38.html#13">38:13</a>

<p><li>God has snow and hail stored up to use later in time of trouble and war.  <a href="../job/38.html#22">38:22</a>

<p><li>"Out of whose womb came the ice?"<br>
Gosh, I don't know. Was it Glinda, the Good Witch of the North? <a href="../job/38.html#29">38:29</a>

<p><li>"Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion?"<br>
God seems pleased to have created prey for lions and ravens to eat. <a href="../job/38.html#39">38:39-41</a>

<p><li>"Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee?" The unicorn referred to here is probably not the single-horned mythical creature, but rather 
a wild ox that was mistranslated in the KJV. <a href="../job/39.html#9">39:9-10</a>

<p><li>  <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/65/os/ostrich.html">Ostriches</a> 
are not cruel and stupid birds who abandon their eggs to die after laying them, as these verses 
imply. They are, in fact, careful and attentive parents. The male scoops out a hollow for the eggs, 
which are incubated by the female during the day and the male at night. After the eggs are hatched, 
they are cared for by the mother for over a month, at which time the chicks can keep up with running 
adults. <a href="../job/39.html#13">39:13-16</a>
<p><li> The bible is wrong about ostriches being cruel and inattentive parents 
(<a href="../job/39.html#13">39:13-16</a>). But if they were, whose fault would it be? Why would God deprive 
them of the tools that are needed to do the job right? <a href="../job/39.html#17">39:17</a>

<p><li>"The eagle ... seeketh the prey.... Her young ones suck up blood."<br>
  God is pleased with the way that predators kill and devour their prey. <a href="../job/39.html#27">39:27-30</a>

<p><li>Bible believers have identified the behemoth as a hippopotamus, dinosaur, wildebeest, or 
crocodile. But my favorite is the way these verses are 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060969598/skepticsannotate/104-1593784-1808756">translated 
by Stephen Mitchell</a>: &quot;Look now: the Beast that I 
made: he eats grass like a bull. Look: the power in his thighs, the pulsing 
sinews of his belly. His penis stiffens like a pine; his testicles bulge with 
vigor.&quot; <a href="../job/40.html#15">40:15-16</a>

<p><li>"Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord?" <a href="../job/41.html#1">41:1</a>

<p><li>"His [the leviathan's] teeth are terrible round about."<br>
    God has equipped predators with teeth that tear the flesh of their prey. <a href="../job/41.html#14">41:14</a>

<a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2006/11/jesus-will-search-your-kidneys.html">Jesus will 
search your kidneys</a> <a href="../ps/7.html#9">7:9</a>

<p><li>"My reins also instruct me in the night seasons."<br>
The Psalmist's kidneys (reins) instruct him at night. <a href="../ps/16.html#7">16:7</a>

<p><li> The earth shakes whenever God really gets mad.  <a href="../ps/18.html#7">18:7</a>

<p><li> &quot;The foundations of the world were
discovered ... at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.&quot; (The earth is set on firm foundations 
and does not move -- unless God blows his nose.) <a href="../ps/18.html#15">18:15</a>

<p><li>"He maketh them also to skip ... like a young unicorn." <a href="../ps/29.html#6">29:6</a>

<p><li>From his seat in heaven, God can see the whole earth and all its inhabitants. <br>(He sits directly 
  above the earth, which is a flat disc below him.) <a href="../ps/33.html#14">33:14-15</a>
  
<p><li>Diseases are sent by God to punish sin. <a href="../ps/38.html#3">38:3</a>

<p><li>"I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field
    are mine. ... The world is mine, and the fulness thereof."<br>
    God takes credit for the entire creation. Preadators, prey, parasite, and host: God purposefully 
    designed them all. <a href="../ps/50.html#11">50:11-12</a>

<p><li>According to the psalmist, snails melt. But they don't, of course, they simply leave a slimy trail as they move
along.  <a href="../ps/58.html#8">58:8</a>

<p><li><"The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: even
    Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God." <a href="../ps/68.html#8">68:8</a>

<p><li>"I was pricked in my reins."<br>
("Reins" means kidneys in the Bible.) <a href="../ps/73.html#21">73:21</a>

<p><li>God is so strong that he can break the head of dragons and of leviathan. 
<a href="../ps/74.html#13">74:13-14</a>

<p><li>"Thou has set all the borders of the earth"<br>
A spherical earth has no borders. <a href="../ps/74.html#17">74:17</a>

<p><li>God holds the earth up with pillars.  <a href="../ps/75.html#3">75:3</a>

<p><li>"The earth trembled and shook."<br>
    Thunder, lightning, and earthquakes are the voice of God. <a href="../ps/77.html#18">77:18</a>
    
<p><li>"He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea."<br>
    See <a href="../num/11.html#20">Numbers 11:20-32</a>, where God sends quails to feed the Israelites until it literally came out their 
    noses. <a href="../ps/78.html#27">78:27</a>   

<p><li>Another reference to "the foundations of the earth", implying that the earth is fixed and 
does not move. <a href="../ps/82.html#5">82:5</a>

<p><li>"I will make mention of Rahab"<br>
    Rahab is a sea-demon or dragon from ancient Jewish folklore. <a href="../ps/87.html#4">87:4</a>

<p><li>"Thou hast broken Rahab [the sea monster] in pieces." <a href="../ps/89.html#10">89:10</a>

<p><li>"The world also is established, that it cannot be moved." <a href="../ps/93.html#1">93:1</a>

<p><li>"The world also shall be established that it shall not be moved." <a href="../ps/96.html#10">96:10</a>

<p><li>"The Lord ... who healeth all thy diseases." God heals all diseases. Medical science is 
unnecessary. <a href="../ps/103.html#2">103:2-3</a>

<p><li>"God ... who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain" 
(The earth is stationary and does not orbit the sun.) <a href="../ps/104.html#5">104:5</a>

<p><li>"The waters stood above the mountains."<br>
Noah's flood covered the highest mountains, just like it says in <a href="../gen/7.html#20">Genesis 7:20</a>.   <a href="../ps/105.html#6">104:6-7</a>

"The young lions roar
    after their prey, and seek their meat from God."</i><br>
God gives the lions their meat. The cruelty and brutality of nature are all part of God's plan.

<p><li><a href="http://home.austarnet.com.au/stear/python.htm">"In wisdom hast thou made them all."</a> 
<a href="../ps/104.html#24">104:24</a>

<p><li>God is offended by those who make things with their hands or invent things with their minds.
 <a href="../ps/106.html#39">106:39</a>
 
<p><li>"The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works." Then why do nearly 
all animals die painful deaths from starvation, predation, or disease long before they reach adulthood? 
<a href="../ps/145.html#9">145:9</a>

<p><li>God "satisfiest the desire of every living thing." But in nature few needs are met 
and few desires are satisfied. Life is short, hard, cruel, and painful for nearly every living
thing. <a href="../ps/145.html#17">145:17</a>

<p><li><i>"He calleth them all by their names."</i><br>
God knows how many stars there are and knows them all by name. That's pretty impressive since there are 100 billion or so gallaxies, 
each containing about 100 billion stars. <a href="../ps/147.html#7">147:7</a>

<p><li>Even the dragons praise the Lord.  <a href="../ps/148.html#7">148:7</a>

 <p><li>"Praise him in the firmament of his power." 
 <a href="../ps/150.html#1">150:1</a>

<p><li>"Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding."<br>
A special anthem was composed from these words for Darwin's funeral at Westminster Abbey.  <a href="../pr/3.html#13">3:13</a>

Humans can't figure things out on their own. <a href="../pr/20.html#24">20:24</a>

A wise king will crush those that he considers "wicked." <a href="../pr/20.html#26">20:26</a>

<strong>[../tapitcode.html]</strong><p><b><a href="../ec/sci_list.html">Ecclesiastes</a></b>


<p><li>"The sun also ariseth"<br>
Although this verse is interpreted figuratively today, it was taken literally by virtually all 
Christians until the Copernican revolution, and was used by the Church to condemn Galileo for 
teaching the heliocentric heresy. <a href="../ec/1.html#5">1:5</a>

<p><li>"The place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again."<br>
Good description of the water cycle. <a href="../ec/1.html#7">1:7</a></li></p>

<p><li>"He hath made every thing beautiful."<br>
Everything is beautiful in its own way. Parasitic worms, cancer cells, bubonic plague. You just have to look at it from God's eyes.
<a href="../ec/3.html#11">3:11</a>

<p><li>"No man can find out the work that God maketh."<br>
Science is impossible. We can learn nothing at all about the natural world. <a href="../ec/3.html#11">3:11</a>

<p><li>"That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?"<br>
    Who can find out? We can by using science! The earth, ocean, solar system, galaxy, and universe -- nothing is too deep or far away for 
    science to discover and explore. <a href="../ec/7.html#24">7:24</a>

<p><li>"Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work
    that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet
    he shall not find it; yea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet
    shall he not be able to find it."<br>
    Oh, I think science has done a pretty good job of finding things out over the last four centuries or so. <a href="../ec/8.html#16">8:16</a>

<p><li>&quot;And&nbsp; the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den.&quot; A cockatrice 
is a serpent, hatched from a cock's egg, that can kill with a glance. They are rare nowadays.&nbsp; 
<a href="../is/11.html#8">11:8</a>

<p><li>God will gather up the people of Judea "from the four corners of the earth." In the Bible's view, the earth is flat with four
corners.  <a href="../is/11.html#12">11:12</a>

<p><li>The moon produces its own light and the earth does not move (except
when God gets angry and shakes the heavens). <a href="../is/13.html#10">13:10-13</a>

<p><li>When God gets really angry, he causes earthquakes.  <a href="../is/13.html#13">13:13</a>

<p><li>Dragons will live in Babylonian palaces and satyrs will dance there.  
<a href="../is/13.html#21">13:21-22</a>

<p><li>"Out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent." <br>
What ever happened to these fascinating biblical creatures?  <a href="../is/14.html#29">14:29</a>

<p><li>The river of Egypt (identified as the Nile in RSV) shall dry up. This has never occurred.  <a href="../is/19.html#5">19:5</a>

<p><li>God will turn the earth upside down, knock it off of its foundations, and then shake and bake it until 
it "reels to and fro like a drunkard." <a href="../is/24.html#1">24:1, 18-20</a>

<p><li> "The foundations of the earth do shake ... The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard."<br>
(Earthquakes are all a part of God's wondrous plan.) <a href="../is/24.html#18">24:18-20</a>

<p><li>God will punish the leviathan ("that crooked serpent") with his own sword and will kill the sea dragon. 
<a href="../is/27.html#1">27:1</a>

<p><li>Natural disasters (earthquakes, storms, fires, tsunamis) are caused by, and are a sign 
of, God's wrath. <a href="../is/29.html#7">29:7</a>

<p><li>Among the many strange creatures mentioned in the Bible that no longer seem to exist is the "fiery flying serpent."  
<a href="../is/30.html#6">30:6</a>

<p><li>"The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be
     sevenfold." Well, this is one prophecy that will never come true. Since the moon has no light of its own, but only 
     reflects that of the sun, it could never shine like the sun. And the sun will not, at least not while there are humans to see 
     it, shine 7 times as bright as it does now.  <a href="../is/30.html#26">30:26</a>
     
<p><li>"The LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall shew
    the lighting down of his armwith the indignation of his anger, and with
    the flame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and tempest, and hailstones."  <a href="../is/30.html#30">30:30</a>    
     
     <p><li>"The host of heaven shall be dissolved ... and ... shall fall down."<br>
The stars will dissolve and fall from the sky. <a href="../is/34.html#4">34:4</a>
     
<p><li>"And the unicorns shall come down with them."  <a href="../is/34.html#7">34:7</a>

<p><li>Dragons and satyrs may not seem real to you, but they did to the author of these verses. 
<a href="../is/34.html#13">34:13-14</a>

<p><li>God makes the sun move backwards 10 degrees. Now that's a neat trick!  <a href="../is/38.html#8">38:8</a>

<p><li> The earth is a flat disc that God looks down upon from his throne in 
heaven.  <a href="../is/40.html#22">40:22</a>

<p><li>Dragons and owls will thank God for irrigation.   <a href="../is/43.html#20">43:20</a>

<p><li>"My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure."<br>
    Unlike the god of the process theologians, the God of Isaiah  is in full control of his creation; 
    he has pre-ordained everything. <a href="../is/46.html#10">46:10-11</a>
    
<p><li>God set the earth on foundations so it doesn't move, his hand is as big as the universe, 
and the stars stand up straight when he calls them. <a href="../is/48.html#13">48:13</a>   

<p><li>God cut <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahab_%28demon%29">Rahab</a> (the sea 
monster) to pieces, wounded the dragon, and dried up the sea. <a href="../is/51.html#9">51:9-10</a>
<p><li>Bad people hatch poisonous cockatrice eggs. Whoever eats the eggs will die, and 
when the eggs are crushed a viper hatches out of them. <a href="../is/59.html#5">59:5</a>

<p><li>"Neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee." Of course the moon doesn't give off 
light, but only reflects the light from the sun.  <a href="../is/60.html#19">60:19</a>

<p><li>Immortal worms: "Their worm shall not die" <a href="../is/66.html#24">66:24</a>

are not cruel and inattentive
