<p><li>Fear your Lord. Lo! the earthquake of the Hour (of Doom)."<br>
Earquakes are sent by Allah to terrorize and kill people. <a href="index.htm#1">22:1</a> 

<p><li>"O mankind! if ye are in doubt concerning the Resurrection, then lo! We have created you from dust, 
then from a drop of seed, then from a clot, then from a little lump of flesh shapely and shapeless, that We may make (it) clear for you."<br>
Oh thanks, Allah. That clears everything up! <a href="index.htm#5">22:5</a>
