"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",
"<span class='i'>Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever.</span>--<a href='3.html#14'>Alma 3:14</a>",
"<span class='i'>I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</span>--<a href='3.html#15'>Alma 3:15</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",
"<span class='a'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges ... even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year....</span>--<a href='16.html#1'>Alma 16:1</a>",
"<span class='a'>Their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.</span>--<a href='16.html#11'>Alma 16:11</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",
"<span class='v'>He [Ammon] smote off their arms with his sword; for he did withstand their blows by smiting their arms with the edge of his sword.</span>--<a href='17.html#37'>Alma 17:37</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.   Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</span>--<a href='30.html#22'>Alma 30:22</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",
"<span class='i'>God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.</span>--<a href='30.html#47'>Alma 30:47</a>",
"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Amalekites were of a more wicked and murderous disposition than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='43.html#6'>Alma 43:6</a>",

"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",
"<span class='i'>These dissenters ... became ... more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='47.html#36'>Alma 47:36</a>",
"<span class='a'>God would prosper them in the land, or in other words ... God ... would prosper them in the land.</span>--<a href='48.html#15'>Alma 48:15</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='50.html#22'>Alma 50:22</a>",
"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",
"<span class='i'>The remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty.</span>--<a href='51.html#20'>Alma 51:20</a>",
"<span class='g'>And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye.</span>--<a href='54.html#21'>Alma 54:21</a>",
"<span class='v'>We did slay upwards of two thousand of them after they had surrendered themselves prisoners of war.</span>--<a href='57.html#14'>Alma 57:14</a>",

<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>31:1</b>   <span class="a">Now it came to pass</span> that after the end of Korihor, Alma having received tidings that the Zoramites were 
perverting the ways of the Lord, and that Zoram, who was their leader, was leading the hearts of the people to bow down 
to dumb idols, his heart again began to sicken because of the iniquity of the people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32"> <a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a> (31:1, 19, 36)
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>31:2</b>   For it was the cause of great sorrow to Alma to know of iniquity among his people; therefore his heart 
was <span class="a">exceedingly</span> sorrowful because of the separation of the Zoramites from the Nephites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">

Exceedingly (31:2, 31) 
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>31:3</b>   Now the Zoramites had gathered themselves together in a land which they called Antionum, which was east 
of the land of Zarahemla, which lay nearly bordering upon the seashore, which was south of the land of Jershon, which a
lso bordered upon the wilderness south, which wilderness was full of the Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>31:4</b>   Now the Nephites greatly feared that the Zoramites would enter into a correspondence with the 
Lamanites, and that it would be the means of great loss on the part of the Nephites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>31:5</b>   And now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was 
just -- yea, it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had 
happened unto them -- therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>31:6</b>   Therefore he took Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner; and Himni he did leave in the church in Zarahemla; 
but the former three he took with him, and also Amulek and Zeezrom, who were at Melek; and he also took two of his 
sons. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>31:7</b>   Now the eldest of his sons he took not with him, and his name was Helaman; but the names of those 
whom he took with him were Shiblon and Corianton; and these are the names of those who went with him among the Z
oramites, to preach unto them the word. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>31:8</b>   Now the Zoramites were dissenters from the Nephites; therefore they had had the word of God preached 
unto them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>31:9</b>   But they had fallen into great errors, for they would not observe to keep the 
commandments of God, and his statutes, according to the law of Moses. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>31:10</b>   Neither would they observe the performances of the church, to continue in prayer and supplication 
to God daily, that they might not enter into temptation. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>31:11</b>   Yea, in fine, <span class="plag">they did pervert the ways of the Lord</span> in very many instances; therefore, for this 
cause, Alma and his brethren went into the land to preach the word unto them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">

Wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord? -- <a href="../../acts/13.html#10">Acts 13:10</a></font>

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>31:12</b>   Now, when they had come into the land, behold, to their astonishment they found that the 
Zoramites had built synagogues, and that they did gather themselves together on one day of the week, which 
day they did call the day of the Lord; and they did worship after a manner which Alma and his brethren had 
never beheld; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>31:13</b>   For they had a place built up in the center of their synagogue, a place for standing, which was 
high above the head, and the top thereof would only admit one person. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>31:14</b>   Therefore, whosoever desired to worship must go forth and stand upon the top thereof, and stretch 
forth his hands towards heaven, and cry with a loud voice, saying: <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>31:15</b>   Holy, holy God; we believe that thou art God, and we believe that thou art holy, and that thou wast 
a spirit, and that thou art a spirit, and that thou wilt be a spirit forever. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>31:16</b>   Holy God, we believe that thou hast separated us from our brethren; and 
<span class="g">we do not believe in the 
tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers</span>; but we believe that 
thou hast elected us to be thy holy children; and also thou hast made it known unto us that there shall be no 
Christ. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/good1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1">The Zoramites rightly reject the childish traditions of their fathers.</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>31:17</b>   But thou art <span class="plag">the same yesterday, today, and forever</span>; and thou hast elected us that we shall be 
saved, whilst all around us are elected to be cast by thy wrath down to hell; for the which holiness, O God, we 
thank thee; and we also thank thee that thou hast elected us, that we may not be led away after the foolish 
traditions of our brethren, which doth bind them down to a belief of Christ, which doth lead their hearts to 
wander far from thee, our God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>31:18</b>   And again we thank thee, O God, that we are a chosen and a holy people.  Amen. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>31:19</b>   <span class="a">Now it came to pass</span> that after Alma and his brethren and his sons had heard these prayers, they 
were astonished beyond all measure. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>31:20</b>   For behold, every man did go forth and offer up these same prayers. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>31:21</b>   Now the place was called by them Rameumptom, which, being interpreted, is the holy stand. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>31:22</b>   Now, from this stand they did offer up, every man, the selfsame prayer unto God, thanking their 
God that they were chosen of him, and that he did not lead them away after the tradition of their brethren, and 
that their hearts were not stolen away to believe in things to come, which they knew nothing about. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>31:23</b>   Now, after the people had all offered up thanks after this manner, they returned to their homes, 
never speaking of their God again until they had assembled themselves together again to the holy stand, to offer 
up thanks after their manner. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>31:24</b>   Now when Alma saw this his heart was grieved; for he saw that they were a wicked and a perverse 
people; yea, he saw that their hearts were set upon gold, and upon silver, and upon all manner of fine goods. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>31:25</b>   Yea, and he also saw that their hearts were lifted up unto great boasting, in their pride. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>31:26</b>   And he lifted up his voice to heaven, and cried, saying: O, how long, O Lord, wilt thou suffer that 
thy servants shall dwell here below in the flesh, to behold such gross wickedness among the children of men? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>31:27</b>   Behold, O God, they cry unto thee, and yet their hearts are swallowed up in their pride.  Behold, 
O God, they cry unto thee with their mouths, while they are puffed up, even to greatness, with the vain things of 
the world. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>31:28</b>   Behold, O my God, their costly apparel, and their ringlets, and their bracelets, 
and their ornaments of gold, and all their precious things which they are ornamented with; and behold, their hearts 
are set upon them, and yet they cry unto thee and say -- We thank thee, O God, for we are a chosen people unto 
thee, while others shall perish. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>31:29</b>   Yea, and they say that thou hast made it known unto them that there shall be no Christ. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>31:30</b>   O Lord God, how long wilt thou suffer that such wickedness and infidelity shall be among this 
people?  O Lord, wilt thou give me strength, that I may bear with mine infirmities.  For I am infirm, and such 
wickedness among this people doth pain my soul. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>31:31</b>   O Lord, my heart is <span class="a">exceedingly</span> sorrowful; wilt thou comfort my soul in 
Christ.  O Lord, wilt thou grant unto me that I may have strength, that I may suffer with patience these 
afflictions which shall come upon me, because of the iniquity of this people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="32"></a>31:32</b>   O Lord, wilt thou comfort my soul, and give unto me success, and also my fellow laborers who are 
with me -- yea, Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and also Amulek and Zeezrom and also my two sons -- yea, even all these 
wilt thou comfort, O Lord.  Yea, wilt thou comfort their souls in Christ. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="33"></a>31:33</b>   Wilt thou grant unto them that they may have strength, that they may bear their afflictions which 
shall come upon them because of the iniquities of this people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="34"></a>31:34</b>   O Lord, wilt thou grant unto us that we may have success in bringing them again unto thee in 
Christ. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="35"></a>31:35</b>   Behold, O Lord, their souls are precious, and many of them are our brethren; therefore, give 
unto us, O Lord, power and wisdom that we may bring these, our brethren, again unto thee. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="36"></a>31:36</b>   <span class="a">Now it came to pass</span> that when Alma had said these words, that he clapped his hands upon all them 
who were with him.  And behold, as he clapped his hands upon them, they were filled with the Holy Spirit. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="37"></a>31:37</b>   And after that they did separate themselves one from another, <span class="plag">taking no thought for themselves 
what they should eat, or what they should drink, or what they should put on.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/plag.gif" border="0" width="32" height="32">
Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on.

<tr><td><b><a name="38"></a>31:38</b>   And the Lord provided for them that they should hunger not, neither should they thirst; yea, and 
he also gave them strength, that they should suffer no manner of afflictions, save it were swallowed up in the joy 
of Christ.  Now this was according to the prayer of Alma; and this because he prayed in faith. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
