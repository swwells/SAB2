and my brethren, 
<span class="a">behold</span> I say unto you, how great reason have we to rejoice; for could we have supposed when we started from the land of 
Zarahemla that God would have granted unto us such great blessings? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32">Joseph Smith used "behold" 26 times in this chapter of 37 verses. 
(The most it's ever used in the King James Version is 21 
times in the 59 verses of <a href="../../lev/13.html">Leviticus 13</a>.)

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>26:2</b>   And now, I ask, what great blessings has he bestowed upon us?   Can ye tell? 
<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>26:3</b>   <span class="a">Behold</span>, I answer for you; for our brethren, the Lamanites, were in darkness, yea, even in the darkest 
abyss, but <span class="a">behold</span>, how many of them are brought to <span class="a">behold</span> the marvelous light of God!   And this is the blessing which 
hath been bestowed upon us, that we have been made instruments in the hands of God to bring about this great work. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>26:4</b>   <span class="a">Behold</span>, thousands of them do rejoice, and have been brought into the fold of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>26:5</b>   <span class="a">Behold</span>, the field was ripe, and blessed are ye, for ye did 
<span class="plag">thrust in the sickle, and did reap</span> with your 
might, yea, all the day long did ye labor; and <span class="a">behold</span> the number of your sheaves!   And they shall be gathered into the 
garners, that they are not wasted. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

by the whirlwinds; but when the storm cometh they shall be gathered together in their place, that the storm cannot 
penetrate to them; yea, neither shall they be driven with fierce winds whithersoever the enemy listeth to carry them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>26:7</b>   But <span class="a">behold</span>, they are in the hands of the Lord of the

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>26:8</b>   Blessed be the name of our God; let us sing to his praise, yea, let us give thanks to his holy name, 
for he doth work righteousness forever. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>26:9</b>   For if we had not come up out of the land of Zarahemla, these our dearly beloved brethren, who have so 
dearly beloved us, would still have been racked with hatred against us, yea, and they would also have been strangers to 
God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>26:10</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when Ammon had said these words, his brother Aaron 
rebuked him, saying: Ammon, I fear that thy joy doth carry thee away unto boasting. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a>
</font> 

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>26:11</b>   But Ammon said unto him: I do not boast in my own strength, nor in my own wisdom; but 
<span class="a">behold</span>, my joy 
is full, yea, my heart is brim with joy, and I will rejoice in my God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>26:12</b>   Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself, but 
I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things; yea, <span class="a">behold</span>, many mighty miracles we have wrought in 
this land, for which we will praise his name forever. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>26:13</b>   <span class="a">Behold</span>, how many thousands of our brethren has he loosed from the pains of hell; and they are brought 
to sing redeeming love, and this because of the power of his word which is in us, therefore have we not great reason to 
rejoice? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>26:14</b>   Yea, we have reason to praise him forever, for he is the Most High God, and has loosed our brethren 
from the chains of hell. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>26:15</b>   Yea, they were encircled about with everlasting darkness and destruction; but 
<span class="a">behold</span>, he has brought 
them into his everlasting light, yea, into everlasting salvation; and they are encircled about with the matchless bounty 
of his love; yea, and we have been instruments in his hands of doing this great and marvelous work. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>26:16</b>   Therefore, let us glory, yea, we will glory in the Lord; yea, we will rejoice, for our joy is full; yea, 
we will praise our God forever.  <span class="a">Behold</span>, who can glory too much in the Lord?  Yea, who can say too much of his great 
power, and of his mercy, and of his long-suffering towards the children of men?  <span class="a">Behold</span>, I say unto you, I cannot say 
the smallest part which I feel. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>26:17</b>   Who could have supposed that our God would have been so merciful as to have snatched us from our 
awful, sinful, and polluted state? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>26:18</b>   <span class="a">Behold</span>, we went forth even in wrath, with mighty threatenings to destroy his church. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>26:19</b>   Oh then, why did he not consign us to an awful destruction, yea, why did he not let the sword of his 
justice fall upon us, and doom us to eternal despair? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>26:20</b>   Oh, my soul, almost as it were, fleeth at the thought.   <span class="a">Behold</span>, he did not exercise his justice 
upon us, but in his great mercy hath brought us over that everlasting gulf of death and misery, even to the salvation 
of our souls. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>26:21</b>   And now <span class="a">behold</span>, my brethren, what natural man is there that knoweth these things?  
I say unto you, there is none that knoweth these things, save it be the penitent. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>26:22</b>   Yea, he that repenteth and exerciseth faith, and bringeth forth good works, and prayeth continually 
without ceasing -- unto such it is given to know the mysteries of God; yea, unto such it shall be given to reveal things 
which never have been revealed; yea, and it shall be given unto such to bring thousands of souls to repentance, even as 
it has been given unto us to bring these our brethren to repentance. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>26:23</b>   Now do ye remember, my brethren, that we said unto our brethren in the land of Zarahemla, we go up to 
the land of Nephi, to preach unto our brethren, the Lamanites, and they laughed us to scorn? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>26:24</b>   For they said unto us: Do ye suppose that ye can bring the Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth? 
 Do ye suppose that ye can convince <span class="i">the Lamanites</span> of the incorrectness of the traditions of their fathers, as 
 stiffnecked a people as they are; <span class="i">whose hearts delight in the shedding of blood; whose days have been spent in 
 the grossest iniquity</span>; whose ways have been the ways of a transgressor from the beginning?  Now my brethren, ye 
 remember that this was their language. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/int.gif" width="32" height="32">
<img src="../../images/inj1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1">The Lamanites (Native Americans) "delight in the shedding of blood" and spend their days in 
"the grossest iniquity."</font>
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>26:25</b>   And moreover they did say: Let us take up arms against them, that we destroy them and their iniquity 
 out of the land, lest they overrun us and destroy us. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>26:26</b>   But <span class="a">behold</span>, my beloved brethren, we came into the wilderness not with the intent to destroy our 
 brethren, but with the intent that perhaps we might save some few of their souls. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>26:27</b>   Now when our hearts were depressed, and we were about to turn back, 
 <span class="a">behold</span>, the Lord comforted us, 
 and said: Go amongst thy brethren, the Lamanites, and bear with patience thine afflictions, and I will give unto you 
 success. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>26:28</b>   And now <span class="a">behold</span>, we have come, and been forth amongst them; 
and we have been patient in our sufferings, and we have suffered every privation; yea, we have traveled from house to 
house, relying upon the mercies of the world -- not upon the mercies of the world alone but upon the mercies of God. 

<td bgcolor="eeeeee"><tr><td><b><a name="29">26:29</b>   And we have entered into their houses and taught them, and we have taught them in their streets; 
yea, and we have taught them upon their hills; and we have also entered into their temples and their synagogues and 
taught them; and we have been cast out, and mocked, and spit upon, and smote upon our cheeks; and we have been stoned, 
and taken and bound with strong cords, and cast into prison; and through the power and wisdom of God we have been 
delivered again. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>26:30</b>   And we have suffered all manner of afflictions, and all this, that perhaps we might be the means of 
saving some soul; and we supposed that our joy would be full if perhaps we could be the means of saving some. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>26:31</b>   Now <span class="a">behold</span>, we can look forth and see the fruits of our labors; and are they 
few?  I say unto you, Nay, they are many; yea, and we can witness of their sincerity, because of their love towards 
their brethren and also towards us. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="32"></a>26:32</b>   For <span class="a">behold</span>, they had rather sacrifice their lives than even to take the life of their enemy; and they 
have buried their weapons of war deep in the earth, because of their love towards their brethren. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="33"></a>26:33</b>   And now <span class="a">behold</span> I say unto you, has there been so great love in all the land?  
<span class="a">Behold</span>, I say unto you, 
Nay, there has not, even among the Nephites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="34"></a>26:34</b>   For <span class="a">behold</span>, they would take up arms against their brethren; they would not suffer themselves to be 
slain.  But <span class="a">behold</span> how many of these have laid down their lives; and we know that they have gone to their God, because 
of their love and of their hatred to sin. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="35"></a>26:35</b>   Now have we not reason to rejoice?  Yea, I say unto you, there never were men that had so great 
reason to rejoice as we, since the world began; yea, and my joy is carried away, even unto boasting in my God; for 
he has all power, all wisdom, and all understanding; he comprehendeth all things, and he is a merciful Being, even 
unto salvation, to those who will repent and believe on his name. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="36"></a>26:36</b>   Now if this is boasting, even so will I boast; for this is my life and my light, my joy and my 
salvation, and my redemption from everlasting wo.  Yea, blessed is the name of my God, who has been mindful of this 
people, who are a branch of the tree of Israel, and has been lost from its body in a strange land; yea, I say, blessed 
be the name of my God, who has been mindful of us, wanderers in a strange land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="37"></a>26:37</b>   Now my brethren, we see that God is mindful of every people, whatsoever land they may be in; yea, 
he numbereth his people, and his bowels of mercy are over all the earth.  Now this is my joy, and my great 
thanksgiving; yea, and I will give thanks unto my God forever.  Amen. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
