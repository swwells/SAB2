slaughtered them as they ran, taking all their stuff and giving it to Judith -- the forever blessed,  glory of Jerusalem and joy of Israel. 
(God gave Judith the strength to behead a sleeping man to reward her for not having sex after her husband died.)

<p>(15:1-2) <i>"When all the army heard that Holofernes was beheaded, courage and counsel fled from them, 
and being seized with trembling and fear they thought only to save themselves by flight ... and fled by the ways 
of the fields, and the paths of the hills."</i>
