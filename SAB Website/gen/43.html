  If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto
    us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man

  And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred,
    saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him
    according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would
    say, Bring your brother down?<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="8">43:8</A></B>
  And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will

    little ones.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this;
    take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man
    a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and
    almonds:<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

    upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for

    might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the
    Egyptians.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
