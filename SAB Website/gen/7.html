  <img src="../images/contra1.gif" >
  <img src="../images/abs1.gif" > (7:1) <b><i>"Thee have I seen righteous."</i></b><br>
 God calls Noah "righteous." But this contradicts several other verses that say there never has been such a person. And he just doesn't 
  seem too darned righteous in <a href="../gen/9.html#20">9:20-21</a>. (Where he gets drunk and lies 
  around naked in front of God and everybody.)<br>
  <a href="../contra/righteous.html" >Has there ever been a righteous person?</a>
  
  <p><img src="../images/contra1.gif" >
  <img src="../images/abs1.gif" >(7:2-3) <br>
  <i>"Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens."</i><br>
  How did Noah know which animals were "clean" and "unclean" to God? (It wasn't defined until Leviticus was written.)<br>
<a href="../contra/twos.html">How many of each kind did Noah take into the ark?</a>

<p>  <img src="../images/cr1.gif"> 
  <img src="../images/inj1.gif"> (7:4) <b><i>"Every  living substance that I have made will I destroy."</i></b><br>
God repeats his intention to kill "every living substance ... from off the face of the earth." But why 
does God kill all the innocent animals? What had they done to deserve his wrath? It seems God never gets his fill of 
tormenting animals.

<p><img src="../images/contra1.gif" >
(7:7-10, 11-13) <i>"In the selfsame day entered Noah."</i><br>
 <a href="../contra/Noah_enter.html">When did Noah enter the ark?</a>
 
 <p><img src="../images/sci1.gif" >
  <img src="../images/abs1.gif" >
 <img src="../images/contra1.gif" > (7:8-9) Whether by twos or by sevens, Noah takes representatives from each species of "every thing that creepeth upon the earth." 
Now this must have taken some time, along with expert knowledge of taxonomy, genetics, biogeography, and anatomy. How did Noah 
manage to collect the endemic species from the New World, Australia, Polynesia, and other remote regions entirely unknown to him? 
How, once he found them, did he transport them back to the ark? How could he tell the male and female beetles (there are more than 500,000 species)
 apart? How did he know how to care for these new and unfamiliar animals? How did he find the space on the ark? How did he manage to 
 find and care for the hundreds of thousands of parasitic species? How did he obtain and care for the hundreds of thousands of species of plants? 
(Plants are ignored in the Genesis account, but the animals wouldn't last long after if the plants died in the flood.) No, wait, don't tell me. 
A miracle happened. Millions of them.
<a href="../contra/twos.html">How many of each kind did Noah take into the ark?</a>

<p>(7:8) <i>"Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, 

<p>(7:9) <i>"There went in two and two."</i>

  <p><img src="../images/sci1.gif"> 
  <img src="../images/abs1.gif">(7:11) <i>"The windows of heaven were opened."</i><br>
God opens the "windows of heaven."He does this every time it rains.

<p><i>"In the six hundreth year of Noah's life ... the windows of heaven were opened."</i><br>
(See <a href="../quran/29/index.htm#14">Quran 29:14</a> which says he was 950 when the flood began.)

<p><p><img src="../images/sci1.gif"> 
  <img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (7:13-14)  <i>"In the selfsame day"</i><br>
All of the animals boarded the ark "in
the selfsame day." <br>
With a million or so species (There are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia_of_Life">more than a million known today</a>.),  
the animals must have boarded at a rate of at least 10 pairs/second. 

<p><img src="../images/contra1.gif" > (7:15) <i>"And they went ... into the ark, two and two of all flesh, 
wherein there is breath of life."</i><br> 
<a href="../contra/twos.html">How many of each kind did Noah take into the ark?</a>

<p><img src="../images/contra1.gif" > (7:17)<i>"And the flood was forty days upon the earth."</i><br>
 <a href="../contra/flood.html">How long did the flood last?</a>
 
 <p><img src="../images/sci1.gif"> (7:19-20) <i>"The mountains were covered."</i><br>
The flood covered the highest mountain tops (Mount Everest?) with fifteen cubits to spare. Where did all the water come
from? Where did it all go? Why is there no evidence of such a massive flood in the geological record?

<p><img src="../images/cr1.gif">
