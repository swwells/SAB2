heal them, for I have compassion upon you; <span class="a">my bowels are filled with mercy.

<tr><td><b>17:8<a name="8"></a></b>   For I perceive that ye desire that I should show unto you what I have done unto your brethren at Jerusalem, for I 
see that your faith is sufficient that I should heal you. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>17:9<a name="9"></a></b>   <span class="a">It came to pass</span> that when he had thus spoken, all the multitude, with one accord, did 
go forth with their sick and their afflicted, and their lame, and with their blind, and with their dumb, and with all them 
that were afflicted in any manner; and he did heal them every one as they were brought forth unto him. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>17:10<a name="10"></a></b>   And they did all, both they who had been healed and they who were whole, bow down at his feet, and did worship 
him; and as many as could come for the multitude did kiss his feet, insomuch that they did bathe his feet with their tears. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>17:11<a name="11"></a></b>   <span class="a">It came to pass</span> that he commanded that their little children should be brought. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

and said: Father, I am troubled because of the wickedness of the people of the house of Israel. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>17:15<a name="15"></a></b>   And when he had said these words, he himself also knelt upon the earth; and behold he prayed unto the Father, 
and the things which he prayed cannot be written, and the multitude did bear record who heard him. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>17:16<a name="16"></a></b>   And after this manner do they bear record: The eye hath never seen, neither hath the ear heard, before, so great

<tr><td><b>17:17<a name="17"></a></b>   And no tongue can speak, neither can there be written by any man, neither can the hearts of men conceive so 
great and marvelous things as we both saw and heard Jesus speak; and no one can conceive of the joy which filled our souls at 
the time we heard him pray for us unto the Father. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>17:18<a name="18"></a></b>   <span class="a">It came to pass</span> that when Jesus had made an end of praying unto the Father, he arose; but 
so great was the joy of the multitude that they were overcome. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>17:19<a name="19"></a></b>   <span class="a">It came to pass</span> that Jesus spake unto them, and bade them arise. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

my joy is full. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>17:21<a name="21"></a></b>   And when he had said these words, he wept, and the multitude bare record of it, and he took their little 
children, one by one, and blessed them, and prayed unto the Father for them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>17:22<a name="22"></a></b>   And when he had done this he wept again; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>17:23<a name="23"></a></b>   And he spake unto the multitude, and said unto them: Behold your little ones. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>17:24<a name="24"></a></b>   And as they looked to behold they cast their eyes towards heaven, and they saw the heavens open, and they saw 
angels descending out of heaven as it were in the midst of fire; and they came down and encircled those little ones about, and 
were encircled about with fire; and the angels did minister unto them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>17:25<a name="25"></a></b>   And the multitude did see and hear and bear record; and they know that their record is true for they all of them 
did see and hear, every man for himself; and they were in number about two thousand and five hundred souls; and they did consist 
of men, women, and children. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
