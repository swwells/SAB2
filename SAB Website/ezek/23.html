 (23:1-49)<br>
Two sisters were guilty of "committing whoredoms" by pressing their breasts and bruising "the teats of their
virginity." As a punishment, one sister's nakedness was discovered, her
children were taken from her, and she was killed by the sword. But the fate of
the surviving sister was even worse. Her nose and ears were cut off, she was
made to "pluck off" her own breasts, and then after being raped and
mutilated, she is stoned to death.
