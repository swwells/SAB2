<p><li>Blessed are the merciful." <a href="5.html#7">5:7</a>

<p><li>"Blessed are the peacemakers." <a href="5.html#9">5:9</a>

<p><li>"Love your enemies." Well, it's a nice thought. But it seems strange coming from someone who damns 
his enemies to hell. (<A href="../mk/16.html#16">Mark 16:16</A>) <a href="5.html#44">5:44</a>

<p><li>Don't brag about the good things that you do. <a href="6.html#1">6:1-3</a>

<p><li>Jesus tells his disciples not to pray in public. Those who favor school prayer, National Day of Prayer, etc. should
take his advice. <a href="6.html#5">6:5-6</a>

<p><li>"Consider the lilies of the field...." A nice analogy, good advice (unless you live in cold climates), and a 
great movie. <a href="6.html#28">6:28</a>

<p><li>"Judge not, that ye be not judged." <a href="7.html#1">7:1</a>

<p><li>Avoid hypocrisy. Consider your own faults rather than criticizing others. <a href="7.html#3">7:3-4</a>

<p><li>"Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." <a href="7.html#12">7:12</a>

<p><li>Forgive those who repeatedly offend you. <a href="18.html#21">18:21-22</a>

<p><li>Jesus lists the "ten commandments," but his list has only six, and the sixth is not one of the ten. The
commandments given by Jesus are secular, not religious, in nature.  <a href="19.html#18">19:18</a>

<p><LI>Pay your taxes. Keep state and church separate. <a href="22.html#17">22:17-21</a>

<p><li>Jesus quotes <A href="../lev/19.html#18&quot;">Lev 19:18</A>: &quot;Love thy neighbor as 
thyself.&quot; This is by far the best verse in Leviticus, and one of the best in the entire Bible.

 <p><li>"For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me
    drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in." <a href="25.html#35">25:35</a>
