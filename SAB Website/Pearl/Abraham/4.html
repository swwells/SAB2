<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/plag.gif">(4:1) <i>"Let us go down."</i> (<a href="../../gen/11.html#7">Genesis 11:7</a>)<br>
The phrase "Let us go down" is used in the Bible in <a href="../../gen/11.html#7">Genesis 11:7</a>, where God (or the gods) go down to 
see what's happening in Babel. The rest of the chapter is taken from the first Genesis creation story (<a href="../../gen/1.html#1">Genesis 1:1-2:3</a>), 
changing the wording slightly to make it explicitly polytheistic and adding some 
"<a href="../../bom/topics/aictp.html">and it came to pass</a>es" here and there. (Joseph Smith's beloved phrase is not found in Genesis 1.)

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(4:1)  At the beginning, and they, that is the Gods, organized and formed the heavens and the earth. 
(<a href="../../gen/1.html#1">Genesis 1:1</a>)

<p><img src="../../images/interp.gif">(4:1-31) <br><i>"And they, that is the Gods, organized and formed the heavens and the earth."</i><br>
Although <a href="../../contra/gods.html">the Bible is ambiguous on the subject</a>, the Book of Abraham makes it very clear: there are many 
gods. Mormonism is a polytheistic faith.

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(4:2) Darkness reigned upon the face of the deep, and the Spirit of the Gods was brooding upon the face 
of the waters. (<a href="../../gen/1.html#2">Genesis 1:2</a>)

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(4:3)<br> Let there be light; and there was light. (<a href="../../gen/1.html#3">Genesis 1:3</a>)

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(4:4) They divided the light, or caused it to be divided, from the darkness.  
(<a href="../../gen/1.html#4">Genesis 1:4</a>)

<a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a>

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(4:5) And the Gods called the light Day, and the darkness they called Night.
(<a href="../../gen/1.html#5">Genesis 1:5</a>)

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(4:6) Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and it shall divide the waters from the waters.
(<a href="../../gen/1.html#6">Genesis 1:6</a>)

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(4:7) And the Gods ordered the expanse, so that it divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse
(<a href="../../gen/1.html#7">Genesis 1:7</a>)

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(4:8) And the Gods called the expanse, Heaven.
(<a href="../../gen/1.html#8">Genesis 1:8</a>)

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(4:9) Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place
(<a href="../../gen/1.html#9">Genesis 1:9</a>)

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(4:10) And the Gods pronounced the dry land, Earth; and the gathering together of the waters, pronounced 
they, Great Waters (<a href="../../gen/1.html#10">Genesis 1:10</a>)

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(4:11) And the Gods said: Let us prepare the earth to bring forth grass 
(<a href="../../gen/1.html#11">Genesis 1:11</a>)

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(4:12) And the Gods organized the earth to bring forth grass
(<a href="../../gen/1.html#12">Genesis 1:12</a>)

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(4:13) Morning until the evening they called day; and it was the third time
(<a href="../../gen/1.html#13">Genesis 1:13</a>)

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(4:14) And the Gods organized the lights in the expanse of the heaven, and caused them to divide the day 
from the night; and organized them to be for signs and for seasons, and for days and for years (<a href="../../gen/1.html#14">Genesis 1:14</a>)

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(4:15) Lights in the expanse of the heaven to give light upon the earth 
(<a href="../../gen/1.html#15">Genesis 1:15</a>)

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(4:16) And the Gods organized the two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; with the lesser light 
they set the stars also (<a href="../../gen/1.html#16">Genesis 1:16</a>)

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(4:17) And the Gods set them in the expanse of the heavens, to give light upon the earth 
(<a href="../../gen/1.html#17">Genesis 1:17</a>)

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(4:19) It was from morning until evening that it was day; and it was the fourth time. 
(<a href="../../gen/1.html#19">Genesis 1:19</a>)

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(4:20) Let us prepare the waters to bring forth abundantly (<a href="../../gen/1.html#20">Genesis 1:20</a>)

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(4:21) And the Gods prepared the waters that they might bring forth great whales
(<a href="../../gen/1.html#21">Genesis 1:21</a>)

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif">(4:22) We will bless them, and cause them to be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas or 
great waters
(<a href="../../gen/1.html#22">Genesis 1:22</a>)

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif"> (4:23) It was from morning until evening that they called day; and it was the fifth time.
