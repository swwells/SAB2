<p><li>"And God made the beast of the earth." <br>
The Christian Identity and Aryan Nations folks say that "beast of the earth" and "beast of the 
field" refer to all non-human animals and non-white humans. They consider all people of color to be 
without a soul and on the same level as animals, such as cattle, fish, and birds. <a href="../gen/1.html#25">1:25</a>
 
<p><li>God gave humans dominion over every other living thing on earth. 
This couldn't be true, of course, since millions of other species existed for 
millions of years before humans existed. But this verse is used by 
fundamentalist Christians to justify their mistreatment of other species and 
disregard for the environment. After all, they believe that God created the 
other species just for them, so they can do whatever they please with them.  <a href="../gen/1.html#26">1:26</a>

<p><li>One way of dealing with <a href="../contra/accounts.html">the two contradictory creation 
accounts</a> is to say that the reason there are two different stories is that there were two different 
creations. This has been a common interpretation historically, and it is still found taday.

<p><li>"Be fruitful and multiply." <br>

<p><li>In Christian Identity theology, the serpent is a black male ("beast of the field"), possessed 
by the devil, who seduced Eve. Cain is the child that is born from this union, the evil son of 
the devil and the first Jew. All Jews are descended from Cain. <a href="../gen/3.html#1">3:1</a>

<a href="../interp/mark_of_cain.html">The mark of Cain and Racism</a> <a href="../gen/4.html#15">4:15</a>

<p><li>"And Cain knew his wife." That's
nice, but where the hell did she come from? 

<p>Although the Bible doesn't say, Joseph Smith provided the answer 
in "<a href="http://www.centerplace.org/hs/iv/iv-gen.htm">The Inspired 
Version</a>" of the Bible, which was his very own "translation". Here's what it says:

<blockquote>
And it came to pass, that Cain took one of his brother's daughters to wife, and they loved Satan more than 
God. – Gen.5:13</blockquote>

<p>So according to Joseph Smith (and he ought to know!) Cain married one
of his nieces. He doesn't say, though, which of Cain's brothers was Mrs. Cain's father.

<p>Another answer is provided by the <a href="../interp/preadamites.html">Pre-Adamite</a> theory.

<p><li><a href="../interp/sons_of_god.html">Who were the sons of God?</a> <a href="../gen/6.html#2">6:2</a>

<p><li>The flood story in Genesis is confusing to read. The clean animals go into the ark by twos (<a href="../gen/6.html#19">6:19-20</a>, 
<a href="../gen/7.html#8">7:8-9</a>) 
and by sevens (<a href="../gen/7.html#2">7:2</a>). The flood lasts for forty days (<a href="../gen/7.html#17">7:17</a>)  
and for 150 days (<a href="../gen/7.html#24">7:24</a>, <a href="../gen/8.html#3">8:3</a>). Noah sends out a raven 
(<a href="../gen/8.html#7">8:7</a>) and a dove (<a href="../gen/8.html#8">8:8</a>). <br>
Why doesn't Genesis get its story straight? Because there were two separate accounts that were (somewhat clumsily) 
interwoven. <a href="../gen/8.html#7">8:7</a>

<p><li>"But ... the blood thereof, shall ye not eat." <br>
<a href="../interp/blood.html">Blood Transfusions</a> <a href="../gen/9.html#4">9:4</a>

<p><li>"And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger 
son had done unto him."<br>
What did Ham do? Did he just look at his naked father or was there something more to it than that? 
  Some commentators have suggested that Ham committed homosexual rape on his drunken father, and that 
  this was why Ham's descendants were eternally punished with slavery. <a href="../gen/9.html#24">9:24</a>

Who was Nimrod? The king who tried to construct the tower of Babel? The first pope? Elmer Fudd? Here are some links to help you decide. 
<a href="../gen/10.html#8">10:8-10</a>

<p><li>"Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided." <br>
Some creationists believe that this verse refers to continental drift, which, they say,
began to occur during the days of Pelag (which means "division"), about 100 or so years after the flood. But many 
other creationists <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/peleg.html">disagree</a>. <a href="../gen/10.html#25">10:25</a>

<p><li>"Terah ... begat Abraham."<br>
Who was Abraham's father? Azar or Terah (<a href="../quran/6/index.htm#74">Quran 6:74</a>)? Which is right, the Bible or 
the Quran? <a href="../gen/11.html#26">11:26</a>

<p><li>Say, I pray thee, thouart my sister."<br>
In the LDS <a href="../pearl/abraham/2.html#">Book of Abraham</a> the same silly story is told, but it is God, not Abraham, who concocts the lie.

Harlot by the Side of the Road</a> that the "play" between Isaac and Ishmael may have been of a 
sexual nature, noting that the same word is used to describe the behaviour of 
Ishmael and Isaac as is used in <a href="../gen/26.html#8">26:8</a> to describe Isaac's fondling of Rebekah.  <a href="../gen/21.html#9">21:9</a>

<a href="../gen/27.html#28">27:28</a>

<p><li>According to the Apocryphal/Deuterocanonical book of Judith, God not only approved of the violence 
in Genesis 34, but he gave Simeon the sword that he used to kill all the males in the city.

<p><li>"Lucifer, son of the morning."<br>
This is the only verse in the bible that mentions Lucifer. Although 
most Christians consider Lucifer to be Satan (the devil), there is little biblical justification for 
doing so. In this verse "Lucifer" refers to the king of Babylon (Nebuchadrezzar?) and Lucifer 
(the light bearer) is also called the "son of the morning" or morning star. The only other person that 
is referred to in that way is Jesus (<a href="../rev/22.html#16">Rev 22:16</a>). Does this mean that Lucifer 
is Jesus? <a href="../is/14.html#12">14:12</a>

<p><li>"Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus"<br>
    "Anointed one" means Messiah. So was king Cyrus the Messiah?<br>
    David Koresh (born Vernon Howell) chose his name after the two men in the 
	Bible who are called Messiah (or anointed 
    one) in the Bible: David and Cyrus. (The name "Koresh" is a

<p><li>"They ... parted my land." <a href="../jl/3.html#2">3:2</a><br>
On January 5, 2006, Pat Robertson linked Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's stroke to God's wrath, saying:
"In the book of Joel, the prophet Joel makes it very clear that God has 'enmity against those who divide my land.'"<br>
Although he didn't quote chapter and verse, Joel 3:2 is probably what he was referring to, though his interpretation of that 
verse is a bit less than "very clear" to me.

(along with <a href="../dt/19.html#15">Dt 19:15</a> and <a href="../1tim/5.html#19">1 Tim 5:19</a>) 
to justify their refusal to report or investigate incidents of child molestation unless two or three

<p><li>The parable of the unfair, lying employer<br>
The kingdom of heaven is like a business that hires workers, paying each the same wage (one penny). Some work 12 hours for the penny; 
others 9, 6, or 3 hours; and others for only one hour. If one of the 12-hour workers complains about it, his boss says, 
"Hey, didn't you agree to work all day for a penny? What are you complaining about? From this parable, David Barton (and the Republicans) 
claim that Jesus was against the minimum wage.<br>
But the employer didn't say he'd pay each of the workers a penny; he said he'd pay them "whatsoever is right" (vv.4,7). 
Is it right for one employee to be paid twelve times as much as another when both are doing the same type of work? <a href="../mt/20.html#1">20:1-15</a>

<p><LI>Pay your taxes. Keep state and church separate. <a href="../mt/22.html#17">22:17-21</a>

<p><li>The end of the world will be signaled by wars, famines, disease, and earthquakes (6-7). And that's just 
    "the beginning of sorrows" (8). Next believers will be hated and killed by unbelievers (9), believers will hate and betray each other (10), false 
    prophets will fool people (11), iniquity will abound and love wax cold (12). But hey, if you make through all that, you'll be saved (13).  
    
    <p>Only one more thing will happen before the end comes: the gospel will be preached throughout the world (14). Well, that and the abomination 
    of desolations will stand in the holy place (15), many false Christs and false prophets will show great signs and wonders (24), the sun and moon 
    will be darkened and the stars will fall (29), the sign of the son of Man will appear in the sky, everyone on earth will mourn, and then, 
    finally, the great and powerful son of Man will come in all his glory (30).
    
    <p>Oh, and all these things will happen within the lifespan of Jesus' contemporaries (34).
    
    <p>Or maybe not. Jesus was talking about things he knew nothing about (36). (See <a href="../mk/13.html#32">Mark 13:32</a>.)
  <a href="../mt/24.html#3">24:3-51</a>

<p><li>"They shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory." <br>
<a href="../contra/seejesus.html">Will Jesus' second coming be visible to all?</a> Well, not according to the Jehovah's 
Witnesses, anyway. Even though in this verse Jesus says he'll return "on the clouds of heaven with great power 
 and glory" and <a href="../rev/1.html#7">Rev 1:7</a> says that "every eye shall see him," The 
 Governing Body claims that Jesus returned invisibly in 1914 without clouds, glory, or being seen by 
anyone. <a href="../mt/24.html#30">24:30</a>

<p><li>"Learn a parable of the fig tree." <br>
Based on these versese, Hal Linsey's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/031027771X/skepticsannotate">The Late, 
    Great Planet Earth</a> predicted that the end of the world would occur before 1988. The fig tree represents 
    Israel, Israel came back to life in 1948, and Jesus said the end would come within one generation (40 years). 
    <a href="../mt/24.html#32">24:32-34</a>

<p><li>"Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled." <br>
The Jehovah's Witnesses used to interpret this verse to mean that some of those who witnessed 
Jesus' return in 1914 would still be alive when Armageddon happened. Now that those alive in 1914 are now pretty much dead, the 
JWs have given up on this prediction. <a href="../mt/24.html#34">24:34</a> 

<p><li>Jesus was a false prophet, since he predicted that the end of the world will come within the lifetimes of his disciples. <A
href="../contra/earth.html" title="With the earth last forever?">The world didn't end</A> then, and
according to <A href="../ec/1.html#4">Ec 1:4</A> it never will. <a href="../mt/24.html#34">24:34</a>
 
 <p><li>"Not the angels of heaven, but my Father only"  <br> 
 The best and earliest Greek manuscripts say, "not the angels of heaven, <i>neither the son</i>, but the Father only." But apparently 
 it bothered the scribes that there were some things Jesus didn't know, so they fixed it by omitting the phrase, "neither the son." 
 <a href="../mt/24.html#26">24:36</a>

<p><li>"Who then is a faithful and wise servant?" <br> For JWs, 
this is the most important verse in the Bible. It is the basis of their central dogma, 
that the governing body of the Jehovah's Witnesses is the "faithful and wise servant," 
or as the NWT puts it "the faithful and discrete slave." As such, the governing body 
must be obeyed in all matters and all of their teachings must be accepted. Those who do 
so will survive Armageddon; those who do not, will not. <a href="../mt/24.html#45">24:45</a>

<p><li>Jesus judges the nations. <a href="../mt/25.html#31">25:31-46</a>
 
<p><li>"Eat; this is my body." <br>
Jesus tells his disciples to eat his body and drink his blood. Did he mean this literally or 
figuratively? The question has divided Christians since the Reformation, but it's impossible to 
tell from the passage itself. If God inspired the Bible, shouldn't he have made its interpretation 
clear? <a href="../mt/26.html#26">26:26-28</a>   

<p><li>"I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine,
    until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom."<br>
    WooHoo! There will be wine to drink in heaven. <a href="../mt/26.html#29">26:29</a>

<p><li>The phrase "as it is written in the prophets" is not found in the oldest and best Greek manuscripts which say, rather,

<p><li>The phrase "truly I say unto you" is used by Jesus more than 50 times in the NT. In all verses 
except this one, the Watchtower places the comma after the word "you". But the NWT translates this verse as follows: "Truly I tell you today, 
You will be with me in paradise." 

<p>Why would they do that? Well, the Governing Body doesn't believe in a soul, so they say the good thief died
like everyone else. Only later, nearly 2000 years later, after Armageddon, would he be resurrected. So they 
couldn't let Jesus tell him that he'd be with him that very day in paradise. Instead, they have Jesus say 
that he is telling the truth today (Not yesterday or tomorrow, but today. Or 
maybe "today" here is emphasizing that he's telling the truth today, but he was lying yesterday or 
something) -- and that sometime in the far distant future they'd be together in paradise. <a href="../lk/23.html#43">23:43</a>

Despite its title, First Corinthians wasn't the first epistle that Paul wrote the Corinthians. There was another

<p><li>Jehovah's Witnesses use these verses to justify disfellowshipping those who fail to follow

1 Thessalonians was one of the first Christian writings, yet already (ca.50 CE) believers were getting impatient

<p><li>Although this epistle claims to have been written by Peter, he 
was almost certainly not its author. It is thought to have been written around 90-100 CE, long after Peter's death. The late date is 
suspected because: 1) verses <a href="../2pet/3.html#3"   >3:3-4</a> make excuses for the failure of the expected second coming of Christ, 
2) the author refers to "all of the letters of Paul" in a way that indicates that Paul's epistles were already considered 
equal to "the other scriptures", and 3) the epistle depends upon the letter of Jude, which is thought to have been written around 
80-100 CE. <a href="../2pet/1.html#1">1:1</a>, <a href="../2pet/3.html#1">3:1</a>

    <p><li>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us."<br>

 antichrists instead.) <a href="../1jn/2.html#19">2:19</a>
    
<p><li>"There are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost."
<p>This is the clearest, and pretty much the only, expression of the Trinitarian concept in

modern translations. Here, for example, are verses 5:7-8 in the New Revised 
Standard Version:<br>
"There are three that testify: the 
  Spirit and the water and the blood, and these three agree." 
  <p>Not all Christians agree about how these verses (often called 
  the Johannine comma)  should be treated. See <a href="http://av1611.com/kjbp/faq/holland_1jo5_7.html">here</a> for a KJV-only defense.
