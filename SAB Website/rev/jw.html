<p><li> Will Jesus' second coming be visible to all? Well, not according to the Jehovah's Witnesses, anyway. Even
though Jesus (<a href="../mt/24.html#30">Mt.24:30</a>) says he'll return "on the clouds of heaven with great power and glory" and this verse says
that "every eye shall see him," The Governing Body claims that Jesus returned invisibly in 1914 without clouds,
glory, or being seen by anyone.  <a href="1.html#7">1:7</a>
<p><li>JWs believe that there are two distinct classes of believers: the 144,000 &quot;Anointed" that are going to heaven and 
the "Great Crowd" that will remain here on earth. The WatchTower teaches that heaven closed in 1935, and that everyone else will 
either be killed at Armageddon (if they are not JWs) or live forever on earth. <a href="7.html#4">7:4</a>
<p><li>The "great multitude" is the WatchTower's "great crowd" that it claims will remain on earth 
rather than going to heaven. Yet in this verse the "great crowd" stands "before the thrown" and "before the lamb". Where else 
would the thrown and lamb be besides heaven?  <a href="7.html#9">7:9</a>
<p><li>Jehovah's Witnesses believe that Jesus returned in 1914. This belief is derived from these verses that link "a
time, times, and a half a time" with 1260 days.  <a href="12.html#6">12:6</a>, <a href="12.html#14">14</a>
<p><li>The Watchtower says that "the beast that was, and is not, and yet is" referred to in this verse is the United
Nations. It was the League of Nations which disappeared, only to once again rise as the UN. (See Pay Attention to
Daniel's Prophecy, p. 269)  <a href="17.html#8">17:8</a>
