title="God's 26th Killing">The Midianite massacre: Have you saved all the women alive?</a></b><br>
Under God's direction, Moses' army defeats
the Midianites. They kill all the adult males, but take the women and children
captive. When Moses learns that they left some live, he angrily says: &quot;Have
you saved all the women alive? Kill every male among the little ones, and kill
every woman that hath known man by lying with him. But all the women children,
that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.&quot; So
they went back and did as Moses (and presumably God) instructed, killing
everyone except for the virgins. In this way they got 32,000 virgins -- Wow!
(Even God gets some of the booty -- including the virgins.)<br>
