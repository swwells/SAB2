<i>"Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not  taste of death, till they see 
the Son of man coming in his kingdom."</i> -- Matthew 16:28</tr>

<h2 align="center">MATTHEW</h2>

<table border="0" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="0">
<tr><td colspan="2">

The New Testament gets off to a slow start with the gospel of Matthew, whose first words are: "The book of the generation of 
Jesus Christ." It then lists 39 straight begats, such as "And Naasson begat Salmon; And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab." Believers 
must be bored silly by the end of chapter one, but skeptics shouldn't be. Because the genealogy of Jesus in Matthew directly and completely 
contradicts the one given in Luke. The two don't agree on anything, not even the name of Joseph's father (the granfather 
of Jesus).

<p>But then Matthew is a very contentious book. If you have an opinion about anything, Mathew is likely to disagree with you. The 
SAB lists 99 contradictions in Matthew, more than any other book of the Bible. 

<p>But there's more than just contraditions in Matthew. In it you'll also find that:

<ul>
  <p><li>Jesus strongly approves of the law and the prophets. He hasn't the
    slightest objection to the cruelties of the Old Testament and insists that its laws will be binding forever. 
    5:17
  <p><li>To avoid sin, Jesus recommends that we cut off our hands and pluck
    out our eyes. This advice is given immediately after he says that anyone who
    looks with lust at a women commits adultery. 5:29, 18:8
  <p><li>Jesus tells his disciples not to pray in public. 6:5-6
  <p><li>He says that most people are going to hell. 7:13-14
  <p><li>He sends some devils into a herd of pigs, causing them to run off
    a cliff and drown in the waters below. 8:32
  <p><li>Families will be torn apart because of Jesus (this is one of the few
    &quot;prophecies&quot; in the Bible that has actually come true).
    &quot;Brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the
    child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them
    to be put to death." 10:21
  <p><li>Jesus says that he has come to destroy families by making family
    members hate each other. He has &quot;come not to send peace, but a
    sword.&quot; 10:34
  <p><li>John the Baptist is still not sure about Jesus (he's in prison and
    is soon to die). He sends his disciples to ask, &quot;Art thou he that
    should come, or do we look for another?&quot; Well, if <I>he</I> isn't sure
    after seeing and hearing the events at Jesus' baptism, then how can anyone
    else be? 11:3
  <p><li>Jesus condemns entire cities to dreadful deaths and to the eternal
    torment of hell because they didn't care for his preaching. 11:20-24
  <p><li>He explains that the reason he speaks in parables is so that no
    one will understand him, &quot;lest ... they ... should understand ... and
    should be converted, and I should heal them.&quot; 13:10-15
  <p><li>"For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have
    more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even
    that he hath.&quot; Isn't this from the Republican Party platform? 13:12, 25:29
  <p><li>Jesus is rejected by those who know him the best -- the people of
    his home town of Nazareth. 13:55-57
  <p><li>Herod thought Jesus was a resurrected John the Baptist. Apparently,
    it was a common opinion at the time. If so many of Jesus' contemporaries
    could be so easily fooled regarding John the Baptist, what does this do to
    the credibility of Jesus' resurrection? 14:2, 16:13-14
  <p><li>Jesus mistakenly tells his followers that he will return and
    establish his kingdom within their lifetime. 16:28, 23:36, 24:34
  <p><li>If you abandon your wife and children for Jesus, he'll give your a big
    reward. 19:29
  <p><li>Matthew has Jesus ride into Jerusalem sitting on <I>both</I> an ass
    and a colt (must have taken some practice!). 21:2-7
  <p><li>"His blood be on us, and on our children." This verse blames the Jews for the death of Jesus and has been used
    to justify their persecution for twenty centuries. 27:25

There are 28 generations listed from David to
Jesus in Matthew's genealogy, while Luke's (3:23-31)
has 43. Except for David at one end and Jesus at the other, there are only three names in the
two lists that are the same.<br>

18   Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph,  before they came together, 
she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. 19  Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a 
publick example, was minded to put her away privily. 20   But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD
    appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which 
    is conceived in her is of the  Holy Ghost. 21   And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for
    he shall save his people from their sins. 22   Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the
    Lord by the prophet, saying, 23   Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his 
    name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us. 24   Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the 
    Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife: 25 And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he 
    called his name Jesus.

After listing the genealogy of Jesus, Matthew
tells us that Joseph was not Jesus' father after all, which of course makes the
entire genealogy meaningless. <br>

The prophecy given in Is.7:14 referred not to a virgin but to a young
woman, living at the time of the prophecy. And Jesus, of course, was called
Jesus -- and is not called Emmanuel in any other verse in the New Testament.

Many Christians believe that Mary was
always a virgin, but these verses imply that she and Joseph "came

  Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to 
  Jerusalem, 2 Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to 
  worship him. 3 When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. 4 And when he had 
  gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born. 5 And 
  they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet, 6   And thou Bethlehem, in the land of 
  Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.
  7 Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared. 8 And he sent 
  them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, 
  that I may come and worship him also. 9 When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they
    saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was. 10 When they saw the star, they 
    rejoiced with exceeding great joy. 11 And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary
    his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; 
    gold, and frankincense and  myrrh. 12   And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod,
    they departed into their own country another way.

(2:5-6) <i>"In Bethlehem of Judaea"</i><br>
Matthew claims that Jesus' birth in Bethlehem
fulfils the prophecy in Micah 5:2. But this is
unlikely for two reasons.<ol>
  <li> &quot;Bethlehem Ephratah&quot; in Micah 5:2 refers not to a town, but to a
    clan: the clan of Bethlehem, who was the son of Caleb's second wife,
    Ephrathah (1 Chr.2:18, 2:50-52, 4:4).
  <li> The prophecy (if that is what it is) does not refer to the Messiah, but
    rather to a military leader, as can be seen from <A href="../mic/5.html#6">Micah
    5:6</A>. This leader is supposed to defeat the Assyrians, which, of course,
    Jesus never did.</ol>
  <p style="margin-left: 10">
It should also be noted that Matthew altered the text of Micah 5:2 by saying:
&quot;And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda&quot; rather than &quot;Bethlehem
Ephratah&quot; as is said in Micah 5:2. He did this, intentionally no doubt, to
make the verse appear to refer to the town of Bethlehem rather than the family
clan.</P>

13 And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the

child to destroy him. 14  When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt: 15 And was 
there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt

<img src="../images/pr1.gif" height="30">( 2:15) <i>&quot;Out of Egypt I have called my son,&quot;</i><BR>
Matthew claims that the flight of Jesus' family to Egypt is a fulfillment of Hosea 11:1. But Hosea 11:1 is not a prophecy at 
all, as is clear when the entire verse is quoted ("When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt."). 
It is a reference to the Hebrew exodus from Egypt and has nothing to do with Jesus. Matthew tries to hide
this fact by quoting only the last part of the verse.

16 Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children 
that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he 
had diligently enquired of the wise men. 17 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, 18 In Rama 
was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not 
be comforted, because they are not.

<font size="-1">
<img src="../images/sci1.gif" height="30"> (2:16) Herod kills all boys in and around Bethlehem that are two years old and under. 
Such a massacre would certainly have been noted by contemporary historians. Yet not even Josephus, who documented Herod's
life in detail, mentioned this event.
  <p style="margin-left: 10">
<img src="../images/pr1.gif" height="30">(2:17-18)<br>Matthew quotes Jeremiah 31:15, claiming that it was a prophecy of 
King Herod's alleged slaughter of the children in and around Bethlehem after the birth of Jesus. But this verse
refers to the Babylonian captivity, as is clear by reading the next two verses (16 and 17), and, thus, has nothing to do with 
Herod's massacre.

19 But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, 20 Saying, Arise, and take 
the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life. 21 And 
he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. 22 But when he heard that Archelaus did 
reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, 
he turned aside into the parts of Galilee: 23 And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be
    fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. 4 And the same John had his 
raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey. 5 Then went out to

John has a good point in v.14. If Jesus is the sinless Son of God, then 
shouldn't Jesus be baptizing John instead of the reverse? Isn't baptism supposed to forgive sins and be a sign of repentance? 
If so, then why would Jesus need to be baptized? And what the heck is "it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness" supposed to 
mean?

In Matthew's gospel, God addresses those witnessing Jesus' baptism saying,
&quot;<I>This</I> is my beloved son ....&quot; But Mark 1:11 and Luke 3:22
have God speak to Jesus directly&quot; &quot;<I>Thou</I> art my beloved son
....&quot; But whatever the exact wording, it seems strange that after
witnessing this event, John the Baptist is still unsure about Jesus (see Mt.11:2-3).<br>
