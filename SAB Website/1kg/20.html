  And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings
    of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put
    sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of
    Israel: peradventure he will save thy life.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="32">20:32</A></B>
  So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and
    came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Benhadad saith, I pray
    thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="33">20:33</A></B>
  Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him,
    and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy brother Benhadad. Then he said,
    Go ye, bring him. Then Benhadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come
    up into the chariot.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And <span class="i">Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy

    King Ahab is merciful to king Beh-hadad. God will later kill him and his family for it. (See <a href="#42">1 Kings 20:42</a> and

There was this son of a prophet that said to his neighbor, 
"Smite me." But the neighbor refused. So God sent a lion to devour him. True story.

<p>(20:35) <i>"A certain man of
    the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the LORD,
    Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him."</i>
    
<p>(20:36) <b><i>"Then said he unto him,
    Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou
    art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed
    from him, a lion found him, and slew him."</i></b><br>

The prophet tells king Ahab that he will be killed and his people punished for not killing  
Ben-hadad: "Your life shall go for his life, and your people for his people."<br>
(See <a href="22.html#35">1 Kings 22:35</a> for

<p>They say that God is merciful. But when King Ahab is merciful, God kills him for it.
See <a href="../1sam/15.html#2">1 Samuel 15:2-3</a> for a similar example of God's mercy.
