    <img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (12:3-7) God tells Ezekiel to move his stuff. He tells him to move it in the daylight; to dig through a 
    wall with his hand and carry his stuff out; and to move his stuff in the twilight, with his face covered so he can't see the ground. So that's what he did. 
    
    <p>(12:3) <i>"Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to 
    another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they be a rebellious house."</i>

    <p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (12:9-12) After Ezekiel moved his stuff, God asked if anyone asked him what he was doing? If they do ask, God told him 
    to say that they will soon be moving their stuff, too, when God forces them into captivity.
    
    <p>(12:9) <i>"Son of man, hath not the house of Israel ... said unto thee, What doest thou?"</i>

<img src="../images/cr1.gif"> (12:18-20) God has Ezekiel do another clever demonstration: eat and drink carefully while shaking. That way, when the 
people see him doing that, they will know that God is going to starve them to death, which will teach them that God is the Lord. 

<p>(12:18) <i>"Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulness;"</i>

<p>(12:19) <i>"Say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord ... They shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their water with astonishment,

<p>(12:22) <i>"Son of man, what is that proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth?"</i>

<p>(12:23) <i>"Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel;

<p>(12:27) <i>"Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth is for many days to come,
 and he prophesieth of the times that are far off."</i>

  For I am the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall
    come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for in your days, O rebellious
    house, will I say the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord GOD.

  Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying.
  
  <tr><td><B><A name="27">12:27</A></B>
  Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he
    seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of the times that are far
    off.
  <tr><td><B><A name="28">12:28</A></B>
  Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; There shall none of my
    words be prolonged any more, but the word which I have spoken shall be done,
    saith the Lord GOD.
