    son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim.

    <IMG src="../images/inj1.gif" > (10:6-16) This is the fifth time that the same stupid story is repeated in Judges. 
    (See <a href="2.html#14">Judges 2:14</a>, <a href="3.html#8">3:8</a>, <a href="4.html#2">4:2</a>, and <a href="6.html#1">6:1</a> for the others.) 
    So you know what's going to happen: The Israelites do evil in the sight of the Lord; God gets angry and sells them as slaves; the Israelites cry out to God; and God slaughters the people he sold the 
    Israelites to.
    
    <p>A few details change each time the story is told: the number of years the Israelites are enslaved, the people that God sells them to, and the person God chooses to help with the massacre. 
    This time God chose Jephthah.

    and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of

  And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel: eighteen
    years, all the children of Israel that were on the other side Jordan in the
    land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.
