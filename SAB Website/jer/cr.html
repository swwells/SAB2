<BODY>

<p><li>"I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction." <a href="4.html#6">4:6</a>

<p><li>"The lion is come up from his thicket ... and thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant." <a href="4.html#7">4:7</a>

<p><li>Lament and howl: for the fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from us." <a href="4.html#8">4:8</a>

<p><li> What was once fruitful is now barren.  Birds have fled, people are gone, towns are in ruins.  All "by his (God's) fierce anger." 
<a href="4.html#25">4:25-26</a>

<p><li>God tries to reform people by tormenting them and then wonders why it doesn't work. <a href="5.html#3">5:3</a>

<a href="5.html#15">5:15-17</a>

<p><li> God will punish the men by taking away their property, including their wives, and giving it to others.
 <a href="6.html#12">6:12</a>

<p><li> God plans to kill pretty much everyone: fathers and sons, 
family, friends, and neighbors. God plans to kill them all after laying a stumbling block before them.
 <a href="6.html#21">6:21</a>
 
<p><li>God will send soldiers from the north that will kill everyone and 
have no mercy. <a href="6.html#22">6:22-23</a>

<p><li> God will pour out his anger on both man and beast. Not even the trees will 
be spared from his wrath. And the ground itself will burn forever.  <a href="7.html#20">7:20</a>

<p><li> God will feed the people to the birds and the beasts, &quot;and none shall fray 
them away.&quot;&nbsp;  <a href="7.html#33">7:33</a>

<p><li> God will cover the earth with dead bodies that will not be buried. "They shall be for dung 
upon the face of the earth."  <a href="8.html#2">8:2</a>

<p><li> People will choose to kill themselves, rather than be killed by their vicious 
God.  <a href="8.html#3">8:3</a>

sword. <a href="9.html#15">9:15-16</a>

<p><li> God will kill children and young men, and the dead bodies "shall fall as dung .... and none shall 
gather them."  <a href="9.html#21">9:21-22</a>

<p><li> "Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all them which are circumcised with the 
uncircumcised."  I guess that'd include just about everyone -- well, all the men 
anyway.  <a href="9.html#25">9:25-26</a>

<p><li> Jeremiah prays for the destruction of people and families that don't call on God's name. 
<a href="10.html#25">10:25</a>

<p><li> God &quot;will bring evil upon&quot; people from which they will not be able to escape. And if they 
cry out to him for help, he will not help them.  <a href="11.html#11">11:11</a>

<p><li> God forbids others from praying for his victims. Such prayers would go unanswered anyway, he says, 
because he &quot;will not hear them in their time of trouble.&quot;  <a href="11.html#14">11:14</a>

<a href="12.html#3">12:3</a>

nation." <a href="12.html#17">12:17</a>

<p><li>God tells Jeremiah not to pray for the people. God has decided to kill them all and he doesn't want to

themselves.  <a href="14.html#15">14:15-16</a>

<p><li>God tells Jeremiah not to bother praying for the people. Even if Moses and Samuel (and 
Jesus?) were to ask him to reconsider, he wouldn't. He's going to kill everybody and nobody can stop him!
<a href="15.html#1">15:1</a>

<p><li>God has it all planned out. He'll kill some with the sword, some with famine, and he'll feed the rest to the dogs and birds. 
Why will he do these terrible things? Because of something a former king did.  <a href="15.html#2">15:2-4</a>

<p><li> God again threatens Jerusalem with mass destruction.  Here are some of the highlights: 
He will kill children, make more widows than there are grains of 
sand, terrorize cities, and then kill the survivors. <a href="15.html#7">15:7-9</a>

<p><li> "A fire is kindled in mine anger, which shall burn upon you." <a href="15.html#14">15:14</a>

<p><li> God tells Jeremiah not to get married or have children, because he's 
going to kill everyone (mothers and daughters, fathers and sons). They all &quot;shall die of grievous 
deaths,&quot; and that shall neither &quot;be lamented&quot; nor buried, but &quot;shall 
be as dung upon the face of the earth.&quot;  For he has removed peace, "lovingkindness," and mercy 
from the people.  <a href="16.html#1">16:1-7</a>

<p><li> God will make parents eat their own children, and friends eat each other. <a href="19.html#7">19:7-9</a>

<p><li>God will break those who worship other gods as though they were made of clay, killing 
so many that there will not be enough room to bury them all. <a href="19.html#11">19:11-13</a>

<p><li>"Thus saith the LORD ... I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against
    it, because they have hardened their necks, that they might not hear my words." <a href="19.html#15">19:15</a>

with a strong arm."  <a href="21.html#5">21:5</a>

<p><li>"I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great
    pestilence." <a href="21.html#6">21:6</a>
    
<p><li> God will deliver Zedekiah and those that survive the famine, disease, and war into Nebuchadrezzar's hand, 
and &quot;he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither
have pity, nor have mercy.  <a href="21.html#7">21:7</a>

<p><li>God will have Jeconiah's enemies kill him and his mother and then 
ensure that he die without leaving any sons. <a href="22.html#25">22:25-30</a>

Jerusalem and enslave Judah. <a href="25.html#6">25:6-11</a>

<p><li>God will force "all the kingdoms of the world" to drink "and be 
drunken." Then he'll kill "all the inhabitants of the earth" with a sword. <a href="25.html#15">25:15-29</a>

<p><li>God is really getting into all of this killing. He roars, he mightily roars, and shouts. He "pleads with all flesh" 
while an whirlwind roars and a noise can be heard everywhere on earth. <a href="25.html#30">25:30-32</a>

<p><li> God will kill so many people that the entire earth will be covered with their dead bodies. No one is to 
mourn them or even bury them; &quot;they shall be dung upon the ground.&quot;  <a href="25.html#31">25:33-39</a>

<p><li>God will destroy "the peaceable habitations" and make the land desolate "because of his fierce anger."

<p><li> God litters the ground "with the dead bodies of men" that he has killed in 
his anger and fury. <a href="33.html#5">33:5</a>

<p><li>To punish the people for refusing to free their slaves, God over-reacts (just a tad) by 
threatening to send the sword, pestilence, and 
famine, saying he'll feed their dead bodies to the fowls and beasts of the earth. <a href="34.html#17">34:17-20</a>

<p><li> All those who move to Egypt will die by the sword, famine, or pestilence. None &quot;shall 
escape from the evil&quot; that comes directly from God. But many, including Jews, have moved to Egypt 
and most seem to have escaped from God's promised evil.  <a href="42.html#15">42:15-18, 22</a>

<p><li>God's not finished with Judah. He'll bring more evil upon them. Even those Jews that flee to Egypt will not be spared. 
God will hunt them down and kill them all with war, famine, and disease.   <a href="44.html#11">44:11-13</a>
