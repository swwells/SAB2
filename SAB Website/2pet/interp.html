<p><li>Although this epistle claims to have been written by Peter, he 
was almost certainly not its author. It is thought to have been written around 90-100 CE, long after Peter's death. The late date is 
suspected because: 1) verses <a href="3.html#3"   >3:3-4</a> make excuses for the failure of the expected second coming of Christ, 
2) the author refers to "all of the letters of Paul" in a way that indicates that Paul's epistles were already considered 
equal to "the other scriptures", and 3) the epistle depends upon the letter of Jude, which is thought to have been written around 
80-100 CE. <a href="1.html#1">1:1</a>, <a href="3.html#1">3:1</a>

<p><li>"No prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation."<br>
That's just your interpretation. <a href="1.html#20">1:20</a>

<p><li>"Submit yourselves  ... to the king ... for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well."<br>
Monachy is the Biblically-approved form of government whose purpose is to punish evildoers and praise do-gooders. <a href="2.html#13">2:13-14</a>
