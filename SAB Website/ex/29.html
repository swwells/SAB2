<b>Killing animals for God</b><br>
Get some animals, kill them, chop up their bodies, wave body parts in the air, burn the carcasses, and sprinkle the
blood all around -- in precisely the way God tells you. It may well make you
sick, but it makes God feel good. <br>
<A href="../contra/desire.html">Does God desire animal sacrifices?</a><br>
<A href="../contra/burnt.html">Did God command the Israelites to make burnt offerings?</a>

<p>(29:11) <i>"Thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD."</i>

<p>(29:12) <i>"Thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, 
and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar."</i>

<b>Smearing blood on ears, thumbs, and big toes</b><br>
God tells Moses to kill a ram and put the
blood on the tip of Aaron's right ear, and on his right thumb, and on his right
big toe, and then sprinkle the blood around the altar. Finally, sprinkle some on
Aaron and his sons and on their garments. This will make them
&quot;hallowed.&quot;

<p>(29:20) <i>"Then shalt thou kill the ram, and <b>take of his blood, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon
    the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right

    <p>(29:21) <i>"Thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar ... and sprinkle it upon Aaron,

God tells Aaron and his sons to take the
rump, fat, caul, kidneys, and right shoulder of the ram and add a loaf of bread
or two, and a wafer of unleavened bread. Then they put the whole mess in the
hands of Aaron and his sons and they wave them before the Lord. This is a wave
offering.

<p>(29:22) <i>"Thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards,
