The kingdom of heaven is, according to Jesus, like the king in this parable. If so, I'd stay away from there if I were you.
  
  <p>The parable begins with the king sending servants to invite everyone to come to his son's wedding feast. But they all made excuses 
  for not coming, and some even killed the king's messengers. So the king sent an army to kill the people that killed his messengers, burning 
  down the city, as well. The king sent out more servants, telling them to invite everyone, good or bad. At the banquet the king 
  noticed that one guest didn't have on a wedding garment, so the king tied him up and "cast him into the outer darkness" where 
  "there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth." 
   
  <p>(22:1-2) <i>"Jesus ... said ... the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son."</i>
  
  <p>(22:3) <i>"And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding:
    and they would not come."</i>
    
    <p>(22:4-5) <i>"Again, he sent forth other servants, saying ... come unto the marriage. But they made light of it, 
    and went their ways."</i>
    
    <p>(22:6) <i>"And the remnant took his servants ... and slew them."</i>
    
    <p>(22:8-10) <i>"Then saith he to his servants ...  as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage, both bad and good."</i><br>
    <a href="../contra/good.html">Is anyone good?</a>"</i>
    
    <p>(22:11-12) <i>"When the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment: 
    And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless."</i>    
   
    <p>(22:12-13) <i>"Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot ... and cast him into outer darkness, 
    there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."</i><br>

  And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew

  Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to
