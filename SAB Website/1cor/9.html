In an apparent reference to his supposed
encounter with Jesus on the road to Damascus, Paul asks, &quot;Have I not seen
Jesus?&quot; Well, if we can believe Acts, he didn't. That account says he was
blinded and saw no one (<A href="../acts/9.html#8">Acts 9:8</A>).<br>

<img src="../images/inj1.gif" width="32" height="32">(9:9-10) Paul quotes <a href="../dt/25.html#4">Dt.25:4</a>, "Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that 
treadeth out the corn." That sounds like a nice humane law. Until Paul explains it, that is. He asks, "Does God care about oxen?", and 
then answers his own rhetorical question by saying, "Hell no. The law is for our sakes." 
According to Paul, God doesn't give a damn about animals.
