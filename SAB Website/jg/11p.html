  Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he was the son

  And Gilead's wife bare him sons; and his wife's sons grew up, and they

  Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and

  And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made

  And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel,
    the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob:<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and expel

    distress?<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="8">11:8</A></B>
  And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to

    Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of

  Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray

    consent: and Israel abode in Kadesh.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of

      When "the spirit of the Lord" comes upon Jephthah, he makes a deal with God: If God will help him kill the Ammonites, then he (Jephthah) will offer 
to God as a burnt offering whatever comes out of his house to greet him. God keeps his end of the deal by providing
Jephthah with "a very great slaughter."
