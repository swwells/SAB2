<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>7:4</b>   And when Corihor was thirty and two years old he rebelled against his father, and went over and dwelt in 
the land of Nehor; and he begat sons and daughters, and they became exceedingly fair; wherefore Corihor drew away many 
people after him. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>7:5</b>   And when he had gathered together an army he came up unto 
  <span class="a">the land of Moron</span> where the king dwelt, and 
took him captive, which brought to pass the saying of the brother of Jared that they would be brought into captivity. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>7:6</b>   Now <span class="a">the land of Moron</span>, where the king dwelt, was near the land which is called Desolation by the Nephites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>7:8</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Shule was angry with his brother; and Shule waxed strong, and became mighty as 
to the strength of a man; and he was also mighty in judgment. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>7:9</b>   Wherefore, he came to the hill Ephraim, and 
	<span class="sci">he</span> did molten out of the hill, and
	<span class="sci">made swords out of steel </span>for those whom he had drawn away with him; and after he had armed them with swords he returned to the city Nehor and gave

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>7:10</b>   And now because of the thing which Shule had done, his father bestowed upon him the kingdom; therefore 
he began to reign in the stead of his father. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>7:11</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that he did execute judgment in righteousness; and he did spread his kingdom upon

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>7:13</b>   And Corihor repented of the many evils which he had done; wherefore Shule gave him power in his 
kingdom. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>7:14</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Corihor had many sons and daughters. And among the sons of Corihor there was 
one whose name was Noah. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>7:15</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Noah rebelled against Shule, the king, and also his father Corihor, and 
drew away Cohor his brother, and also all his brethren and many of the people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>7:16</b>   And he gave battle unto Shule the king, in which he did obtain the land of their first inheritance; 
and he became a king over that part of the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>7:17</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that he gave battle again unto Shule, the king; and he took Shule, the king, 
and carried him away captive into Moron. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>7:18</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> as he was about to put him to death, the sons of Shule crept into the house of 
Noah by night and slew him, and broke down the door of the prison and brought out their father, and placed him upon 
his throne in his own kingdom. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>7:19</b>   Wherefore, the son of Noah did build up his kingdom in his stead; nevertheless they did not gain power 
any more over Shule the king, and the people who were under the reign of Shule the king did prosper 
	<span class="a">exceedingly</span> and wax 
great. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>7:20</b>   And the country was divided; and there were two kingdoms, the kingdom of Shule, and the kingdom of Cohor, 
the son of Noah. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>7:21</b>   And Cohor, the son of Noah, caused that his people should give battle unto Shule, in which Shule 
did beat them and did slay Cohor. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>7:22</b>   And now Cohor had a son who was called Nimrod; and Nimrod gave up the kingdom of Cohor unto Shule, 
and he did gain favor in the eyes of Shule; wherefore Shule did bestow great favors upon him, and he did do in the 
kingdom of Shule according to his desires. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>7:23</b>   And also in the reign of Shule there came prophets among the people, who were sent from the Lord, 
prophesying that the wickedness and idolatry of the people was bringing a curse upon the land, and they should be 
destroyed if they did not repent. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>7:24</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the people did revile against the prophets, and did mock them.  
	<span class="a">And it came 
to pass</span> that king Shule did execute judgment against all those who did revile against the prophets. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>7:25</b>   And he did execute a law throughout all the land, which gave power unto the prophets that they should 
go whithersoever they would; and by this cause the people were brought unto repentance. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>7:26</b>   And because the people did repent of their iniquities and idolatries the Lord did spare them, and they 
began to prosper again in the land.  And it came to pass that Shule begat sons and daughters in his old age. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>7:27</b>   And there were no more wars in the days of Shule; and he remembered the great things that the Lord had 
done for his fathers in bringing them across the great deep into the promised land; wherefore he did execute judgment 
in righteousness all his days. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
