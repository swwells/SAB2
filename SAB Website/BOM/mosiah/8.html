<td bgcolor="eeeeee">


<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>8:1</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that after king Limhi had made an end of speaking to his 
people, for he spake many things unto them and only a few of them have I written in this book, he told his people all 
the things concerning their brethren who were in the land of Zarahemla. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a> (8:1, 4, 5)
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>8:2</b>   And he caused that Ammon should stand up before the multitude, and rehearse unto them all that had 
happened unto their brethren from the time that Zeniff went up out of the land even until the time that he himself came 
up out of the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>8:3</b>   And he also rehearsed unto them the last words which king Benjamin had taught them, and explained them 
to the people of king Limhi, so that they might understand all the words which he spake. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>8:4</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that after he had done all this, that king Limhi dismissed 
the multitude, and caused that they should return every one unto his own house. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>8:5</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that he caused that the plates which contained the record 
of his people from the time that they left the land of Zarahemla, should be brought before Ammon, that he might read 
them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>8:6</b>   Now, as soon as Ammon had read the record, the king inquired of him to know if he could interpret 
languages, and Ammon told him that he could not. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>8:7</b>   And the king said unto him: Being grieved for the afflictions of my people, I caused that forty and 
three of my people should take a journey into the wilderness, that thereby they might find the land of Zarahemla, that 
we might appeal unto our brethren to deliver us out of bondage. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>8:8</b>   And they were lost in the wilderness for the space of many days, yet they were diligent, and found not 
the land of Zarahemla but returned to this land, having traveled in a land among many waters, having discovered a land 
which was covered with bones of men, and of beasts, and was also covered with ruins of buildings of every kind, having 
discovered a land which had been peopled with a people who were as numerous as the hosts of Israel. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>8:9</b>   And for a testimony that the things that they had said are true they have brought twenty-four plates 
which are filled with engravings, and they are of pure gold. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>8:10</b>   And behold, also, they have brought breastplates, which are large, and they are of brass and of copper, 
and are perfectly sound. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>8:11</b>   And again, they have brought <span class="sci">swords</span>, the hilts thereof have perished, and the blades thereof were 
cankered with rust; and there is no one in the land that is able to interpret the language or the engravings that are 
on the plates.  Therefore I said unto thee: Canst thou translate? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/sci1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1">Ammon finds ancient swords. If swords existed in pre-Columbian America, why is there no evidence of it 
today?</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>8:12</b>   And I say unto thee again: Knowest thou of any one that can translate?  For I am desirous that these 
records should be translated into our language; for, perhaps, they will give us a knowledge of a remnant of the people 
who have been destroyed, from whence these records came; or, perhaps, they will give us a knowledge of this very people 
who have been destroyed; and I am desirous to know the cause of their destruction. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>8:13</b>   Now Ammon said unto him: I can assuredly tell thee, O king, of a man that can translate the records; 
for he has wherewith that he can look, and translate all records that are of ancient date; and it is a gift from God.  
And the things are called interpreters, and no man can look in them except he be commanded, lest he should look for that 
he ought not and he should perish.   And whosoever is commanded to look in them, the same is called seer. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>8:14</b>   And behold, the king of the people who are in the land of Zarahemla is the man that is commanded to do 
these things, and who has this high gift from God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>8:15</b>   And the king said that <span class="a">a seer is greater than a prophet.</span> 
<td bgcolor="eeeeee" rowspan="2" valign="top">

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32"><br>
<font size="-1">A seer is greater than a prophet. He is a revelator with a Divine gift that is greater than all others.</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>8:16</b>   And Ammon said that <span class="a">a seer is a revelator and a prophet also; and a 
gift which is greater can no man have</span>, except he should possess the power of God, which no man can; yet a man may have 
great power given him from God. 

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>8:17</b>   But a seer can know of things which are past, and also of things which are to come, and by them shall 
all things be revealed, or, rather, shall secret things be made manifest, and hidden things shall come to light, and 
things which are not known shall be made known by them, and also things shall be made known by them which otherwise could 
not be known. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>8:18</b>   Thus God has provided a means that man, through faith, might work mighty miracles; therefore he becometh 
a great benefit to his fellow beings. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>8:19</b>   And now, when Ammon had made an end of speaking these words the king rejoiced 
<span class="a">exceedingly</span>, and gave thanks to God, saying: Doubtless a great mystery is contained within these 
plates, and these interpreters were doubtless prepared for the purpose of unfolding all such mysteries to the children 
of men. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<a href="exceed_list.html">Exceedingly</a>
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>8:20</b>   O how marvelous are the works of the Lord, and how long doth he suffer with his people; yea, and how 
blind and impenetrable are the understandings of the children of men; for they will not seek wisdom, neither do they 
desire that she should rule over them! <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>8:21</b>   Yea, they are as a wild flock which fleeth from the shepherd, and scattereth, and are driven, and are 
devoured by the beasts of the forest. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
