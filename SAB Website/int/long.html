<p><b><a href="../gen/int_list.html">Genesis</a></b>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../gen/int.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p><li>God gives Abraham and his descendants all of the land of Canaan forever. This 
promise is still used to justify the unending battles over the land in the 
Middle East. <a href="../gen/13.html#14">13:14-15</a>, <a href="../gen/17.html#8">17:8</a>

<p><li>An uncircumcised boy is to be abandoned by his parents and community.  
<a href="../gen/17.html#14">17:14</a>

<p><li>God kills everyone (men, women, children, infants, newborns) in Sodom and Gomorrah
by raining "fire and brimstone from the Lord out of heaven." Well, almost everyone -- he
spares the "just and righteous" Lot and his family.<a href="../gen/19.html#24">19:24</a>
<p><li>Lot's nameless wife looks back, and God turns her into a pillar of salt. 
 <a href="../gen/19.html#26">19:26</a>
 
 <p><li>Abraham makes his servant swear that he won't let Isaac marry 
a Canaanite. <a href="../gen/24.html#3">24:3</a>
<p><li>Isaac tells Jacob not to marry a Canaanite. <a href="../gen/28.html#1">28:1</a>

<p><li>Jacob's sons can't stand the idea of their sister marrying someone who is uncircumcised. <a href="../gen/34.html#14">34:14</a>

<p><li>"And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord; and the Lord slew him."
What did Er do to elicit God's wrath? The Bible doesn't say. Maybe he picked up some sticks
on Saturday.  <a href="../gen/38.html#7">38:7</a>

<p><li>After God killed Er, Judah tells Onan to "go in unto they brother's wife." But "Onan
knew that the seed should not be his; and ... when he went in unto his brother's wife ... he
spilled it on the ground.... And the thing which he did displeased the Lord; wherefore he slew
him also." This lovely Bible story is seldom read in Sunday School, but it is the basis of many
Christian doctrines, including the condemnation of both masturbation and birth control. 
 <a href="../gen/38.html#8">38:8-10</a>
 
<p><li>After Judah pays Tamar for her services, he is told that she "played the harlot" and "is
with child by whoredom." When Judah hears this, he says, "Bring her forth, and let her be
burnt." <a href="../gen/38.html#24">38:24</a>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="3303" endspan --><p><b><a href="../ex/int_list.html">Exodus</a></b>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../ex/int.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->
<p><li>God decides to kill Moses because his son had not yet been circumcised. <a href="../ex/4.html#24">4:24-26</a>
<p><li>God will kill the Egyptian children to show that he puts "a difference between the Egyptians and Israel." 
<a href="../ex/11.html#7">11:7</a>

<p><li>After God has sufficiently hardened the Pharaoh's heart, he kills all the firstborn Egyptian children. When he was finished
"there was not a house where there was not one dead." Finally, he runs out of little babies to kill, so he slaughters the firstborn
cattle, too. <a href="../ex/12.html#29">12:29</a>

<p><li>No stranger, foreigner, or uncircumcised person can eat the Passover. 
<a href="../ex/12.html#43">12:43, 45, 48</a>

<p><li>If you do what God says, he won't send his diseases on you (like he did to the Egyptians). 
But otherwise.... <a href="../ex/15.html#26">15:26</a>

<p><li>When the people complain to Moses, he tells them they aren't complaining about him, but about God, making 
them apostates and heretics, and therefore deserve severe punishment. Religious leaders have 
used this tactic ever since. <a href="../ex/16.html#8">16:8</a>

<p><li>Joshua, with God's approval, kills the Amalekites "with the edge of the sword." 
<a href="../ex/17.html#13">17:13</a>

<p><li>The Lord will have war with Amalek from
generation to generation."  <a href="../ex/17.html#14">17:14</a>

<p><li>"The Lord has sworn [God swears!] that the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation." So God
is still fighting Amalek. I hope Moses can still keep his hand up. <a href="../ex/17.html#14">17:14-16</a>
 
<p><li>God favors Israelites "above all people."  <a href="../ex/19.html#5">19:5</a>

<p><li>The first commandment ("Thou shalt have no other gods before me.") condemns those who worship any other than the
biblical god.  <a href="../ex/20.html#3">20:3</a>

<p><li>"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live." Thousands of innocent women have suffered excruciating deaths because of this
verse.  <a href="../ex/22.html#18">22:18</a>

<p><li>"He who sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the Lord only, he shall be utterly destroyed." If this commandment is obeyed,
then the four billion people who do not believe in the biblical god must be killed.  <a href="../ex/22.html#20">22:20</a>

<p><li> Don't even mention the names of the other gods. <a href="../ex/23.html#13">23:13</a>

<p><li>Do not allow others to worship a different god. Conquer them 
and destroy their religious property. <a href="../ex/23.html#24">23:24</a>

<p><li>God promises to "send his fear before the Israelites" and 
to kill everyone that they encounter when they enter the promised land. 
<a href="../ex/23.html#27">23:27</a>

<p><li>Stay away from those who worship a different god. <a href="../ex/23.html#32">23:32</a>

<p><li>Don't let any strangers attend your animal sacrifices. <a href="../ex/29.html#33">29:33</a>

<p><li>Whoever puts holy oil on a stranger shall be "cut off from his people." 
<a href="../ex/30.html#33">30:33</a>

<p><li>Those who break the Sabbath are to be executed. <a href="../ex/31.html#14">31:14</a>

<p><li>Moses burned the golden calf, ground it into powder, and then forced it down the throats 
of all the people. <a href="../ex/32.html#20">32:20</a>

<p><li>God orders the sons of Levi (Moses, Aaron, and the other members of their tribe that were "on the Lord's side") to kill
"every man his neighbor." "And there fell of the people that day about 3000 men." <a href="../ex/32.html#27">32:27-28</a>

<p><li>"Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I
    blot out of my book." <a href="../ex/32.html#33">32:33</a>
    
<p><li>God drives out the pagan tribes and commands the Israelites to destroy their altars and places of worship.  
<a href="../ex/34.html#11">34:11-14</a>

<p><li>God, "whose name is Jealous", will not tolerate the worship of any other god. <a href="../ex/34.html#14">34:14</a>

<p><li>"Thou shalt make thee no molten gods." <a href="../ex/34.html#17">34:17</a>

<p><li>Whoever works, or even kindles a fire, on the Sabbath "shall be put to death." <a href="../ex/35.html#2">35:2-3</a>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="41610" endspan --><p><b><a href="../lev/int_list.html">Leviticus</a></b>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../lev/int.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->
<p><li>Two of the sons of Aaron "offered strange fire before the Lord" and "there went out fire
from the Lord, and devoured them, and they died before the Lord." <a href="../lev/10.html#1">10:1-2</a>

<p><li>Moses tells Aaron that his sons were burned to death to sanctify and glorify God. <a href="../lev/10.html#3">10:3</a>

<p><li> Moses tells Aaron's cousins to drag the burned bodies out of the camp, and he warns Aaron not to mourn the death of his sons or God will 
    kill him too, along with everyone else. <a href="../lev/10.html#4">10:4-6</a>

<p><li>"When ye be come into the land of Canaan ... I put the plague of leprosy in ... the land of your possession."<br>
God "put the plague of leprosy" on the Canaanites.  <a href="../lev/14.html#34">14:34</a>

<p><li>Homosexual acts are an abomination to God. <a href="../lev/18.html#22">18:22</a>

<p><li>"Keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not commit any of these abominations ... that the land spue not you out also, 
when ye defile it, as it spued out the nations that were before you." <a href="../lev/18.html#26">18:26-28</a>

<p><li>"Whosoever shall commit any of these abominations ... shall be cut off from among their people." <a href="../lev/18.html#29">18:29</a>

<p><li>"Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times."<br>
Don't eat anything with blood, or use magic or astrology. <a href="../lev/19.html#26">19:26</a>
 
<p><li>"Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard."<br>
Don't round the corners of your head or beard.  <a href="../lev/19.html#27">19:27</a>
 
 <p><li>"Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you."<br>
Don't get an tatoos.  <a href="../lev/19.html#28">19:28</a>

<p><li>Stay away from wizards and people with familiar spirits.  <a href="../lev/19.html#31">19:31</a>

<p><li>Stay away from people with familiar spirits and don't &quot;go a whoring&quot; after them either.
<a href="../lev/20.html#6">20:6</a>

<p><li>If a man has sex with another man, kill them both. <a href="../lev/20.html#13">20:13</a>

<p><li>People with "familiar spirits" (witches, fortune tellers, etc.) are to be 
stoned to death. <a href="../lev/20.html#27">20:27</a>

<p><li>Handicapped people cannot approach the altar of God. They would "profane" it. 
 <a href="../lev/21.html#16">21:16-23</a>
 
<p><li>No stranger or slave can "eat of the holy thing." <a href="../lev/22.html#10">22:10, 13</a>

<p><li>If a priest's daughter marries "a stranger" she can't eat any holy things. <a href="../lev/22.html#12">22:12</a>

<p><li>God won't accept animal sacrifices from strangers, since strangers have blemishes and are corrupt. <a href="../lev/22.html#19">22:25</a>

<p><li>Don't do any work on the day of atonement or God will destroy you.
 <a href="../lev/23.html#29">23:29-30</a>
 
<p><li>A man curses and blasphemes while disputing with another man. Moses asks God what to 
do about it. God says that the whole community must stone him to death. "And the children of Israel did as the Lord 
and Moses commanded." <a href="../lev/24.html#10">24:10-23</a>

 <p><li>Anyone who blasphemes or curses shall be stoned to death by the entire community. 
 <a href="../lev/24.html#16">24:16</a>

<p><li>God tells the Israelites to make slaves out of their neighbors and their families. The "heathens" and
"strangers" are to be their possessions forever.  <a href="../lev/25.html#44">25:44-46</a>

<p><li>If you don't follow all of the laws in the Old Testament, God will shower you with all of the curses in the next 25 verses. 
<a href="../lev/26.html#14">26:14-15</a>

<p><li>"I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning
    ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed
    in vain, for your enemies shall eat it."  <a href="../lev/26.html#16">26:16</a>
    
<p><li>"I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies." <a href="../lev/26.html#17">26:17</a>

<p><li>"And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins." 
<a href="../lev/26.html#18">26:18</a>

<p><li>"I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins." <a href="../lev/26.html#21">26:21</a>
    
<p><li>"I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle." <a href="../lev/26.html#22">26:22</a>

<p><li>"I ... will punish you yet (another) seven times for your sins." <a href="../lev/26.html#24">26:24</a>

<p><li>"I will bring a sword upon you ... I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy." 
<a href="../lev/26.html#25">26:25</a>

<p><li>"And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me ... then ... I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins." 
<a href="../lev/26.html#27">26:27-28</a>

<p><li>"And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat." <a href="../lev/26.html#29">26:29</a>

<p><li>"I will ... cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you." <a href="../lev/26.html#30">26:30</a>

<p><li>"And I will make your cities waste." <a href="../lev/26.html#31">26:31</a>

<p><li>"And I will bring the land into desolation". <a href="../lev/26.html#32">26:32</a>

<p><li>"And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste." 
<a href="../lev/26.html#33">26:33</a>

<p><li>"And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a 
shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth." 
<a href="../lev/26.html#36">26:36</a>

<p><li>"And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your 
enemies." <a href="../lev/26.html#37">26:37</a>

<p><li>"And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up." <a href="../lev/26.html#38">26:38</a>

<p><li>"And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their 
fathers shall they pine away with them." <a href="../lev/26.html#39">26:39</a>

<p><li>God defines the value of human life in dollars and cents. Of course, to God, females
are worth considerably less than males (50 - 60%) -- but neither are worth much. 
 <a href="../lev/27.html#3">27:3-7</a>

<p><li>God shows his hospitality with the admonition: "The stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death." 
 <a href="../num/1.html#51">1:51</a>, <a href="../num/3.html#10">3:10</a>, <a href="../num/3.html#38">3:38</a>
 
<p><li>Two of Aaron's sons are killed by God for "offering strange fire before the Lord." 
<a href="../num/3.html#4">3:4</a>

<p><li>God tells the people to expel from camp "every leper, every one that hath an issue, and whoever is defiled by the dead."
So by God's instructions, the sick are abandoned and left to suffer and die alone.  
<a href="../num/5.html#1">5:1-4</a>

<p><li>"And when the people complained, it displeased the Lord: and the Lord heard it (He had his hearing aid on.) .... and his 
anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them."<br>
God burned the complainers alive. That'll teach them!  <a href="../num/11.html#1">11:1-2</a>

<p><li>The people begin to whine about not having any meat. So God says he'll 
give them meat, alright. He'll give them "flesh to eat," not for just a few days, but "for a whole 
month, until it come out of [their] nostrils, and it be loathsome to [them]." Yuck. 
<a href="../num/11.html#4">11:4, 19-20</a>

<p><li>"And while the flesh [of the quails] was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the Lord was kindled
against the people, and the Lord smote the people with a very great plague. "The Bible isn't too clear about what these poor
folks did to upset God so much; all it says is that they had "lusted."  <a href="../num/11.html#33">11:33</a>

<p><li> Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, the first freethought/democracy martyrs, refused to follow Moses blindly, saying 
        that everyone is holy and should be free to think for him or herself. God killed them and their 
        families for daring to challenge Moses. <a href="../num/16.html#1">16:1-35</a>

<p><li>Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment."<br>
God warns everyone to get away; he's going to kill some more people. <a href="../num/16.html#20">16:20-21</a>

<p><li>"Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me ... if the LORD make ... the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all 
that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit..."<br>
Moses tells the people that if the ground opens up and swallows the rebels and their families, then you'll know that God's on his side. 
<a href="../num/16.html#28">16:28-30</a>

<p><li>"The earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained unto 
Korah ... They ... went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them." <a href="../num/16.html#31">16:31-33</a>

<p><li>"And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that
    offered incense." <a href="../num/16.html#35">16:35</a>    

<p><li>After God killed Korah, his family, and 250 innocent bystanders, the people complained saying, "ye have killed the
people of the Lord." So God, who doesn't take kindly to criticism, sends a plague on the people. And "they that died in the
plague were 14,700."  <a href="../num/16.html#41">16:41-50</a>

<p><li>"Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a  moment."<br>
    God threatens (again) to kill everyone (but his special friends, Moses and Aaron). <a href="../num/16.html#44">16:44-45</a>
    
<p><li>"For there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun ... they that died
    in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred." <a href="../num/16.html#46">16:46-49</a>

<p><li>"And the Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and
their cities." This verse demonstrates the power of prayer: If you ask God, he will destroy entire cities for you. 
 <a href="../num/21.html#3">21:3</a>
 
<p><li>God delivers the Amorites into Moses' hands. (You're in God hands with Moses.) So Moses does the usual thing,
killing everyone "until their was none left alive."  <a href="../num/21.html#34">21:34-35</a>

<p><li>After the people "commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab," Moses has them all killed. Then God tells Moses to
hang their dead bodies up in front of him; God says that this will satisfy him.  <a href="../num/25.html#1">25:1-5</a>

<p><li>When one of the Israelite men brings home a foreign woman, "Phinehas (Aaron's grandson) sees them and throws a spear "through the man .. and the woman through her belly."
This act pleases God so much that "the plague was stayed from the children of Israel." But not before 
24,000 had died.  <a href="../num/25.html#6">25:6-9</a>

<p><li>For impaling the interracial couple, God rewards Phinehas and his sons with the everlasting 
priesthood. <a href="../num/25.html#10">25:10-13</a>

<p><li>God tells Moses how to care for his neighbors by saying: "Vex the Midianites, and smite them." 
 <a href="../num/25.html#16">25:16-17</a>

<p><li>Under God's direction, Moses' army defeats the Midianites. They kill all the adult males, but take the women and
children captive. When Moses learns that they left some live, he angrily says: "Have you saved all the women alive? Kill
every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. But all the women children,
that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves." So they went back and did as Moses (and
presumably God) instructed, killing everyone except for the virgins. In this way they got 32,000 virgins -- Wow! 
(Even God gets some of the booty -- including the virgins.) <a href="../num/31.html#1">31:1-54</a>

<p><li>"And the city shall be accursed ... and all that therein, to the Lord: only Rahab the harlot shall live." God explains that
Rahab is to be spared since she hid Joshua's spies and lied to those who were searching for them (2:4-5). But why was
everyone else killed? Some of them were probably liars too. <a href="../jos/6.html#17">6:17</a>

<p><li>Keep yourselves from "the accursed thing". Whatever that is. But be sure to save all the silver and gold for God! 
 <a href="../jos/6.html#18">6:18-19</a>

<p><li>Joshua says that those who try to rebuild Jericho will be accursed by God, and will have to

<a href="../jos/6.html#26">6:26</a>

<p><li>God tells Joshua to kill whoever took "the accursed thing."  <a href="../jos/7.html#10">7:10-12</a>

<p><li>Joshua and all the elders tear their clothes, fall on their faces, and put dust on their heads. They perform this tantrum
because the Israelites lost a battle (God was punishing them because one man (Achan) "took of the accursed thing"). 
<a href="../jos/7.html#1">7:1-13</a>

<p><li>"And Joshua ... took Achan ... and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his sheep... And all of Israel
stoned them with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones." This is because Achan "took
of the accursed thing" -- whatever that means. But why would God require that Achan's sons and daughters (and even his
animals) be stoned to death along with him? The Bible doesn't say. But it does tell us that "the Lord turned from the
fierceness of his anger" when Achan, his children, and his animals were stoned to death and their

like you, he'll send a thunderstorm your way to break your body into little pieces.  <a href="../1sam/2.html#10">2:10</a>

<p><li>God will kill those who sin against him. <a href="../1sam/2.html#25">2:25</a>

<p><li>God kills 50,070 men for looking into the ark. "And the people lamented, because the Lord had smitten many of
the people with a great slaughter." <a href="../1sam/6.html#19">6:19</a>

<p><li>"Saul ... slew the Ammorites unto the heat of the day." Then he took a little break. After all, killing is
hard work.  <a href="../1sam/11.html#11">11:11</a>

<p><li>To day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel."<br>
God saved the Israelites by slaughtering the Ammonites.  <a href="../1sam/11.html#13">11:13</a>

<p><li>God orders Saul to kill all of the Amalekites: men, women, infants, sucklings, ox, sheep, camels, and asses.
Why? Because God remembers what Amalek did hundreds of years ago.  <a href="../1sam/15.html#2">15:2-3</a>

<p><li>Saul killed everyone but Agag (the king) and the best of the animals. But still God was furious with Saul for
not killing everything as he had been told to do. He said, "it repenteth me that I have set Saul up to be king." 
 <a href="../1sam/15.html#7">15:7-26</a>
 
  <p><li>Saul is rebuked by Samuel for "doing evil in the sight of the Lord" by failing to kill all of the 
Amalekites. <a href="../1sam/15.html#18">15:18-19</a>

<p><li>Because Saul didn't kill everyone as God commanded, God changes his mind about him 
being king. <a href="../1sam/15.html#23">15:23-26</a>

<p><li> To please God, Samuel hacks Agag in pieces "before the Lord" [I bet God enjoyed that!] -- after Agag
pleads with him saying, "surely the bitterness of death has past."  <a href="../1sam/15.html#32">15:32-34</a>

<p><li>"David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter."  <a href="../1sam/19.html#8">19:8</a>

smite the Philistines."

<p><li>David asks God if he should kill some more Philistines. God says yes, and he'll even help. So David and

<p><li>"The LORD said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you: 
for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods."<br>
Note that Solomon is told to stay away from foreign women. Why? Because they have different ("strange") 
religious beliefs, and God disapproves of mixed-faith marriages. <a href="../1kg/11.html#2">11:2</a>

<p><li>His wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God."<br>
The wisest man that ever lived (<A href="../1kg/4.html#31">1 Kings 4:31</A>) was misled by his wives into worshipping other gods. 
<a href="../1kg/11.html#4">11:4</a>

To punish Jeroboam for making gold calves, God killed his son.  <a href="../1kg/14.html#17">14:17</a>

<p><li>"There were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to all the abominations...."<br>
God shows his homophobia by calling gay people "sodomites" and their sexual relations "abominations." <a href="../1kg/14.html#24">14:24</a>
 
 <p><li>Asa "did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD" by expelling homosexuals (or "sodomites", as the
good book calls them).  <a href="../1kg/15.html#12">15:12</a>

<p><li>Baasha kills "all of the house of Jeroboam" leaving none "to breath." This slaughter was done "according to the
word of the Lord."  <a href="../1kg/15.html#29">15:29</a>

<p><li>Elijah kills 450 prophets of Baal.  <a href="../1kg/18.html#22">18:22, 40</a>

<p><li>"Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy
    father, I will restore ... Then said Ahab, I will send thee away with this
    covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away."<br>
    King Ahab is merciful to king Beh-hada. God will later kill him for it. (See <a href="#42">1 Kings 20:42</a> and 
    <a href="../1kg/22.html#35">22:35</a>) <a href="../1kg/20.html#34">20:34</a>

<p><li>Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, 
therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people."<br>
The prophet tells king Ahab that he will be killed and his people punished for not killing Ben-hadad: 
"Your life shall go for his life, and your people for his people." <a href="../1kg/20.html#42">20:42</a>

<p><li>Naboth is stoned to death for blaspheming god and the king.  <a href="../1kg/21.html#13">21:13</a>

<p><li>Jehoshaphat "did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord" and "took" the homosexuals (sodomites) "out
of the land," or as the RSV says, "he exterminated" them.  <a href="../1kg/22.html#43">22:43, 46</a>

destroyed him according to the word of the Lord."  <a href="../2kg/10.html#16">10:16-17</a>

    And why did they need to kill the women and children?)  <a href="../est/8.html#9">8:9-11</a>
    
<p><li>On the day when all Jew-haters (and their families) were killed by Jews, "the Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour

<p><li>The Jews kill everyone who ever had a bad thought toward them, along with their Jew-hating families. <a href="../est/9.html#1">9:1-16</a>  

<p><li>"The Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, 
and did what they would unto those that hated them." <a href="../est/9.html#5">9:5</a>

 <a href="../is/3.html#9">3:9</a>
 
<p><li>God will kill those who despise his word and fail to follow his laws. Their

praying for. And if you do he won't listen anyway. <a href="../jer/7.html#16">7:16</a>

<p><li>God is angered by children who gather wood, fathers who make fires, 
and women that make bread for the "queen of heaven" (Mary?) and other gods. <a href="../jer/7.html#18">7:18</a>

<p><li> God will pour out his anger on both man and beast. Not even the trees will 
be spared from his wrath. And the ground itself will burn forever.  <a href="../jer/7.html#20">7:20</a>

<p><li> Don't trust anyone. Not even your neighbors, family, or friends. Those who 
believe differently than you are all liars and evil doers. <a href="../jer/9.html#4">9:4-6</a>

<p><li> "Learn not the way of the heathen." <a href="../jer/10.html#2">10:2</a>

<a href="../jer/10.html#25">10:25</a>

<p><li>Those who don't follow the Old Testament laws are cursed by God. <a href="../jer/11.html#3">11:3</a>

<p><li> Jeremiah asks God to drag away his enemies like &quot;sheep for the slaughter.&quot;&nbsp;

<p><li> If any nation does not listen to God, he "will utterly pluck up and destroy that 
nation." <a href="../jer/12.html#17">12:17</a>

<p><li>Apparently, the point of the girdle story (<a href="../jer/13.html#1">13:1-7</a>) was to say that 
worshipping other gods "is good for nothing." <a href="../jer/13.html#10">13:10</a>

<p><li> God plans to make everyone in the kingdom drunk and then "dash the fathers and the sons 
together." The merciful God of peace vows to "not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy them."  <a href="../jer/13.html#12">13:12-14</a>

<p><li>God tells Jeremiah not to pray for the people. God has decided to kill them all and he doesn't want to 
be talked out of it. <a href="../jer/14.html#11">14:11</a>

<p><li> God will destroy by famine and sword those who are misled by the prophets, as well as the prophets 
themselves.  <a href="../jer/14.html#15">14:15-16</a>

<p><li>God has it all planned out. He'll kill some with the sword, some with famine, and he'll feed the rest to the dogs and birds. 
Why will he do these terrible things? Because of something a former king did.  <a href="../jer/15.html#2">15:2-4</a>

<p><li> God will kill children if their parents worship other gods. <a href="../jer/16.html#10">16:10-11</a>

<a href="../jer/17.html#18">17:18</a>

<p><li> If you don't honor the Sabbath, God will burn you to death unquenchable fire. 
<a href="../jer/17.html#27">17:27</a>

<p><li>For worshipping "other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known," God will make 
parents eat their own children, and friends each other. Then he'll feed whoever's left to the birds. 
<a href="../jer/19.html#4">19:4, 7-9</a>

<p><li>God will break those who worship other gods as though they were made of clay, killing 
so many that there will not be enough room to bury them all. <a href="../jer/19.html#11">19:11-13</a>

<p><li>"Thus saith the LORD ... I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against
    it, because they have hardened their necks, that they might not hear my words." <a href="../jer/19.html#15">19:15</a>

Jerusalem and enslave Judah. <a href="../jer/25.html#6">25:6-11</a>

<p><li>God kills Hananiah for disagreeing with Jeremiah. <a href="../jer/28.html#16">28:16-17</a>

<p><li>God will kill those who refuse listen to his prophets. <a href="../jer/29.html#19">29:19</a>

<p><li>To punish the people for refusing to free their slaves, God over-reacts (just a tad) by 
threatening to send the sword, pestilence, and 
famine, saying he'll feed their dead bodies to the fowls and beasts of the earth. <a href="../jer/34.html#17">34:17-20</a>

<p><li>God explains why he had to bring evil on Judah: the people burned incense to other gods. <a href="../jer/44.html#2">44:2-8</a>

<p><li>God's not finished with Judah. He'll bring more evil upon them. Even those Jews that flee to Egypt will not be spared. 
God will hunt them down and kill them all with war, famine, and disease.   <a href="../jer/44.html#11">44:11-13</a>

<p><li>God is going to do some really bad things to the people because the women burned incense to the "Queen of 
Heaven" (Mary?). <a href="../jer/44.html#15">44:15-25</a>

<p><li>"I will punish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and their kings; even Pharaoh, and all them that trust in him." 
<a href="../jer/46.html#25">46:25</a>

<p><li> God will destroy everyone in Moab. Fire will burn their heads, 
and their sons and daughters will be taken captive. <a href="../jer/48.html#42">48:42-47</a>

<p><li>God will cause the daughters of the Ammonites to be burned with fire. <a href="../jer/49.html#2">49:2</a>

<p><li> God will send such marvelous plagues on Edom that everyone will hiss in astonishment. <a href="../jer/49.html#17">49:17</a>

<p><li> God plans to "bring evil upon" the people of Elam. He says he'll kill them all with a sword.  
<a href="../jer/49.html#37">49:37</a>

<p><li>"I have laid a snare for thee ... O Babylon, and thou wast not aware ... because thou hast striven against the LORD."
<a href="../jer/50.html#24">50:24</a>

<p><li>"The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord."  
<a href="../jer/50.html#25">50:25</a>

<p><li>"Destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left." <a href="../jer/50.html#26">50:26</a>

<p><li>"Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them!" <a href="../jer/50.html#27">50:27</a>

<p><li>Call together the archers against Babylon ... let none thereof escape." <a href="../jer/50.html#29">50:29</a>

<p><li>Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD."

<p><li>God's killing rules:<br>
If Ezekiel doesn't warn the wicked that God's going to kill them for being wicked, God will kill the wicked people and Ezekiel, too.<br>
If Ezekiel warns the wicked, then God will kill the wicked people (if they don't change their wicked ways), but not Ezekiel.<br>
If a good person does something wrong after God "lays a stumbling block before him," then God will kill him. "He shall die in his sin" 
and whatever good he has done will be forgotten. And Ezekiel will be killed, too, if he didn't warn the good guy beforehand. <a href="../ezek/3.html#18">3:18-20</a>

<p><li>God will decorate the land with the bones and dead bodies of those who worship a different god. 
<a href="../ezek/6.html#4">6:4-5</a>

<p><li> God makes his presence known by killing people with famine, disease, and war. <a href="../ezek/6.html#7">6:7-14</a>

<p><li> God shows Ezekiel a group of women weeping for Tammuz. Tammuz was the Sumero-Accadian god of plant life. 
    Each year after the summer solstice there was a period of ritual mourning for the loss of sunlight and 
    the decline of vegetation. God calls it an abomination. <a href="../ezek/8.html#14">8:14-15</a>

<p><li>God again vows to destroy those that dare worship something or someone other than him. 
<a href="../ezek/16.html#6">14:6-8</a>

<p><li> God threatens three times to kill all the Israelites for disobeying him, but 
  after thinking about it a bit, he decided not to. <a href="../ezek/20.html#8">20:8</a>, <a href="../ezek/20.html#13">13</a>, <a href="../ezek/20.html#21">21</a>

<p><li>"I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen ... Thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in 
derision ... thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow." <a href="../ezek/23.html#30">23:30-33</a>

<p><li> God will kill everyone that claps his hands or stamps his feet "against the land of Israel." 
    When he's done with the killing everyone will know that he is the Lord.   <a href="../ezek/25.html#6">25:6-17</a>
    
<p><li> God says he will destroy Tyrus. He plans to kill everyone, but he is especially looking 
 forward to killing all of the women. "And her daughters  which are in the field shall be slain by the sword; and 
they shall know that I am the LORD." <a href="../ezek/26.html#1">26:1-21</a>

<p><li> God says that Zidon will know that he is the Lord when he sends &quot;pestilence and blood 
into her streets.&quot; <a href="../ezek/28.html#22">28:22-23</a>

<p><li> God tells Ezekiel to prophesy against the pharaoh and against all Egypt. God says he will 
feed the Egyptians to the birds and beasts. <a href="../ezek/29.html#2">29:2-9</a>

<p><li> God will punish Egypt and her allies by sending Nebuchadrezzar to &quot;fill the land with 
the slain.&quot; Then he will make &quot;the rivers dry,&quot; sell the land to &quot;the
wicked,&quot; make &quot;the land waste,&quot; light fires, and kill all their young men with 
the sword. <a href="../ezek/30.html#4">30:4-26</a>  

<p><li>"And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I have set a fire in Egypt." (The Divine Pyromaniac) 
<a href="../ezek/30.html#8">30:8</a>, <a href="../ezek/30.html#14">30:14</a>, <a href="../ezek/30.html#16">30:16</a> 

<p><li>"Thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD." 
<a href="../ezek/31.html#18">31:18</a> 

<p><li> God will treat Pharaoh like a whale fished out of the sea.  Every bird and beast in the world 
will feed upon him.  <a href="../ezek/32.html#3">32:3-6</a>

<p><li>Pharaoh and all his multitude, along with the uncircumcised, will be killed with the sword. 
<a href="../ezek/32.html#20">32:20-32</a> 

<p><li>God tells Ezekiel about his plans for the Edomites (Seir). He's going to kill them all. That way they'll know for sure that he is the Lord. 
<a href="../ezek/35.html#2">35:2-15</a>

<p><li>Worshipping idols and other gods is "detestable." <a href="../ezek/37.html#23">37:23</a>

<p><li>God sets a fire on Magog and feeds Gog and all of his people to the birds and beasts. He did all this to let them know that he is the Lord.
 <a href="../ezek/39.html#4">39:4-7</a>
 
<p><li>"They have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger." 
<a href="../ezek/43.html#8">43:8</a>
 
<p><li>Don't bring any strangers or people with uncircumcised hearts or flesh to God's sanctuary when your offering him fat and blood. 
<a href="../ezek/44.html#7">44:7-9</a>

<p><li>No stranger or uncircumcised person may enter the sanctuary. <a href="../ezek/44.html#9">44:9</a>

<p><li> Stay away from idols or you'll bear your iniquity (i.e., God will kill you). But be sure to offer God lots of fat and blood and burnt offerings.

<p><li>Those who bear bad fruit will be cut down and burned "with unquenchable fire."  <a href="../mt/3.html#10">3:10, 12</a>

<p><li>Jesus says that most people will go to hell. <a href="../mt/7.html#13">7:13-14</a>

<p><li>Those who fail to bear "good fruit" will be "hewn down, and cast into the fire." <a href="../mt/7.html#19">7:19</a>

<p><li>"The children of the kingdom [the Jews] shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall 
be weeping and gnashing of teeth." <a href="../mt/8.html#12">8:12</a>

<p><li>Jesus tells his disciples to keep away from
the Gentiles and Samaritans, and go only to the Israelites. <a href="../mt/10.html#5">10:5-6</a>

<p><li>Cities that neither &quot;receive&quot;
the disciples nor &quot;hear&quot; their words will be destroyed by God. It will
be worse for them than for Sodom and Gomorrah. And you know what God supposedly
did to those poor folks (see <A href="../gen/19.html#24">Gen 19:24</A>).
 <a href="../mt/10.html#14">10:14-15</a>
 
 <p><li>Families will be torn apart because of Jesus (this is one of the few "prophecies" in the Bible that has actually come
true). "Brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents,
and cause them to be put to death."  <a href="../mt/10.html#21">10:21</a>

<p><li>"Whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven."

take the children's bread, and to cast it to the dogs.&quot; <a href="../mt/15.html#22">15:22-26</a>

<p><li>The ever-so-kind Jesus calls the Pharisees "hypocrites, wicked, and adulterous." Why? For asking for some 
evidence that Jesus is who he claims to be.  <a href="../mt/16.html#3">16:3-4</a>

 <p><li>"Whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder." 
Whoever falls on "this stone" (Jesus) will be broken, and whomever the stone falls on will be ground into powder.

 <p><li>In the parable of the marriage feast, the king sends his servants to gather everyone they can find, both bad and
good, to come to the wedding feast. One guest didn't have on his wedding garment, so the king tied him up and "cast him
into the outer darkness" where "there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth." 
<a href="../mt/22.html#1">22:1-14</a>

<p><li>Jesus condemns the Jews for being "the children of them which killed the prophets." 
 <a href="../mt/23.html#31">23:31</a>
 
<p><li>Jesus blames his the Jews (who were then living) for "all the righteous blood" from Abel to 
Zecharias. <a href="../mt/23.html#35">23:35</a>

 <p><li>The servant who kept and returned his master's talent was cast into the "outer darkness" where there will be
"weeping and gnashing of teeth."  <a href="../mt/25.html#30">25:30</a>

<p><li>Jesus judges the nations. <a href="../mt/25.html#31">25:31-46</a>

 <a href="../mt/25.html#41">25:41</a>

weeping and gnashing of teeth."  <a href="../lk/13.html#23">13:23-30</a>

<p><li>Jesus also believes the story about Sodom's destruction. He says, "even thus shall it be in
the day the son of man is revealed ... Remember Lot's wife." This tells us about Jesus' knowledge of science and
history, and his sense of justice.  <a href="../lk/17.html#29">17:29-32</a>

<p><li>The basic message of Christianity is "believe or be damned" and from this flows intolerance toward all
non-Christians. But, as these verses show, Christian intolerance is often directed toward believers as well. Each group
of Christians accuses the others of being  "false teachers" of "damnable heresies" who will soon be damned to hell.
