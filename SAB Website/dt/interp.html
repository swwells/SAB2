<p><li>Martin Luther used these verses (<a href="13.html#12">Deuteronomy 13:12-17</a>)to justify burning the synagogues and homes of the Jews. <br>

<p><li>Jehovah's Witnesses use this verse 
(along with <a href="../1tim/5.html#19">1 Timothy 5:19</a> and <a href="../mt/18.html#16">Matthew 18:16</a>) 
to justify their refusal to report or investigate incidents of child molestation unless two or three 
JWs have witnessed the event. If witnesses do not come forward (and they are 
discouraged from doing so since it would embarrass the organization), then the 
victim is told to be quiet about it -- or risk being disfellowshipped. <a href="19.html#15">19:15</a>

<p><li> When someone commits "a sin worthy of death" that person is "accursed of God" and should be hung on a tree. But should the accursed person be killed first by stoning and 
<i>then</i> hung on a tree or be killed <i>by hanging</i> on a tree -- that is, by crucifixion? 
<a href="http://www.theologynetwork.org/biblical-studies/going-on/the-messiah-who-was-cursed-on-the-tree.htm">I'll leave that for the Bible scholars to decide.</a> 
The important thing is to make sure you take the accursed dead body down before nightfall. Leaving dead bodies on trees all night is just nasty. Too nasty even for a 
very nasty God. <a href="21.html#22">21:22-23</a>

<p><li>The JWs believe that Jesus is "a god" who was with Jehovah 
during the creation. But how could that be if God was speaking truthfully in this verse
when he said, "there are no gods with me"?  <a href="32.html#39">32:39</a>
