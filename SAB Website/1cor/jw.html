<p><li>"Now I exhort you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you should all speak in agreement, and that there should not be 
 divisions among you, but that you may be fitly united in the same mind and in the same line of 
 thought."(NWT) The Governing Body uses this verse to control the thoughts and beliefs of Jehovah’s 
 Witnesses. They are instructed not to accept or read the religious literature of others, not to listen to 
criticism of the Watchtower Society's teachings, and to fight against independent thinking. <a href="1.html#10">1:10</a>
<p><li>"Put away from among yourselves that wicked
    person." Jehovah's Witnesses use this verses to justify disfellowshipping those who fail to follow 
    the teachings of the Governing Body. <a href="5.html#9">5:9-13</a>
<p><li>JWs are told to 
<a href="http://www.jehovahs-witness.com/forum/thread.asp?id=31199&site=3&page=4">shun disfellowshipped family and friends</a>. 
They are not to speak to them or share a 
meal with them. If a witness is caught doing so, they will be disfellowshipped as well. <a href="5.html#11">5:11</a>
<p><li><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/2114510.stm">Jehovah's Witnesses believe that they should not take another member of their 
church to court.</a> Consequently, JWs who report incidents of sex abuse are often disfellowshipped. <a href="6.html#1">6:1, 5</a>
<p><li>"For as often as you eat this loaf and drink this cup, you keep 
proclaiming the death of the Lord, until he arrives." (NWT). If Christ arrived in 1914, as the governing body 
teaches, then why do Jehovah's Witnesses continue to partake of the bread and wine? Shouldn't they have 
stopped in 1914? <a href="11.html#26">11:26</a>
<p><li>"Do not be mislead. Bad associations spoil useful habits." (NWT) This verse is used to discourage any contact with
non-JWs. ("Bad associations" refers to any contact with non-JWs.) <a href="15.html#33">15:33</a>
