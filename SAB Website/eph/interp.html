<p><li>"Paul ... to the saints to the saints which are at Ephesus"<br>
    Although Ephesians claims to have been written by Paul, most scholars think it was written 
    after his death by one of his followers. Also, the words "to the saints which are in Ephesus" does not occur in the best 
    manuscripts. <a href="1.html#1">1:1</a>

<p><li>"As I wrote afore in few words"</br>
    There was another epistle to the Ephesians that has since been lost. <a href="3.html#3">3:3-4</a>
  
<p><li><i>"Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness."</i><br>
To JWs, everything outside of the Watchtower Organization 
is controlled by Satan. This is one of the verses that the the Governing Body uses to 
condemn all holidays, civic activities, and association with non-JWs.
