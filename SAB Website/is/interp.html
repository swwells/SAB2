<p><li>"Lucifer, son of the morning."<br>
This is the only verse in the bible that mentions Lucifer. Although 
most Christians consider Lucifer to be Satan (the devil), there is little biblical justification for 
doing so. In this verse "Lucifer" refers to the king of Babylon (Nebuchadrezzar?) and Lucifer 
(the light bearer) is also called the "son of the morning" or morning star. The only other person that 
is referred to in that way is Jesus (<a href="../rev/22.html#16">Rev 22:16</a>). Does this mean that Lucifer 
is Jesus? <a href="14.html#12">14:12</a>

<p><li>"Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may
    enter in."<br>

    troops during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. <a href="26.html#2">26:2</a>
 
<p><li>God performs a &quot;marvelous work and a
wonder&quot; by destroying wisdom and understanding. The Mormons believe the "marvelous work and 
a wonder" is  <a href="../BOM/index.htm">the Book of Mormon</a> <a href="29.html#14">29:14</a>

<p><li>"Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus"<br>
    "Anointed one" means Messiah. So was king Cyrus the Messiah?<br>
    David Koresh (born Vernon Howell) chose his name after the two men in the 
	Bible who are called Messiah (or anointed 
    one) in the Bible: David and Cyrus. (The name "Koresh" is a 
    transliteration of the Hebrew  name Cyrus.) <a href="45.html#1">45:1</a>

<p><li>"My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure."<br>
    Unlike the god of the process theologians, the God of Isaiah  is in full control of his creation; 
    he has pre-ordained everything. <a href="46.html#10">46:10-11</a>

<p><li>"For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD."<br>
    Believers use these verses to justify everything cruel, nasty, and absurd in the Bible. Why did God <a href="../2kg/2.html#23">kill 42 children</a> 
    for making fun of a prophet's bald head? What was God thinking when he inspired <a href="../ezek/23.html#20">Ezekiel 23:20</a>? And what about 
    that talking donkey in <a href="../num/22.html#28">Numbers 22</a>? Well God's ways are not our ways. <a href="55.html#8">55:8-9</a>
