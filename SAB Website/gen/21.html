   And "Sarah conceived and bare Abraham a son." (God-assisted conceptions never result in daughters.) It is strange that the 100 year old Abraham 
required God's help in fathering Isaac (See <a href="../rom/4.html#19">Rom.4:19</a> and 
<a href="../heb/11.html#12">Heb.11:12</a>), yet later (<a href="../gen/25.html#1">Gen.25:1-2</a>) he marries again 
and has six more children without any help from God.<br>
<a href="../contra/abes_sons.html">How many sons did Abraham have?</a>

<p>(21:1) <i>"<b>The Lord visited Sarah ... and ... did unto Sarah as he had spoken."</b></i><b>
</b>

<p>(21:2) <b> <i>"Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age."</i>

Abraham had a feast to celebrate the day that Isaac was weaned. On that same day, apparently, Sarah saw Ishmael "mocking" his 
newly-weaned little brother. So, once again  (see <a href="16.html#5">Genesis 16:5-6</a>), Sarah tells Abraham to 
"cast out this bondwoman and her son." God commands Abraham to "hearken unto her voice." So Abraham abandons Hagar and Ishmael,
casting them out into the wilderness to die.<br>
<a href="../says_about/fathers.html">What the Bible says about fathers</a>

<p>What did Sarah see that disturbed her so much?<br>
Jonathan Kirsch suggests in The Harlot by the Side of the Road that the "play" 
between Isaac and Ishmael may have been of a sexual nature, noting that the same word is 
used to describe the behavior of Ishmael and Isaac as is used in <a href="25.html#8">Gen.26:8</a> to describe Isaac's fondling of Rebekah.

<p>(21:8) <i>"And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned."</i>

   <p>(21:9) <i>"Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking."</i> 
   
   <p>(21:10) <i>"Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son."</i>

    After the water ran out, Hagar left Ishmael alone to die. But God heard the infant crying, so he had an angel cry to Hagar 
    from heaven, telling her not to worry. God heard the child's cry and opened Hagar's eyes so she could see a well, filled with water. 
    God said he'd make Ishmael a great nation, and the child became an archer.<br>
    <a href="../contra/ishmael.html">How old was Ishmael when he was abandoned?</a>   

<p>(21:14) <i>"Abraham ... took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, 
and the child and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness."</i> 

<p>(21:15) <i>"And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs."</i>

<p>(21:16) <i>"And she went, and ... said, Let me not see the death of the child."</i>

<p>(21:17) <i>"And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, 
and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad."</i>

<p>(2:18) <i>"Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation."</i>

<p>(2:19) <i>"God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink."</i>

<p>(2:20) <i>"And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer."</i>
