<p><li>After God takes away the women's jewelry and perfume,  "discovers their secret parts," 
and makes them all bald and stinking, he'll kill their husbands.
Women will then become so desperate that "seven women will take hold of one man, saying ... let us be called by thy name, to
take away our reproach."  <a href="4.html#1">4:1</a>

<p><li>God will have no mercy on the widows and children of hypocrites. <a href="9.html#17">9:17</a>

<p><li>God will make every man kill his brother and then force him to eat "the flesh of his own arm."  
<a href="9.html#19">9:19-20</a>

<p><li>If God can find you, he will "thrust you through," smash your children "to pieces" before your eyes, and rape your wife.
He will have no mercy, but will even kill your little children.  <a href="13.html#15">13:15-18</a>

<p><li>God will slaughter children "for the iniquity of their fathers." <a href="14.html#21">14:21</a>

<p><li>The God of Peace will set brother against brother and kingdom against kingdom. Then he'll make the survivors seed the
counsel of "wizards," and subject them to a "cruel lord."  <a href="19.html#2">19:2-4</a>

<p><li>I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and
    shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land."<br>
    God will cause Sennacherib to be killed by the sword. (See <a href="37.html#38">verse 38</a> where Sennacherib is 
    killed by his own sons while praying.) <a href="37.html#7">37:7</a>
    
<p><li>"Sennacherib ... departed, and ... as he was worshipping in the
