<p><li>"Exceedingly" is one of Joseph Smith's favorite words. <a href="1.html#1">1:1</a>, <a href="1.html#20">20</a>

<p><li>"My words ... never cease."<br>
The God of the Book of Moses is a talkative God. <a href="1.html#4">1:4</a>

<p><li>"Thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten."<br>
Moses looks a lot like Jesus (I guess). <a href="1.html#6">1:6</a>

<a href="1.html#20">20</a>, <a href="1.html#22">22</a>, <a href="1.html#">24</a>, <a href="1.html#27"27></a>,
<a href="1.html#30">30</a>, <a href="1.html#36">36</a>

<p><li>"And it came to pass that it was for the space of many hours before Moses did again receive his natural strength like unto man."<br>
The Book of Moses is a waste of words. I'd quit reading if I were you. <a href="1.html#10">1:10</a>

<p><li>"There is no end ... to my words."<br>
Yeah, you already told us that. (<a href="1.html#4">1:4</a>) <a href="1.html#38">1:38</a>

<p><li>"And in a day when the children of men shall esteem my words as naught ... I will raise up another like unto thee."<br>
God is talking about Joseph Smith here. (God and Joseph Smith sound a lot alike.) <a href="1.html#41">1:41</a>

<p><li> "Show them not unto any except them that believe."<br>
Hide this book from non-Mormons. <a href="1.html#42">1:42</a>
