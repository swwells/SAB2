  After Joshua died, the Israelites wondered who was going to do their killing for them. God told them not to worry; he had 
  selected the tribe of Judah to kill the Canaanites and steal their land. The first killing was easy, since God delivered them into their hand, killing 10,000  
 Canaanites and Perizzites. After the slaughter, they capture Adonibezek and "cut off his thumbs and great toes" to pay him back for doing the same to seventy other kings. 
 (Abonibezek fed his table scraps to seventy thumbless and big toe-less kings who lived under his dinner table.)<br>

  After the Jerusalem Massacre "the children of Judah" go on a God-assisted killing spree, wiping out  
  entire kingdoms "with the edge of the sword." It's hard to say how many cities were massacred, but there were at least five: three in Hebron, along with Zephath and Bethel.
  And there would have been a lot more, too, if it weren't for those damned iron chariots (v.19). Some things are just too hard, even for God. 
  
  <p>These killings also contain an important message about Biblical Family Values. In verses 12 and 13, God's special hero (Caleb) gave his daughter to the man who could 
  kill the most people. Now <i>that</i>'s family values for you!<br>

    Caleb offers to give his daughter to whoever conquers the city of Debir. Caleb's nephew wins the contest 
and is given his cousin for a prize.
