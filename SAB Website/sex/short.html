<p><li>Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, an do ye to them as is good in your 
eyes. -- <a href='../gen/19.html#8' > 19:8</a>

<p><li>Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. And they made their father drink 
wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. Behold, I lay 
yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father .And 
they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. -- <a href='../gen/19.html#32'> 19:32-36</a>

<p><li>And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes. Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my 
son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night. -- <a href='../gen/30.html#15' > 30:15-16</a>

<p><li>And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass,  when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground. -- <a href='../gen/38.html#9' > 38:9</a>

<p><li>If a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they  shall be burnt with fire, both he and they.--<a href='../lev/20.html#14' >20:14</a>

<p><li>If a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto thou  shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their  blood shall be upon them.--<a href='../lev/20.html#16' >20:16</a>
<p><li>And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall  uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath  uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from  among their people.--<a href='../lev/20.html#18' >20:18</a>

<p><li>I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not  a maid. Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring  forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity unto the elders of the city.--<a href='../dt/22.html#14' >22:14-15</a>
<p><li>These are the tokens of my daughter's  virginity.--<a href='../dt/22.html#17' >22:18-21</a>
