number as many as the sand of the sea. <span class="a"><td bgcolor="eeeeee" rowspan="23">

<font size="-1">
In the last chapter, an angel showed Nephi all the shit his dad saw and much, much more. Nephi saw dad's magic tree, iron rod, 
large and spacious building, the exceedingly white virgin Mary, Jesus, John the Baptist, the twelve apostles -- pretty much everything 
that <strike>Joseph Smith</strike> the angel could think of at the time.

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (12:1) Now, in this chapter, the angel shows Nephi his seed. He'll have 
tons of seed, as many as the sand of the sea.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that the angel said unto me: Look, and behold thy seed, and also the seed of thy brethren. And I looked and 
beheld the land of promise; and I beheld multitudes of people, yea, even as it were in number as many as the sand of the sea."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif" > (12:2)
wars and rumours of wars -- <a href="../../mt/24.html#6">Mt.24:6</a>

<p><img src="../../images/sci1.gif" > (12:3) Nephi sees "many cities" settled by the Nephites in the 
New World. Yet no evidence of them has ever been found. <br>[Although there were Mayan cities in Mesoamerica at the time the Nephites 
supposedly occupied the Americas, the Mayan culture does not resemble that of the Nephites (or Lamanites) as described in the Book 
of Mormon.]

<p><i>"I beheld many cities, yea, even that I did not number them."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (12:3-10)

<p>(12:3) Nephi's seed will live in many cities, more cities than can be counted.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that ... I beheld many cities, yea, even that I did not number them."</i>

<p>(12:4) But bad times are coming. Mountains will disintegrate and 
cities sink and burn.

<p><i>"I saw mountains tumbling into pieces; and I saw the plains of the earth, that they were broken up; and I saw many cities 
that they were sunk; and I saw many that they were burned with fire; and I saw many that did tumble to the earth, because of the 
quaking thereof."</i>

<p>(12:6-10) Then the heavens will open up and Jesus, the Holy Ghost, and the 
apostles (with their robes made white from being washed in Jesus' blood) will come down to minster to Nephi's seed.

<p><i>"And I saw the heavens open, and the Lamb of God descending out of heaven; and he came down and showed himself unto them. 
And I also saw ... the Holy Ghost fell upon twelve others ... And these twelve ministers whom thou beholdest shall judge thy seed. And, 
behold, ... their garments are made white in his blood."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif" > (12:9) ...and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. -- 
<a href="../../rev/21.html#14">Rev.21:14</a>

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif" > (12:10) <br>
 ...and have washed their robes, and made them white in
        the blood of the Lamb. -- <a href="../../rev/7.html#14">Rev.7:14</a>
        
<p><img src="../../images/changes.gif" > (12:18) ...and Jesus Christ, which is the Lamb of God... -- 
<a href="http://carm.org/religious-movements/mormonism/1-nephi">1830 Book of Mormon</a><br>
(This was changed to avoid contradicting 
<a href="../2ne/10.html#3">2 Nephi 10:3</a>, which first reveals to Nephi the 
name of Christ.)
       

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (12:19-20) But Nephi's seed will fight his brethren's seed. And it will be 
awful to look at. Seed fighting seed everywhere. I doubt if there has been so much contending seed in a single paragraph since time began.

<p><i>"I beheld ... that the seed of my brethren did contend against my seed ... because of the pride of my seed, 
and the temptations of the devil, I beheld that the seed of my brethren 
did overpower the people of my seed. And it came to pass that I beheld ... the people of the seed of my brethren that they had 
overcome my seed; and they went forth in multitudes upon the face of the land."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" >
<img src="../../images/int.gif" border="0" >
<img src="../../images/inj1.gif" border="0" > (12:22-23) Finally, the chapter comes to a thrilling conclusion with the 
angel showing Nephi what will happen to the seed of his brethren that dwindle in unbelief: they will become a dark, loathsome, filthy, 
idle, and abominable people. (Which, according to the BoM, is the origin of the Native Americans.)

<p><i>"And the angel said unto me: Behold these shall dwindle in unbelief. And it came to pass that ... <b>after they had dwindled in 
unbelief they became a dark, and loathsome, and a filthy people, full of idleness and all manner of abominations.</b>"</i>

<tr><td><b><a name="12">12:12</b></a>   And I, Nephi, also saw many of the fourth generation who 
passed away in righteousness. 

<tr><td><b><a name="13">12:13</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that I saw the 
multitudes of the earth gathered together. 

<tr><td><b><a name="14">12:14</b></a>   And the angel said unto me: Behold thy seed, and also the 
seed of thy brethren. 

<tr><td><b><a name="15">12:15</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that I looked 
and beheld the people of my seed gathered together in multitudes against the seed of my 
brethren; and they were gathered together to battle. 

<tr><td><b><a name="16">12:16</b></a>   And the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold the fountain 
of filthy water which thy father saw; yea, even the river of which he spake; and the depths 
thereof are the depths of hell. 

<tr><td><b><a name="17">12:17</b></a>   And the mists of darkness are the temptations of the devil, 
which blindeth the eyes, and hardeneth the hearts of the children of men, and leadeth them 
away into broad roads, that they perish and are lost. 

<tr><td><b><a name="18">12:18</b></a>   And the large and spacious building, which thy father 
saw, is vain imaginations and the pride of the children of men.  And a great and a terrible 
gulf divideth them; yea, even the word of the justice of the Eternal God, 
<span class="plag">and the Messiah who is the Lamb of God</span>, of whom the Holy Ghost beareth record, from the beginning of the world 
until this time, and from this time henceforth and forever. 

<tr><td><b><a name="19">12:19</b></a>   And while the angel spake these words, <span class="a">I beheld</span> and saw 
<span class="a">that the seed of my brethren did contend against my seed</span>, according to the word of the 
angel; and <span class="a">because of the pride of my seed, and the temptations of the devil, I beheld 
that the seed of my brethren did overpower the people of my seed.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="20">12:20</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> <span class="a">that I beheld</span>, 
and saw <span class="a">the people of the seed of my brethren that they had overcome my seed; and they went 
forth in multitudes upon the face of the land.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="21">12:21</b></a>   And I saw them gathered together in multitudes; and I saw 
<span class="plag">wars and rumors of wars</span> among them; and in wars and rumors of wars I saw many generations 
pass away. 

<tr><td><b><a name="22">12:22</b></a>   <span class="a">And the angel said unto me:</span> 
<span class="i">Behold these shall </span><span class="a">dwindle in unbelief</span><span class="i">.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="23">12:23</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that I 
beheld, <span class="i">after they had </span><span class="a">dwindled in 
  unbelief</span><span class="i"> they became a dark, and loathsome, and a 
  filthy people, full of idleness and all manner of abominations.</span>
