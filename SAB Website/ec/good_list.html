<p><li>"Vanity of vanities; all is vanity." <a href="1.html#3">1:3</a>

<p><li>"The place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again."<br>
Good description of the water cycle. <a href="1.html#7">1:7</a></li></p>

<p><li>"All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing." 
<a href="1.html#8">1:8</a>

<p><li>"That which is done, is that which shall be done." <a href="1.html#9">1:9</a>

<p><li>"There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come 
after." <a href="1.html#11">1:11</a>

<p><li>"All is vanity and vexation of spirit." <a href="1.html#14">1:14</a>

<p><li>"That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered." <a href="1.html#15">1:15</a>

<p><li>"I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit." 
<a href="1.html#17">1:17</a>

<p><li>"For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow." <a href="1.html#18">1:18</a>

<p><li>"Wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness." <a href="2.html#13">2:13</a>

<p><li>"The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and ... one event happeneth to them all." 
<a href="2.html#14">2:14</a>

<p><li>"There is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come 
shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool." <a href="2.html#16">2:16</a>

<p><li>"The work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit." <a href="2.html#17">2:17</a>

<p><li>"I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me." 
<a href="2.html#18">2:18</a>

<p><li>" And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have 
laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity." <a href="2.html#19">2:19</a>

<p><li>"There is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein 
shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil." <a href="2.html#21">2:21</a>

<p><li>"For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?" 
<a href="2.html#22">2:22</a>

<p><li>"For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity." 
<a href="2.html#23">2:23</a>

<p><li>"There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour." 
<a href="2.html#24">2:24</a>

<p><li>"To everything there is a season...." Some nice poetry and a great Byrds song. ("Turn, Turn, Turn" -- written by Pete
Seeger)  <a href="3.html#1">3:1-8</a>

<p><li> "To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:" <a href="3.html#1">3:1</a>

<p><li> "A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;" <a href="3.html#2">3:2</a>

<p><li> "A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;" <a href="3.html#3">3:3</a>

<p><li> "A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;" <a href="3.html#4">3:4</a>

<p><li> "A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;" <a href="3.html#5">3:5</a>

<p><li> "A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;" <a href="3.html#6">3:6</a>

<p><li> "A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;" <a href="3.html#7">3:7</a>

<p><li> "A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace." <a href="3.html#8">3:8</a>

<p><li>"There is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life." <a href="3.html#12">3:12</a>

<p><li> "Every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour" <a href="3.html#13">3:13</a>

<p><li> "That which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; 
yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity." <a href="3.html#19">3:19</a>

<p><li> "All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again." <a href="3.html#20">3:20</a>

<p><li> "Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?" <a href="3.html#21">3:21</a>

<p><li> "There is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works." <a href="3.html#22">3:22</a>

 <p><li>"Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit." <a href="4.html#6">4:6</a>
 
 <p><li>"Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour." <a href="4.html#9">4:9</a>
 
  <p><li>"For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another 
  to help him up." <a href="4.html#10">4:10</a>

 <p><li>"Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?" <a href="4.html#11">4:11</a>

 <p><li>"And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken." <a href="4.html#12">4:12</a>
 
<p><li>"Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king." <a href="4.html#13">4:13</a>

<p><li> "A fool's voice is known by multitude of words."  <a href="5.html#3">5:3</a>

<p><li>"He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity." 
 <a href="5.html#10">5:10</a>

<p><li>As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, 
which he may carry away in his hand."  <a href="5.html#15">5:15</a>

<p><li>"It is good and comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun
all the days of his life."  <a href="5.html#18">5:18</a>

<p><li>"If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years ... and his soul be not filled with good  ... 
    an untimely birth is better than he." <a href="6.html#3">6:3</a>
    
<p><li>"For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness." <a href="6.html#4">6:4</a>

<p><li>"Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he seen no good: do not all go to one place?" <a href="6.html#6">6:6</a>

<p><li>"For who knoweth what is good for man in this life ... who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?"  
<a href="6.html#12">6:12</a>

<p><li>"A good name is better than precious ointment." <a href="7.html#1">7:1</a>

<p><li>"It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools."  <a href="7.html#5">7:5</a>

<p><li>"The patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit."  <a href="7.html#8">7:8</a>

<p><li>"Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools."  <a href="7.html#9">7:9</a>

<p><li>"Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this." 
<a href="7.html#10">7:10</a>

<p><li>"For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it." 
<a href="7.html#12">7:12</a>

<p><li>Don't pay attention to everything people say. <a href="7.html#21">7:21</a>

<p><li>"I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason of things." <a href="7.html#25">7:25</a>
 
<p><li>"A man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry."  <a href="8.html#15">8:15</a>

<p><li>"All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked ... they go to the dead." 
<a href="9.html#2">9:2-3</a>

<p><li>"For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion." <a href="9.html#4">9:4</a>

<p><li>"For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of 
them is forgotten." <a href="9.html#5">9:5</a>

<p><li>"Their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing 
that is done under the sun." <a href="9.html#6">9:6</a>

<p><li>"Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart."  <a href="9.html#7">9:7</a>

<p><li>"Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest."  <a href="9.html#9">9:9</a>

<p><li>"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, 
in the grave, whither thou goest." <a href="9.html#10">9:10</a>

<p><li> " I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, 
nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all." 
<a href="9.html#11">9:11</a>

<p><li>"For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so 
are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them." <a href="9.html#12">9:12</a>

<p><li>"Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard."  
<a href="9.html#16">9:16</a>

<p><li>"The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools." <a href="9.html#17">9:17</a>

<p><li>"Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth much good." <a href="9.html#18">9:18</a>

<p><li>"Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in 
reputation for wisdom and honour." <a href="10.html#1">10:1</a>

<p><li> "Wisdom is profitable to direct."  <a href="10.html#10">10:10</a>

<p><li>"The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself."  <a href="10.html#12">10:12</a>

<p><li>"A fool also is full of words."  <a href="10.html#14">10:14</a>

<p><li>"Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun." <a href="11.html#7">11:7</a>

<p><li>"If a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. 
All that cometh is vanity." <a href="11.html#8">11:8</a>

<p><li>"Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, 
and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes." <a href="11.html#9">11:9</a>
