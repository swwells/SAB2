<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>3:1</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Lamanites did not come to battle again until ten years more had passed away.  
And behold, I had employed my people, the Nephites, in preparing their lands and their arms against the time of battle.

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32"> 
<a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a> <br>
[3:1, 2, 4, 5, 7(2), 11, 16]
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>3:2</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Lord did say unto me: Cry unto this people -- Repent ye, and come unto me, and be 
ye baptized, and build up again my church, and ye shall be spared. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>3:3</b> And I did cry unto this people, but it 
was in vain; and they did not realize that it was the Lord that had spared them, and granted unto them a chance for 
repentance.  And behold they did harden their hearts against the Lord their God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>3:4</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that after this tenth year had passed away, making, in the whole, three hundred and 
sixty years from the coming of Christ, the king of the Lamanites sent an epistle unto me, which gave unto me to know that 
they were preparing to come again to battle against us. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>3:5</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that I did cause my people that they should gather themselves together at the land 
Desolation, to a city which was in the borders, by the narrow pass which led into the land southward. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>3:6</b>   And there we did place our armies, that we might stop the armies of the Lamanites, that they might not get 
possession of any of our lands; therefore we did fortify against them with all our force. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>3:7</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that in the three hundred and sixty and first year the Lamanites did come down to the 
city of Desolation to battle against us; <span class="a">and it came to pass</span> that in that year we did beat them, insomuch that they did 
return to their own lands again. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>3:8</b>   And in the three hundred and sixty and second year they did come down again to battle.  And we did beat them 
again, and did slay a great number of them, and their dead were cast into the sea. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>3:9</b>   And now, because of this great thing which my people, the Nephites, had done, they began to boast in their 
own strength, and began to swear before the heavens that they would avenge themselves of the blood of their brethren who had 
been slain by their enemies. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>3:10</b>   And they did swear by the heavens, and also by the throne of God, that they would go up to battle against 
their enemies, and would cut them off from the face of the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>3:11</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that I, Mormon, did utterly refuse from this time forth to be a commander and a leader 
of this people, because of their wickedness and abomination. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>3:12</b>   Behold, I had led them, notwithstanding their wickedness I had led them many times to battle, and had 
loved them, according to the love of God which was in me, with all my heart; and my soul had been poured out in prayer unto 
my God all the day long for them; nevertheless, it was without faith, because of the hardness of their hearts. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>3:13</b>   And thrice have I delivered them out of the hands of their enemies, and they have repented not of their 
sins. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>3:14</b>   And when they had sworn by all that had been forbidden them by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, that they 
would go up unto their enemies to battle, and avenge themselves of the blood of their brethren, behold the voice of the Lord 
came unto me saying: <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>3:15</b> <span class="plag">Vengeance is mine, and I will repay</span>; and because this people repented not after I had delivered them, 
behold, they shall be cut off from the face of the earth. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">

Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith theLord. -- <a href="../../rom/12.html#19">Romans 12:19</a>

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>3:16</b> <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that I utterly refused to go up against mine enemies; and I did even as the Lord had 
commanded me; and I did stand as an idle witness to manifest unto the world the things which I saw and heard, according to 
the manifestations of the Spirit which had testified of things to come. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>3:17</b>   Therefore I write unto you, Gentiles, and also unto you, house of Israel, when the work shall commence, 
that ye shall be about to prepare to return to the land of your inheritance; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>3:18</b>   Yea, behold, I write unto all the ends of the earth; yea, unto you, twelve tribes of Israel, who shall be 
judged according to your works by the twelve whom Jesus chose to be his disciples in the land of Jerusalem. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>3:19</b>   And I write also unto the remnant of this people, who shall also be judged by the twelve whom Jesus chose 
in this land; and they shall be judged by the other twelve whom Jesus chose in the land of Jerusalem. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>3:20</b>   And these things doth the Spirit manifest unto me; therefore I write unto you all.  And for this cause I 
write unto you, that ye may know that<span class="plag"> ye must all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ</span>, yea, every soul who belongs to 
the whole human family of Adam; <span class="plag">and ye must stand to be judged of your works, whether they be good or evil;
  </span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

 <font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/plag.gif" width="32" height="32"> (3:20, 22)<br>
For we must all appear
        before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body,
        according to that he hath done, whether  be good or bad. -- <a href="../../2cor/5.html#10">2 Cor.5:10</a>

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>3:21</b>   And also that ye may believe the gospel of Jesus Christ, which ye shall have among you; and also that the 
Jews, the covenant people of the Lord, shall have other witness besides him whom they saw and heard, that Jesus, whom they 
slew, was the very Christ and the very God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>3:22</b>   And I would that I could persuade all ye ends of the earth to repent and prepare to 
  <span class="plag">stand before the
