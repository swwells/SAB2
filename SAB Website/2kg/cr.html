<p><li>Ahaziah was sick and sent messengers to Baalzebub to ask if he would recover. God was jealous of the

 <a href="1.html#2">1:2-8</a>
 
<p><li>Elijah shows that he is "a man of God" by burning 102 men to death. He

and mar every good piece of land with stones." <a href="3.html#19">3:19-25</a>

<p><li>In a desperate attempt to halt the slaughter of his people by the Israelites, the king of Moab sacrifices his oldest
son as a burnt offering.  And it seems to have worked! <a href="3.html#27">3:27</a>

<p><li>Elisha not only can cure leprosy, he can also dish it out. Here he makes his servant (Gehazi) and all his
descendants lepers forever. <a href="5.html#27">5:27</a>

<p><li>"Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. 
And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha. <a href="6.html#18">6:18</a>

<p><li>"So we boiled my son, and did eat him." Women killed, boiled and ate their own

<p><li>"For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall." 
<a href="9.html#8">9:8</a>

<p><li>"I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam ... Baasha."<br>
    God will kill Ahab's family just like he did the families of 
    <a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2012/07/jeroboams-family.html" >Jeroboam</a> and 
    <a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2010/02/gods-80th-killing-god-kills-another.html" >Baasha</a>.

<p><li>God has Jezebel thrown off a wall. Her blood is sprinkled on the wall and on the horses, by which she is
trampled. Her body is eaten by dogs and all that remains of it is her hands, feet, and skull. God says that she "shall be
as dung upon the face of the field."  <a href="9.html#33">9:33-37</a>

<p><li>Jehu meets with 42 brothers of Ahaziah, and then he murders them. <a href="../2chr/22.html#7">2 Chronicles 22:7</a> says 
that his killing was "of God." <a href="10.html#13">10:13-14</a>

<p><li>Jehu shows off his zeal for the Lord by murdering "all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had
destroyed him according to the word of the Lord."  <a href="10.html#16">10:16-17</a>

<p><li>God is greatly pleased with all of Jehu's killings, saying "because thou hast done well in executing that which
is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart [Jehu murdered
them all], thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel."  <a href="10.html#30">10:30</a>

  <a href="11.html#15">11:15-16</a>

 <a href="15.html#5">15:5</a>

    shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land."<br>
    God will cause Sennacherib to be killed by the sword. (See <a href="19.html#37">verse 37</a> where Sennacherib is 
    killed by his own sons while praying.) <a href="19.html#7">19:7</a>

<p><li>An "angel of the Lord" kills 185,000 men while they sleep. "And when they arose early in the morning, behold,
they were all dead corpses." I guess they all woke up and said, "Shucks, I'm dead."  <a href="19.html#35">19:35</a>

<p><li>"Sennacherib ... departed ... And ... as he was worshipping in the 
     house of Nisroch his  god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword."<br>
     God made the sons murder their father. (See <a href="19.html#7">verse 7</a>.) <a href="19.html#36">19:36-37</a>

<p><li>Josiah, apparently with God's approval, kills "all the priests of the high places" and sacrifices them to God on
their altars. Note that this is a guy who "did what was right in the eyes of the Lord" 
(<a href="22.html#2">2 Kings 22:2</a>).  <a href="23.html#20">23:20</a>

<p><li>Even though Josiah did all that God asked of him, God still punished him and all Jerusalem for the acts of his
grandfather.  <a href="23.html#26">23:26</a>
