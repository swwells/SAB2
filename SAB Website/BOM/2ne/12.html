<p>(12:1) The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem. 

<br>(12:2) And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the
    LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be
    exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. -- <a href="../../is/2.html#1">Isaiah 2:1-2</a>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" >
<a href="aictp_list.html">It shall came to pass</a> (12:2, 11)

<p>(12:3) And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the
    mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us
    of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth
    the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. 

<br>(12:4) And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords
    into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift
    up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. 
    
    <br>(12:5) O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the LORD. -- <a href="../../is/2.html#5">Isaiah 2:5</a>
    
    <br>(12:6) Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they
    be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and
    they please themselves in the children of strangers. 

<br>(12:7) Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of
    their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end
    of their chariots: 

<br>(12:8) Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own
    hands, that which their own fingers have made: 

<br>(12:9) And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself:
    therefore forgive them not. 

<br>(12:10) Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the LORD, and
    for the glory of his majesty. 

<p>(12:11) The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall
    be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day. 

<p>(12:12) For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and
    lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low: 

<p>(12:13) And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and upon
    all the oaks of Bashan, 

<p>(12:14) And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted
    up, 
    
<p>(12:15) And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall, 

<p>(12:16) And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures. 

<p>(12:17) And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men
    shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day. 

<p>(12:18) And the idols he shall utterly abolish. 

<p>(12:19) And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the
    earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he
    ariseth to shake terribly the earth. 

<p>(12:20) In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold,
    which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the
    bats; 

<p>(12:21) To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks,
    for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to
    shake terribly the earth. 

<p>(12:22) Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to
    be accounted of ? -- <a href="../../is/2.html#3">Isaiah 2:3-22</a>

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>12:2</b> <span class="plag">And</span> <span class="a">it shall come to pass</span>
  <span class="plag">in the last days, when the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established 
in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills, and all nations shall flow unto it.
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>12:3</b> <span class="plag">And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house 
of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for out of Zion shall go forth 
the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>12:4</b> <span class="plag">And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and
  they shall beat their swords 
into plow-shares, and their spears into pruning-hooks -- nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall 
they learn war any more.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>12:5</b> <span class="plag">O house of Jacob, come ye and let us walk in the light of the Lord;</span> yea, come, for ye have all gone 
astray, every one to his wicked ways.

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>12:6</b><span class="plag">   Therefore, O Lord, thou hast forsaken thy people, the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from 
the east, and hearken unto soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>12:7</b> <span class="plag">Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is 
also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>12:8</b> <span class="plag">Their land is also full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers 
have made. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>12:9</b> <span class="plag">And the mean man boweth not down, and the great man humbleth himself not, therefore, forgive him not.
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>12:10</b>   O ye wicked ones, <span class="plag">enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for the fear of the Lord and the 
glory of his majesty</span> shall smite thee. 

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>12:11</b>   And <span class="a">it shall come to pass</span> that 
  <span class="plag">the lofty looks of man shall 
be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>12:12</b> <span class="plag">For the day of the Lord of Hosts soon cometh upon all nations, yea, upon every one; yea, upon the proud 
and lofty, and upon every one who is lifted up, and he shall be brought low.
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>12:13</b>   Yea, and the day of the Lord shall come 
  <span class="plag">upon all the cedars of Lebanon, for they are high and lifted 
up; and upon all the oaks of Bashan; </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>12:14</b> <span class="plag">And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills, and upon all the nations which are lifted up</span>, 
and upon every people; 

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>12:15</b> <span class="plag">And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall;
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>12:16</b> <span class="plag">And upon all the ships of the sea, and upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant 
pictures. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>12:17</b> <span class="plag">And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low; and the 
Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>12:18</b> <span class="plag">And the idols he shall utterly abolish.
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>12:19</b> <span class="plag">And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for the fear of the 
Lord shall come upon them and the glory of his majesty shall smite them, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>12:20</b> <span class="plag">In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which he hath made for himself 
to worship, to the moles and to the bats; </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>12:21</b> <span class="plag">To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for the fear of the Lord 
shall come upon them and the majesty of his glory shall smite them, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.
  </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>12:22</b> <span class="plag">Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for wherein is he to be accounted of?
