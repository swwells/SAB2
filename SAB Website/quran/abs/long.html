<b>Absurdity in the Quran</b>

<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../2/abs.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p><li>"Alif. Lam. Mim."<br>
Many surahs start with three Arabic letters. No one knows why. But I have a theory. The mysterious letters (Alif. Lam. Mim.) 
are the Quranic equivalent of WTF. <a href="../2/index.htm#1">2:1</a>

<p><li>"This is the Scripture whereof there is no doubt, a guidance unto those who  ward off (evil)."</i>
There is no doubt about this or any other "Scripture". It is false. It wasn't revealed by God and it won't "ward off evil."
 <a href="../2/index.htm#2">2:2</a>
 
 <p><li>Those who believe in the unseen things revealed by Muhammad and who are absolutely certain they will survive their own 
 death are the successful people. You know, the Muslims.  <a href="../2/index.htm#3">2:3-5</a>
 
 <p><li>"Shall we believe as the foolish believe?"<br>
According to the Quran, the answer is, yes. To be truly wise you must believe whatever the foolish believe. <a href="../2/index.htm#13">2:13</a>

<p><li>Allah especially dislikes people who pretend to believe when they're around Muslims, and then disbelieve when they hang out with devils. 
<a href="../2/index.htm#14">2:14</a>

<p><li>"If Allah willed, He could destroy their hearing and their sight. Lo! Allah is able to do all things." <a href="../2/index.htm#20">2:20</a>

<p><li>"And if ye are in doubt ... then produce a surah of the like thereof."<br>
If you doubt that the truth of the Quran, then try making some stuff up and see how it compares. (Whatever you come up with will be better than the 
Quran.) <a href="../2/index.htm#23">2:23</a>

<p><li>Allah created seven heavens. <a href="../2/index.htm#29">2:29</a>

<p><li>And He taught Adam all the names."<br>
Allah taught Adam all the names of the plants and animals, which must have taken a while since there are 1.7 million species that are known 
today, with probably another 10 million or so that are yet to be discovered. And this only includes those that are alive today. If extinct species 
are included (~99%), then Allah must have taught Adam a billion or so names. <a href="../2/index.htm#31">2:31a</a>

<p><li>Then Allah showed all the animals to the angels, challenging them to guess their names (if they are truthful). 
<a href="../2/index.htm#31">2:31b</a>

<p><li>But the angels weren't truthful enough to guess correctly.  <a href="../2/index.htm#32">2:32</a>

<p><li>Then Allah tells Adam to tell the angels the animals' names. So Adam tells them and says, "I know something you 
guys don't! Neener-Neener-Neener!" <a href="../2/index.htm#33">2:33</a>

<p><li>Allah commands the angels to worship Adam. They all do, except for Iblis, who becomes a disbeliever. <a href="../2/index.htm#34">2:34</a> 

<p><li>After the people worshipped a calf, Moses told them to kill themselves. That, he said, would be best for them. 
<a href="../2/index.htm#54">2:54</a>

<p><li>Allah struck Moses with lightning and then revived him just so that Moses would thank him for it!
 <a href="../2/index.htm#55">2:55-56</a>
 
 <p><li>As you read the Quran you'll notice that many of the Bible's stupidest stories are made even 
stupider in the Quran. Take <a href="../../ex/17.html#1">Exodus 17:1-6</a> for example. In the Bible, Moses strikes a rock and water 
comes out for the Israelites to drink. In the Quran, the same thing happens but there are twelve springs that come out of the rock, 
one for each tribe of Israel. <a href="../2/index.htm#60">2:60</a>
 
<p><li>Allah turned Sabbath-breaking Jews into apes to be despised and hated. All modern Jews are descendants of apes 
(or all modern apes are descendants of Sabbath-breaking Jews). <a href="../2/index.htm#65">2:65-66</a>

<p><li>"Allah told the Jews to sacrifice a bright yellow cow. <a href="../2/index.htm#67">2:67-69</a>

<p><li>But they weren't sure what cow to kill. All cows pretty much look alike to Jews. <a href="../2/index.htm#67">2:67-69</a>

<p><li>Somehow they worked it all out, though, and killed a yellow cow. <a href="../2/index.htm#71">2:71</a>

<p><li>A man was murdered about the same time that the yellow cow was killed. Nobody knew who the murderer was. So Allah told the 
people to smite the dead man with a piece of the dead cow. When they did that, the dead man came to life and told everyone who had 
murdered him. (I hope I got that right.)<a href="../2/index.htm#72">2:72-3</a> 

<p><li>There are rocks which fall down for the fear of Allah."<br>
Are there rocks that fall down laughing at the stupid things Allah says in the Quran? <a href="../2/index.htm#74">2:74</a>

<p><li>"Little is that which they believe."<br>
At least Allah got that right. There is little in the Quran that is worthy of belief. <a href="../2/index.htm#88">2:88</a>

<p><li>Pay no attention to the know-nothings that ask Allah for a sign. (Or ask him to say something good, kind, decent, 
or reasonable in the Quran.) <a href="../2/index.htm#118">2:118a</a>

<p><li>Their hearts are all alike (they suck). Allah's revelations are clear to those that already believe that Allah's revelations are clear.
<a href="../2/index.htm#118">2:118b</a>

<p><li>"We take our colour from Allah, and who is better than Allah at colouring."<br>
Muslims were colored by God. "Who is better than Allah at coloring?"<br>
I give up. Who <i>is</i> better at coloring than Allah? <a href="../2/index.htm#138">2:138</a>

<p><li>Allah guides whoever the hell he wants on a straight path. And once in a while he changes the direction of the path for no 
reason whatsoever. <a href="../2/index.htm#142">2:142</a>

<p><li>Allah changes the holy direction. Originally Muslims prayed toward Jerusalem. But then, for no apparent reason, Allah told 
Muhammad to start praying toward a black cube-shaped building in Mecca (the Kaaba). The Kaaba, according to Islamic tradition,
 was the first building on earth. Built by Adam and re-built later by Abraham and Ishmael, the Kaaba is the direction that all 
 Muslims pray toward five times day, and is the holy site that all Muslims are supposed to visit once in their lifetime. 
 <a href="../2/index.htm#143">2:143-4</a>
 
<p><li>"Those who disbelieve [are] Deaf, dumb, blind, therefore they have no sense." <a href="../2/index.htm#171">2:171</a>

<p><li>"There is life for you in retaliation ... that ye may ward off (evil)."<br>
There is life for you in Allah's magic retaliation. It helps to ward off evil. (It works like a rabbit's foot or something.) 
<a href="../2/index.htm#179">2:179</a>

<p><li>"Beautified is the life of the world for those who disbelieve; 
they make a jest of the believers."<br>
Yes life is beautiful to us unbelievers and we like to laugh at believers! <a href="../2/index.htm#212">2:212</a>

<p><li>Drinking and gambling are sinful, but useful. Allah isn't sure, but he figures their sinfulness is probably greater than their 
usefulness. Just try not to spend too much on either. <a href="../2/index.htm#219">2:219a</a>

<p><li>If you're wondering how much is too much to spend on drinking and gambling, Allah has the answer for you. Only drink or gamble 
away what is superfluous. Allah is Mighty, Wise, Helpful. <a href="../2/index.htm#219">2:219b</a>

<p><li>Next Allah gets down to the really important things in life. Things we all wonder about from time to time. Like should I marry a 
few idolatresses? Is an Islamic concubine better than a really hot Christian woman? Should I refuse to give my daughter to a Jewish man 
until he becomes a Muslim? And who should I invite to the Fire anyway? <a href="../2/index.htm#221">2:221</a> 

<p><li>After your divorced wives have reached the end of their 3 month waiting period, you can take them or leave them. Just don't make 
Allah a laughing-stock. <a href="../2/index.htm#231">2:231</a> 

<p><li>When a man dies, his wives can't have sex for four months and ten days. After that, if they're not pregnant, it's no sin for 
the dead man if his wives have sex again. <a href="../2/index.htm#234">2:234</a>

<p><li>Allah told thousands of soldiers to die. Then after they died, Allah brought them back to life. <a href="../2/index.htm#243">2:243</a>

<p><li>Allah asks for a loan, promising to pay us back with interest. Allah straightens and enlarges whatever is bent or small. 
<a href="../2/index.htm#245">2:245</a>

<p><li>Then Allah starts with the Bible stories. And, as usual, he gets them all wrong. First he has angels carrying the ark. 
<a href="../2/index.htm#247">2:247</a>

<p><li>Allah confuses Saul with Gideon when telling the stupid dog-lapping story of <a href="../../jg/7.html#5">Judges 7:5-7</a>. 
<a href="../2/index.htm#249">2:249</a>

<p><li>Abraham argues with a disbeliever by saying, "God makes the sun rise in the east. Make it rise in the west." Which totally 
abashed the disbeliever. But the disbeliever should have said, "I make the sun rise in the east. Ask Allah to make it rise in the 
west." That would have abashed Abraham and Allah. <a href="../2/index.htm#258">2:258</a>

<p><li>Allah makes a man "die" for 100 years, and then brings him back to life.
 <a href="../2/index.htm#259">2:259</a>
 
<p><li>To show how he gives life to the dead, Allah tells Abraham to cut up the 
bodies of four birds, scatter their remains on four hills, and then call to them. Allah says 
that the dead birds will come quickly to Abraham. <a href="../2/index.htm#260">2:260</a>

 <p><li>Some scriptures are allegorical and some are not. No one understands the allegorical stuff except for Allah. 
 <a href="../3/index.htm#7">3:7</a> 

 <p><li>Muslims are the best people. Most Non-muslims are "evil-livers." <a href="../3/index.htm#110">3:110</a> 
 
 <p><li>Allah tells us about a battle between the good guys (the Muslims) and the bad guys (the non-Muslims). One side saw "clearly, 
 with their very eyes" that the other side had twice as many soldiers. End of story. "Lo! herein verily is a lesson for those who 
 have eyes." (I guess I don't have eyes.) <a href="../3/index.htm#13">3:13</a> 
 
 <p><li>"If ye love Allah, follow me; Allah will  love you and forgive you your sins."</i><br>
	Follow Muhammad and Allah will love your and forgive your sins. Otherwise.... <a href="../3/index.htm#31">3:31</a>

 
 <p><li>"Obey Allah and the messenger." But mostly the Messenger (Muhammad). <a href="../3/index.htm#32">3:32</a>
 
 <p><li>Here's a fun story about Allah, Jesus, and magic clay birds.<br>
 "Lo! I [Allah] fashion for you [Jesus] out of clay the likeness of a bird, and I breathe into it and it is a bird, by Allah's leave. "
  <a href="../3/index.htm#49">3:49</a> 
  
   <p><li>"Allah is the best of schemers." <a href="../3/index.htm#54">3:54</a> 
   
   <p><li>"Why then argue ye concerning that whereof ye have no knowledge?"<br>
  Don't argue about things that you know nothing about. <a href="../3/index.htm#66">3:66</a> 
  
  <p><li>Why does Allah like Muslims so much? Because they are the best people on earth, they behave themselves, forbid indecency, 
 and believe in Allah. Allah loves people who believe in him. (Most Non-muslims are "evil-livers.") <a href="../3/index.htm#110">3:110</a> 
 
 <p>"Obey Allah and obey the messenger." <a href="../3/index.htm#132">3:132</a>

<p><li>"Ye will overcome them if ye are (indeed) believers."<br>
	(Believers always defeat unbelievers.) <a href="../3/index.htm#139">3:139</a> 
	
<p><li>Those who retreat while fighting in a holy war are inspired by Satan. <a href="../3/index.htm#155">3:155</a>	

 <p><li>"Think not of those, who are slain in the way of Allah, as dead." <a href="../3/index.htm#169">3:169-171</a> 
 


<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="11524" endspan --><!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../4/abs.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p><li>Inheritance laws: None of this makes sense to me, 
but <a href="http://www.answering-islam.org/Quran/Contra/i001.html">here's a link</a> that explains it all for you. 
<a href="../4/index.htm#11">4:11-12</a>

<p><li>"We shall cast him into Fire, and that is ever easy for Allah." <a href="../4/index.htm#30">4:30</a>

<p><li>Be kind to the slaves "whom your right hands possess." But, of course, if a kind person would set slaves free and wouldn't 
have them in the first place. <a href="../4/index.htm#36">4:36</a>

<p><li>Don't make Satan your imaginary friend. Choose Allah instead! <a href="../4/index.htm#38">4:38</a>

<p><li>If you get dirty (by touching a woman or something), and can't find any clean water 
around at prayer time, you can clean up by rubbing your face and hands in some clean 
dirt. <a href="../4/index.htm#43">4:43</a>

<p><li>Christians and Jews must believe what Allah has revealed to Muhammad or Allah will disfigure their faces or
turn them into apes, as he did the Sabbath-breakers. (See 
<a href="../2/index.htm#65">2:65-66</a>) <a href="../4/index.htm#47">4:47</a>

<p><li>Virgins (and plenteous shade) await those who enter paradise. <a href="../4/index.htm#57">4:57</a>

<p><li>"We sent no messenger save that he should be obeyed by Allah's leave."</i> (Obey Muhammad.) <a href="../4/index.htm#64">4:64</a>

<p><li>Don't worry about dying in battle. Remember the shade and the pure companions. Allah wouldn't hurt the down on a date-stone. 
<a href="../4/index.htm#77">4:77</a>

<p><li> If something good happens to you, it is because of Allah. If something bad happens, it's your own damn fault. Heads, 
Allah wins; tails, you lose. <a href="../4/index.htm#78">4:78-79</a>

<p><li>"Whoso obeyeth the messenger hath obeyed Allah, and whoso turneth away: We have not sent thee as a warder over them." 
<a href="../4/index.htm#80">4:80</a>

<p><li>"Will they not then ponder on the Qur'an? If it had been from other than Allah they would have found therein much incongruity."<br>
If the Quran was not from Allah its critics would find some mistakes in it.(The Quran filled with mistakes. It is a silly, error-filled book. But even if 
the Quran didn't contain a single error, it would not prove that it was from Allah.) <a href="../4/index.htm#82">4:82</a>

<p><li>"If it had not been for the grace of Allah upon you and His mercy ye would have followed Satan, save a few (of you)."<br>
Most of us would be followers of Satan if it wasn't for Allah. <a href="../4/index.htm#83">4:83</a>

<p><li>Whoever participates in a good cause, will be rewarded.
Whoever participates in an evil cause, will bear the consequences thereof. (It's not true, but it's a nice thought.) 
<a href="../4/index.htm#85">4:85</a>

<p><li>If someone says Hi to you say Hi (or Howdy) back to them. <a href="../4/index.htm#86">4:86</a>

<p><li>"Who enjoineth almsgiving and kindness and peace-making ... We shall bestow ... a vast reward."<br>
It is good to help the poor and make peace. (But the part about Allah giving you a big reward for doing so is a big lie.) 
<a href="../4/index.htm#114">4:114</a>

<p><li>Don't cut cattle's ears and, thereby, change Allah's creation. 
(<a href="http://www.muslimconverts.com/cosmetics/plucking_eyebrows.htm">This is interpreted</a> to mean that Muslim men must not shave 
their beards, and Muslim women must not pluck their eyebrows.) Allah commands non-Muslims 
to shave beards and pluck eyebrows so he can have an excuse to burn them in hell after they die.
 <a href="../4/index.htm#119">4:119-121</a>
 
 <p><li>Allah will not allow disbelievers to succeed against believers. 
<a href="../4/index.htm#141">4:141</a>

<p><li>What not to eat: roadkill, blood, pigs, animals sacrificed to gods other than Allah, animals that were strangled, beat to death, 
jumped of a cliff, fell from the sky, or were killed by other animals. <a href="../5/index.htm#3">5:3</a>

<p><li>"I perfected your religion for you ... and have chosen for you as religion al-Islam." <a href="../5/index.htm#3">5:3</a>

<p><li>When it's time to pray and you have just used the toilet or touched 
a woman, be sure to wash up. If you can't find any water, just rub some dirt on yourself.
 <a href="../5/index.htm#6">5:6</a>
 
<p><li>Jesus has a conversation with a godly unclean spirit named "Legion." <a href="../5/index.htm#8">5:8-10</a> 

<p><li>"O People of the Scripture! Now hath Our messenger come unto you,  expounding unto you much of that which ye used to hide in the Scripture."<br>
Muhammad, who was illiterate and who had never read the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, offers to explain the scriptures to Christians and Jews, who he claims hide and distort the true meaning of their scriptures.
 <a href="../5/index.htm#15">5:8-15</a>
 
<p><li>Christians are disbelievers for believing in the divinity of Christ. <a href="../5/index.htm#17">5:17</a> 

<p><li>The Quran repeats the silly story about Cain and Abel (though they are unnamed in the Quran).  <a href="../5/index.htm#27">5:27-31</a> 

<p><li>"Allah sent a raven scratching up the ground, to show him how to hide  his brother's naked corpse." <a href="../5/index.htm#31">5:31</a> 
 
<p><li>Allah has turned some Christians and Jews into apes and swine. <a href="../5/index.htm#60">5:60</a> 

<p><li>Allah warns believers not to ask to many questions. (Honest answers will cause them to lose their faith.) <a href="../5/index.htm#101">5:101</a>

<p><li>Jesus made a bird out of clay that flew away when he blew on it. <a href="../5/index.htm#110">5:110</a> 

<p><li>The disciples of Jesus were muslims! <a href="../5/index.htm#111">5:111</a>

<p><li>Jesus' disciples ask Jesus to send a table of food down from heaven. And he delivers! <a href="../5/index.htm#112">5:112-114</a>

<p><li>After agreeing to send down a table of food from heaven, Jesus warns his disciples that will catch holy hell if they ever stop believing. 
<a href="../5/index.htm#114">5:115</a>

<p><li>The Christian Trinity is the Father, Mother, and Son. <a href="../5/index.htm#116">5:116</a>

<p><li>"See they not how many a generation We destroyed?"<br>
How could they (or anyone else who wasn't there) see Allah destroy previous generations?  <a href="../6/index.htm#6">6:6</a> 

<p><li>True enough. There isn't a book, prophet, or angel that would have caused skeptics to believe the foolish things in Islam or Christianity.
<a href="../6/index.htm#7">6:7-9</a>

<p><li>Pets are people, too! <a href="../6/index.htm#38">6:38</a>
