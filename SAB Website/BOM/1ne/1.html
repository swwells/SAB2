<font size="-1">

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (1:1) The first book of the Book of Mormon is the First Book of Nephi. The author is a 
guy named Nephi who thinks quite a lot of himself. He had "goodly parents" was "highly favored of the Lord" and had "a great knowledge of the 
goodness and the mysteries of God." 

<p><i>"I, Nephi ... born of goodly parents ... highly favored of the Lord ... having ... a great 
knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God" </i>

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif"> (1:1) "The mysteries of God" -- 
<a href="../../1cor/4.html#1">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif">
<img src="../../images/sci1.gif"> (1:2) Nephi wrote in "the language of his father" -- Egyptian, 
a strange language for an Israelite of 600 BCE to write in. But, then, we must get used to strange things if we are to 
read the Book of Mormon. 

<p><i>"Yea, I make a record in the language of my father ... the language of the Egyptians."</i><br>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (1:3) The book of 1 Nephi is true because Nephi says it is. And if you can't believe a pompous, Egyptian-speaking Hebrew that 
supposedly lived 2600 years ago, whom can you believe? 

<p><i>"I know that the record which I make is true."</i><br>

<p>(1:4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 14, 19)<br>
<a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a> 

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif">
<img src="../../images/sci1.gif"> (1:6) Lehi (Nephi's father) prayed and pillar of fire appeared out of nowhere on a rock.

<p><i>"There came a pillar of fire and dwelt upon a rock ... and ... 
he did quake and tremble <a href="exceed_list.html">exceedingly</a>."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (1:8-14)

<p>(1:8-10) After Lehi saw the burning pillar on a rock, he "he 
thought he saw" God, lots of angels, Jesus, and the 12 apostles -- 
which is a strange sight for a Jew that lived 600 years before Jesus was born. 

<p><i>"He thought he saw God ... with numberless ... angels 
... and ... he saw One ... and ... twelve others."</i>

<p>(1:11) God, Jesus, the apostles, and the host of angels 
came down from heaven to earth and God gave Lehi a book to read. 

<p><i>"They came down ... and gave unto him a book."</i>

<p>(1:13-14) Lehi read from the book that God gave him while he 
quoted from Revelation -- which wasn't written for another 700 years or so.

<p><i>"He read, saying: Wo, wo, unto Jerusalem, for 
I have seen thine abominations! ... Great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God Almighty!"</i></p>

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif" border="0" width="32" height="32"> (1:14)<br>

in all my days; yea, <span class="a">having</span> had <span class="a">a great knowledge of the goodness and</span> 
  <span class="plag">the mysteries of God</span>, therefore I make a record of my 
proceedings in my days. 

<tr><td><b><a name="2">1:2</a> </b>   <span class="sci">Yea, I make a record</span> <span class="sci">in the language of my father</span>, which consists of the 
learning of the Jews and <span class="sci">the language of the Egyptians</span>. 

<tr><td><b><a name="3">1:3</a> </b>   And <span class="a">I know that the record which I make is true</span>; and I make it with mine own hand; and I make it according 
to my knowledge. 

<tr><td><b><a name="4">1:4</a> </b>   For <span class="a">it came to pass</span> in the commencement of the first year of the reign of Zedekiah, 
king of Judah, (my father, Lehi, having dwelt at Jerusalem in all his days); and in that same year there came many prophets, 
prophesying unto the people that they must repent, or the great city Jerusalem must be destroyed. 

<tr><td><b> <a name="5">1:5</a> </b>   Wherefore <span class="a">it came to pass</span> that my 
father, Lehi, as he went forth prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all 
his heart, in behalf of his people. 

<tr><td><b><a name="6">1:6</a></b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> as he prayed unto 
the Lord, <span class="a">there came a pillar of fire and dwelt upon a rock before him</span>; and he saw and 
heard much; and because of the things which he saw and heard <span class="a">he did 
quake and tremble exceedingly</span>. 

<tr><td><b><a name="7">1:7</a></b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that he returned to his own house at Jerusalem; and 
he cast himself upon his bed, being overcome with the Spirit and the things which he had seen. 

<tr><td><b><a name="8">1:8</a></b>   And being thus overcome with the Spirit, <span class="a">he was carried away in a vision</span>, even that he saw the heavens 
open, and <span class="a">he thought he saw God</span> sitting upon his throne, surrounded <span class="a">with numberless</span> concourses of<span class="a"> angels</span> in the attitude 
of singing and praising their God. 

<tr><td><b><a name="9">1:9</a></b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that 
	<span class="a">he saw One</span> descending out 
of the midst of heaven, and he beheld that his luster 
was above that of the sun at noon-day. 

<tr><td><b><a name="10">1:10</a></b>   <span class="a">And</span> he also saw <span class="a">twelve others</span> following him, and their brightness did exceed that of the stars in the 
firmament. 

<tr><td><b><a name="11">1:11</a></b>   And <span class="a">they came down</span> and went forth upon the face of the earth; 
and the first came and stood before my father, <span class="a">and gave unto him a book</span>, and bade him that he should read. 

<tr><td><b><a name="12">1:12</a></b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that as he read, he was filled with the Spirit of the 
Lord. 

<tr><td><b><a name="13">1:13</a></b>   And <span class="a">he read, saying: Wo, wo, unto Jerusalem, for I have seen thine abominations!</span>  Yea, and many 
things did my father read concerning Jerusalem -- that it should be destroyed, and the inhabitants thereof; many should 
perish by the sword, and many should be carried away captive into Babylon. 

<tr><td><b><a name="14">1:14</a></b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass </span>that when my father had read and seen many great and 
marvelous things, he did exclaim many things unto the Lord; such as: <span class="plag">Great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God 
Almighty!</span>  Thy throne is high in the heavens, and thy power, and goodness, and mercy are over all the inhabitants of 
the earth, and, because thou art merciful, thou wilt not suffer those who come unto thee that 
they shall perish! 

<tr><td><b><a name="15">1:15</a></b>   And after this manner was the language of my father in the praising of his God; for his soul did 
rejoice, and his whole heart was filled, because of the things which he had seen, yea, which the Lord had shown unto 
him. 

<tr><td><b><a name="16">1:16</a></b>   And now I, Nephi, do not make a full account of the things which my father hath written, for he hath 
written many things which he saw in visions and in dreams; and he also hath written many things which he prophesied and 
spake unto his children, of which I shall not make a full account. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18">1:18</a></b>   Therefore, I would that ye should know, that after the Lord had shown so many marvelous things unto my 
father, Lehi, yea, concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, behold he went forth among the people, and began to prophesy 
and to declare unto them concerning the things which he had both seen and heard. 

<tr><td><b><a name="19">1:19</a></b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that <span class="i">the 
Jews did mock him because</span> of the things which he testified of them; for <span class="i">he truly 
testified of their wickedness and their abominations</span>; and he 
testified that the  things which he saw and heard, and also the things which he read in 
the book, manifested  plainly of the coming of the Messiah, and also the redemption of the 
world. <td bgcolor="eeeeee" rowspan="2">

After Lehi saw the pillar of fire, God, Jesus, the apostles, and angels, and read from the book that God gave him, he went into town 
to tell the people about it. They all thought he was crazy, since they were a bunch of wicked, abominable Jews.

<p><i>"The Jews did mock him because ... he truly testified of 
their wickedness and their abominations ... they were angry with him ... as with the prophets of old, whom they had cast out and stoned."</i>

<tr><td><b><a name="20">1:20</a></b>   And when <span class="i">the Jews</span> heard these things 
	<span class="i">they were 
angry with him</span>; yea, even <span class="i">as with the prophets of old, whom they 
had cast out, and stoned</span>, and slain; and they also sought his life, that they might 
take it away.  But behold, I, Nephi, will show unto you that the tender mercies of the Lord 
are over all those whom he hath chosen, because of their faith, to make them mighty even unto the power of deliverance.
