<p><li>  If a good person does something wrong after God &quot;lays a stumbling block before 
him,&quot; then God will kill him.  &quot;He shall die in his sin&quot; and whatever good he 
has done will be forgotten. <a href="3.html#20">3:20</a>

<p><li> God will cause the fathers to eat their sons and the sons to eat their fathers.  
<a href="5.html#10">5:10</a>

<p><li> God will slaughter
everyone by killing one third with plagues, one third with famines, and one third
with wars. If any somehow survive, he'll send &quot;evil beasts&quot; to devour
them. Finally, after he's done killing, he &quot;will be comforted.&quot; <a href="5.html#11">5:11-17</a>

<p><li> God will decorate the land with the bones and dead bodies of those who worship a different god.
  <a href="6.html#4">6:4-5</a>
  
<p><li> God makes his presence known by killing people with famine, disease, and war. <a href="6.html#7">6:7-14</a>

<p><li> God will pour out his fury on
everyone, with pity toward none. By so doing he says that
&quot;ye shall know that I am the Lord that smiteth.&quot; Indeed, who would else would
behave so viciously? <a href="7.html#3">7:3-9</a>

<p><li> God's is mad at everyone and no one will escape his wrath. He'll kill them all with war, 
disease, and starvation. "Horror shall cover them" and "they shall know that I am the Lord."  
<a href="7.html#14">7:14-28</a>

<p><li> God promises again to slaughter everyone. He says that he will ignore them when they plead with him for mercy. 
<a href="8.html#18">8:18</a>

<p><li> God sends a &quot;man clothed with linen&quot; to mark the foreheads of the men who will be saved. Apparently only men are considered 
good enough to keep, the others (unmarked men, &quot;maids&quot;, little children, and women) are to be slaughtered. God says he'll &quot;fill 
the courts with the slain&quot; and will have pity on no one. <a href="9.html#4">9:4-10</a>

<p><li> When you fall by the sword, you'll know that God is the Lord.  <a href="11.html#8">11:8-12</a>

<p><li> When God kills everyone in the city, then you'll know that he is the Lord. (Who else would be so cruel?)  
<a href="12.html#15">12:15-16, 20</a>

<p><li> God gets mad at a wall and destroys it, along with those who worked on it.

 <p><li>God again vows to destroy those that dare worship something or someone other than him. 
<a href="16.html#6">14:6-8</a>

<p><li> God deceives some of his prophets and then kills them for believing his lies. 
<a href="14.html#9">14:9</a>

<p><li>When really bad things happen (like you get eaten by wild beasts, get killed in war, get 
sick and die, etc.), then you'll know that it was God that did it to you. 
<a href="14.html#13">14:13, 15, 19, 21</a>

<p><li> God will burn the inhabitants of Jerusalem to show everyone that he is the Lord. 
 <a href="15.html#6">15:6-7</a>
 
<p><li>For being such a whore, God punished Jerusalem by starving the Israelites and handing 
them over to the Philistines. <a href="16.html#17">16:17</a>

<p><li>After exposing her nakedness, God will give her "blood in fury and jealousy" and strip her naked once 
more. <a href="16.html#38">16:38-41</a>

<p><li> God gave the Israelites &quot;statutes that
were not good and judgments whereby they should not live.&quot; He
&quot;polluted&quot; them so that he &quot;might make them desolate&quot; and 
force them to kill and sacrifice their&nbsp; children &quot;that they might 
know&quot; that he is the Lord. <a href="20.html#25">20:25-26</a>

<p><li> God will set a fire in the southern kingdom that will devour everything and burn everyone. "And 
    all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it." <a href="20.html#47">20:47-48</a>
    
<p><li> God will kill everyone -- good and bad, just and unjust. <a href="21.html#3">21:3-4</a>

<p><li>"Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land ... for I the LORD 
have spoken it." <a href="21.html#32">21:32</a>

<p><li> God will gather all of Israel and consume them in the fires of his anger.  <a href="22.html#20">22:20-22</a>

<p><li> God couldn't find anyone to stand up to him, so he's going to destroy everyone.  <a href="22.html#30">22:30-31</a>

<p><li> Two sisters were guilty of &quot;committing whoredoms&quot; by pressing their breasts and 
bruising &quot;the teats of their virginity.&quot; As a punishment, one sister's nakedness was 
discovered, her children were taken from her, and she was killed by the sword. And the fate of the 
surviving sister was even worse: Her nose and ears were cut off, she was made to &quot;pluck off&quot; 
her own breasts, and then after being raped and mutilated, she is stoned to death. 
<a href="23.html#1">23:1-49</a>

<p><li> God gets all excited about cooking with &quot;scum&quot; and human flesh, saying &quot;kindle 
the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned." <a href="24.html#3">24:3-14</a>

    When he's done with the killing everyone will know that he is the Lord.   <a href="25.html#6">25:6-17</a>
    
<p><li> God says he will destroy Tyrus. He plans to kill everyone, but he is especially looking 
 forward to killing all of the women. "And her daughters  which are in the field shall be slain by the sword; and 
they shall know that I am the LORD." <a href="26.html#1">26:1-21</a>

<p><li> Watch out or God will make you &quot;die the deaths of the uncircumcised,&quot; which is, 
no doubt, a most unpleasant death. <a href="28.html#10">28:10</a>

<p><li> God says that Zidon will know that he is the Lord when he  sends &quot;pestilence and 
blood into her streets.&quot; <a href="28.html#22">28:22-23</a>

<p><li> God tells Ezekiel to prophesy against the pharaoh and against all Egypt. God says he will 
feed the Egyptians to the birds and beasts. <a href="29.html#2">29:2-5</a>

<p><li> God will punish Egypt and her allies by sending Nebuchadrezzar to &quot;fill the land with 
the slain.&quot; Then he will make &quot;the rivers dry,&quot; sell the land to &quot;the
wicked,&quot; make &quot;the land waste,&quot; light fires, and kill all the young men with 
the sword. <a href="30.html#4">30:4-26</a>

<p><li>"And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I have set a fire in Egypt." (The Divine Pyromaniac) 
<a href="30.html#8">30:8</a>, <a href="30.html#14">30:14</a>, <a href="30.html#16">30:16</a> 

<p><li>God will vex the hearts of many people, destroy entire nations, brandish his sword, kill animals,

<a href="32.html#9">32:9-15</a>

<p><li>Pharaoh and all his multitude, along with the uncircumcised, will be killed with the sword. 
<a href="32.html#20">32:20-32</a>  
 
<p><li>If a "righteous" person does something wrong, God will forget every good thing
that that person has ever done. Then God will kill him for the single mistake. 
<a href="33.html#13">33:13</a>

<p><li> God will kill everyone in the cities, "and thou shalt know that I am the LORD."
 <a href="35.html#3">35:3-4</a>
 
<p><li>"And I will fill his mountains with his slain men, and ye shalt know that I am the LORD." 
<a href="35.html#6">35:6-9</a>

<p><li> God will cause each man's sword to be against his brother; he will send disease and make it 
rain fire and brimstone. He says that by doing this he'll magnify and sanctify himself and let 
everyone know that he is the Lord. <a href="38.html#21">38:21-23</a>

<p><li> God will have birds and beasts eat human flesh and drink human blood until
