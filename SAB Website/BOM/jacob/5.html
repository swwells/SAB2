This is the longest and most boring chapter in  the most boring book ever written (The Book of Mormon). Thirty-one times it came to pass that the 
trees were cumbered, grafted, pruned, plucked, dunged, and digged about for no apparent purpose, except to waste

the Lord. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

olive-tree, which a man took and nourished in his vineyard; and it grew, and waxed old, and began to decay. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

me; and we will pluck off those main branches which are beginning to wither away, and we will cast them into the fire 
that they may be burned. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

will graft them whithersoever I will; and it mattereth not that if it so be that the root of this tree will perish, I 
may preserve the fruit thereof unto myself; wherefore, I will take these young and tender branches, and I will graft them

of the vineyard, and grafted in the branches of the wild olive-tree. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>5:11</b>   And the Lord of the vineyard caused that it should be digged about, and pruned, and nourished, saying 
unto his servant: It grieveth me that I should lose this tree; wherefore, that perhaps I might preserve the roots 
thereof that they perish not, that I might preserve them unto myself, I have done this thing. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

fruit thereof against the season, unto myself; for it grieveth me that I should lose this tree and the fruit 
thereof. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>5:14</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Lord of the vineyard went his way, and hid the natural branches of the

the fruit thereof was like unto the natural fruit. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>5:18</b>   And he said unto the servant: Behold, the branches of the wild tree have taken hold of the moisture of 
the root thereof, that the root thereof hath brought forth much strength; and because of the much strength of the root 
thereof the wild branches have brought forth tame fruit.  Now, if we had not grafted in these branches, the tree thereof 
would have perished.   And now, behold, I shall lay up much fruit, which the tree thereof hath brought forth; and the 
fruit thereof I shall lay up against the season, unto mine own self. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>5:19</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Lord of the vineyard said unto the servant: Come, let us go to the

also that it was good.   And he said unto the servant: Take of the fruit thereof, and lay it up against the season, that 
I may preserve it unto mine own self; for behold, said he, this long time have I nourished it, and it hath brought forth 
much fruit. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>5:21</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the servant said unto his master: How comest thou hither to plant this tree, 
or this branch of the tree?  For behold, it was the poorest spot in all the land of thy vineyard. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>5:22</b>   And the Lord of the vineyard said unto him: Counsel me not; I knew that it was a poor spot of ground; 
wherefore, I said unto thee, I have nourished it this long time, and thou beholdest that it hath brought forth much 
fruit. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>5:23</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Lord of the vineyard said unto his servant: Look hither; behold I have 
planted another branch of the tree also; and thou knowest that this spot of ground was poorer than the first.  But, 
behold the tree.  I have nourished it this long time, and it hath brought forth much fruit; therefore, gather it, and 
lay it up against the season, that I may preserve it unto mine own self. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>5:24</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Lord of the vineyard said again unto his servant: Look hither, and behold

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>5:25</b>   And he said unto the servant: Look hither and behold the last.  Behold, this have I planted in a good 
spot of ground; and I have nourished it this long time, and only a part of the tree hath brought forth tame fruit, and 
the other part of the tree hath brought forth wild fruit; behold, I have nourished this tree like unto the others. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>5:26</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Lord of the vineyard said unto the servant: Pluck off the branches that 
have not brought forth good fruit, and cast them into the fire. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>5:27</b>   But behold, the servant said unto him: Let us prune it, and dig about it, and nourish it a little 
longer, that perhaps it may bring forth good fruit unto thee, that thou canst lay it up against the season. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

servant: Come, let us go down into the vineyard, that we may labor again in the vineyard.  For behold, the time 
draweth near, and the end soon cometh; wherefore, I must lay up fruit against the season, unto mine own self. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>5:30</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Lord of the vineyard and the servant went down into the vineyard; and 
they came to the tree whose natural branches had been broken off, and the wild branches had been grafted in; and behold 
all sorts of fruit did cumber the tree. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>5:31</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Lord of the vineyard did taste of the fruit, every sort according to 
its number.  And the Lord of the vineyard said: Behold, this long time have we nourished this tree, and I have laid up 
unto myself against the season much fruit. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="32"></a>5:32</b>   But behold, this time it hath brought forth much fruit, and there is none of it which is good.  And 
behold, there are all kinds of bad fruit; and it profiteth me nothing, notwithstanding all our labor; and now it grieveth 
me that I should lose this tree. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="33"></a>5:33</b>   And the Lord of the vineyard said unto the servant: What shall we do unto the tree, that I may preserve 
again good fruit thereof unto mine own self? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="34"></a>5:34</b>   And the servant said unto his master: Behold, because thou didst graft in the branches of the wild 
olive-tree they have nourished the roots, that they are alive and they have not perished; wherefore thou beholdest that 
they are yet good. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="35"></a>5:35</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Lord of the vineyard said unto his servant: The tree profiteth me nothing, 
and the roots thereof profit me nothing so long as it shall bring forth evil fruit. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="36"></a>5:36</b>   Nevertheless, I know that the roots are good, and for mine own purpose I have preserved them; and 
because of their much strength they have hitherto brought forth, from the wild branches, good fruit. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="37"></a>5:37</b>   But behold, the wild branches have grown and have overrun the roots thereof; and because that the wild 
branches have overcome the roots thereof it hath brought forth much evil fruit; and because that it hath brought forth so 
much evil fruit thou beholdest that it beginneth to perish; and it will soon become ripened, that it may be cast into 
the fire, except we should do something for it to preserve it. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="38"></a>5:38</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Lord of the vineyard said unto his servant: Let us go down into the 
nethermost parts of the vineyard, and behold if the natural branches have also brought forth evil fruit. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="39"></a>5:39</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they went down into the nethermost 
parts of the vineyard.  <span class="a">And it came to 
pass</span> that they beheld that the fruit of the natural branches had become corrupt also; yea, the first and the second 
and also the last; and they had all become corrupt. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="40"></a>5:40</b>   And the wild fruit of the last had overcome that part of the tree which brought forth good fruit, 
even that the branch had withered away and died. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="41"></a>5:41</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Lord of the vineyard wept, and said unto the servant: What could I have 
done more for my vineyard? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="42"></a>5:42</b>   Behold, I knew that all the fruit of the vineyard, save it were these, had become corrupted.  And now

my vineyard <span class="plag">are good for nothing save it be to be hewn down and cast into the fire.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
