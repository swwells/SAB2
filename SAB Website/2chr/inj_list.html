<H3>Injustice in 2 Chronicles</H3>
<ol>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="inj.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p><li>God tells Solomon that he likes him so darned much (he likes murderers and polygamists) that 
    he's going to make him the richest man who has ever lived. <a href="1.html#11">1:11-12</a>

<p><li>God sent Shishak, the king of Egypt, to attack Jerusalem because Rehoboam "and all Israel transgressed against the Lord." 
Shishak had 1200 chariots, 60,000 horsemen and "people without number" and he attacked Judah and "took the fenced cities which 
pertained to Judah." When Shishak's army came to Jerusalem, "the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves" and said, 
"The Lord is righteous." So God decided not to destroy Jerusalem, but just make them Shishak's slaves instead. 
<a href="12.html#2">12:2-12</a>

<p><li>God kills the king of Israel and helps Abijah kill 500,000 Israelites. "The children of Judah prevailed,
because they relied upon the Lord God of their fathers." (That is, they had God on their side.)  
<a href="13.html#13">13:15-20</a>

<p><li>In the largest single God-assisted massacre in the Bible, Asa, with God's help, kills one million Ethiopians.
 <a href="14.html#8">14:8-14</a>
 
<p><li>"Nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all 
adversity." <a href="15.html#6">15:6</a>

<p><li>"Whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or
    great, whether man or woman." <a href="15.html#13">15:13</a>

<p><li>God puts lies into the mouths of his prophets and speaks evil about people. 
<a href="18.html#21">18:21-22</a>

<p><li>"A certain man drew a bow ... and smote the king of Israel ... and about the time of the sun going down he died."<br>
    God killed Ahab for showing mercy to king Benhadad. (See <a href="../1kg/20.html#42">1 Kings 20:42</a>) 
    <a href="18.html#33">18:33-34</a>

<p><li>Hate the sinner -- or God will pour his wrath out on you.  <a href="19.html#2">19:2</a>

<p><li>The spirit of the Lord came upon Jahaziel (the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, 
the son of Mattanaiah) and told the people of Judah that they didn't have to fight against the Moabites, Ammonites, 
and Edomites. God would fight for them. And he did. God fought for them by forcing the members of the opposing army 
to kill each other. Then the people of Judah spent three days stripping the jewels and other valuables from the dead bodies.  
<a href="20.html#14">20:14-25</a>

<p><li>Elijah tells Jehoram that God will smite his children, wives, and the people of Judah with a 
great plague (for things that Jehoram did) and God will smite him with a disease of his bowels until 
his bowels fall out.  <a href="21.html#14">21:14-15</a>

<p><li>The LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians ... 
And they came up into Judah, and ... and carried away ... his sons also, and his wives; so that there 
was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons." <a href="21.html#16">21:16-17</a>

<p><li>"And after all this the LORD smote him in his 
bowels with an incurable disease. And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels 
fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases." <a href="21.html#18">21:18-19</a>

<p><li>God told Jehu to kill everyone in the house of Ahab and then later condemned him for 
it (<a href="../hos/1.html#4">Hosea 1:4</a>). <a href="22.html#7">22:7-9</a>

<p><li>Only Levites can enter "the house of the Lord". "Whosoever else cometh 
into the house, he shall be put to death." <a href="23.html#6">23:6-7</a>

<p><li>The priest (Jehoiada) tells the people to kill Athaliah and her followers. So they find her and kill 
her. "And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after
    that they had slain Athaliah with the sword." (Don't you just love happy endings?)
 <a href="23.html#14">23:14-15, 21</a>
 
 <p><li>"Then all the people went to the house of Baal" and broke its altar into pieces 
and killed Mattan the priest of Baal. <a href="23.html#17">23:17</a>

<p><li>Joash and Jehoida collect tons of money to repair "the house of the Lord." Religious 
    leaders have been taking money from people ever since. <a href="24.html#4">24:4-11</a>

<p><li>The spirit of God came upon Zechariah and he condemned everyone for disobeying God, so the people stoned him to death. 
As he was dying, Zechariah asked God to avenge his death. So God sent the Syrians to kill all the princes and God delivered 
the army of Judah into their hand. In the process, Joash was wounded and then killed in his bed.  <a href="24.html#20">24:20-25</a>

<p><li>Amaziah (who "did that which was right in the sight of the Lord") killed 10,000 people; another 
10,000 he left alive to throw off a cliff "that they all were broken in pieces."
  <a href="25.html#1">25:1-2, 11-12</a>
  
  <p><li>God was pleased with Amaziah when he was slaughtering Edomites and throwing people off cliffs, but not when he decided 
to worship other gods. So God decided to kill Amaziah and cause his army to be defeated by the Israelites.
 <a href="25.html#16">25:16-27</a>

<p><li>"Uzziah ... did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all
    that his father Amaziah did."<br>
    LIke throwing 10,000 men off a cliff? (See <a href="25.html#12">25:12</a>) <a href="26.html#3">26:3-4</a> 
    
<p><li>"He went forth and warred against the Philistines ... And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that
    dwelt in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims." <a href="26.html#6">26:6-7</a>  
  
<p><li>God makes Uzziah a leper for burning incense without a license.  <a href="26.html#19">26:19-21</a>

<p><li>Pekah killed 120,000 people in one day and enslaves 200,000 women and children
"because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers." <a href="28.html#6">28:6-8</a>

<p><li>"With us is the LORD our God to help us, and to fight our battles." <a href="32.html#8">32:8</a>

<p><li>God sent an angel to kill the Assyrian army. (According to 
<a href="../2kg/19.html#35">2 Kings 19:35</a> the angel killed 185,000 sleeping soldiers who 
woke the next morning to discover that they were dead.) <a href="32.html#21">32:21</a>

<p><li>God vows to "bring evil upon this place ... even all the curses that are written in the book." He says his
"wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched."  <a href="34.html#24">34:24-25</a>

<p><li>God gets angry with his people, so he sends the king of the Chaldees to kill all the "young men with the
sword." He has compassion for no one, not even old men that are "stooped for age." In his tender mercy and loving
kindness he has them all slaughtered.  <a href="36.html#16">36:16-17</a>
