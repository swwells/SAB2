<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (1:1b-4) Nephi is getting ready to die so he tells his little brother Jacob to write precious things down 
on "the small plates" -- not "the other plates" that Nephi wrote stuff on for Christ's sake. 

<p>(1:1b) "Fifty and five years had passed away from the time that Lehi left 
Jerusalem; wherefore, Nephi gave me, Jacob, a commandment concerning the small plates."</i>

<p>(1:2) <i>"And he gave me, Jacob, a commandment that I should write upon these plates a few of the things which I

<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>1:1</b>   For behold, <span class="a">it came to pass</span> that <span class="a">fifty and five years had passed 
away from the time that Lehi left 
Jerusalem; wherefore, Nephi gave me, Jacob, a commandment concerning the small plates</span>, upon which these things are 
engraven. 

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>1:2</b>   <span class="a">And he gave me, Jacob, a commandment that I should write upon these plates a few of the things which I 
consider to be most precious; that I should not touch, save it were lightly, concerning the history of this people which 
are called the people of Nephi.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>1:3</b>   <span class="a">For he said that the history of his people should be engraven upon his other plates</span>, and that I should 
preserve these plates and hand them down unto my seed, from generation to generation. 

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>1:4</b>   And if there were preaching which was sacred, or revelation which was great, or prophesying, that I 
should engraven the heads of them upon these plates, and touch upon them as much as it were possible, 
	<span class="a">for Christ's sake</span>, 
and for the sake of our people. 

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>1:5</b>   For because of faith and great anxiety, it truly had been made manifest unto us concerning our people, 
what things should happen unto them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>1:6</b>   And we also had many revelations, and the spirit of much prophecy; wherefore, we knew of Christ and his 
kingdom, which should come. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>1:7</b>   Wherefore we labored diligently among our people, that we might persuade them to come unto Christ, and 
partake of the goodness of God, that they might enter into his rest, lest by any means he should swear in his wrath they 
should not enter in, as in the provocation in the days of temptation while the children of Israel were in the 
wilderness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>1:8</b>   Wherefore, we would to God that we could persuade all men not to rebel against God, to provoke him to 
anger, but that all men would believe in Christ, and view his death, and suffer his cross and bear the shame of the 
world; wherefore, I, Jacob, take it upon me to fulfil the commandment of my brother Nephi. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>1:9</b>   Now Nephi began to be old, and he saw that he must soon die; wherefore, he anointed a man to be a king 
and a ruler over his people now, according to the reigns of the kings. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>1:10</b>   The people having loved Nephi <span class="a">exceedingly</span>, he having been a great protector for them, having wielded the 
sword of Laban in their defence, and having labored in all his days for their welfare --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

stead were called by the people, second Nephi, third Nephi, and so forth, according to the reigns of the kings; and thus 
they were called by the people, let them be of whatever name they would. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>1:12</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Nephi died. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>1:13</b>   Now the people which were not Lamanites were Nephites; nevertheless, they were called Nephites, 
Jacobites, Josephites, Zoramites, Lamanites, Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>1:14</b>   But I, Jacob, shall not hereafter distinguish them by these names, but I shall call them Lamanites that 
seek to destroy the people of Nephi, and those who are friendly to Nephi I shall call Nephites, or the people of Nephi, 
according to the reigns of the kings. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>1:15</b>   And now <span class="a">it came to pass that the people of Nephi</span>, under the reign
