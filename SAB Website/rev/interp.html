<p><li><a href="../contra/seejesus.html">Will Jesus' second coming be visible to all?</a> Well, not according to the Jehovah's 
Witnesses, anyway. Even though Jesus (<a href="../mt/24.html#30">Mt 24:30</a>) says he'll return "on the clouds of heaven with 
great power and glory" and this verse says that "every eye shall see him," The Governing Body claims that Jesus returned invisibly 
in 1914 without clouds, glory, or being seen by anyone.  <a href="1.html#7">1:7</a>

<p><li>JWs believe that there are two distinct classes of believers: the 144,000 &quot;Anointed" that are going to heaven and 
the "Great Crowd" that will remain here on earth. The WatchTower teaches that heaven closed in 1935, and that everyone else will 
either be killed at Armageddon (if they are not JWs) or live forever on earth. <a href="7.html#4">7:4</a>

<p><li>The "great multitude" is the WatchTower's "great crowd" that it claims will remain on earth 
rather than going to heaven. Yet in this verse the "great crowd" stands "before the throne" and "before the lamb". Where else 
would the thrown and lamb be besides heaven?  <a href="7.html#9">7:9</a>

<p><li>"And the name of the star is called Wormwood."<br>
Some believers say that the 1986 nuclear disaster at Chernobyl was the fulfillment of the 
third trumpet in 8:10-11.  <a href="8.html#10">8:10-11</a>

<p><li>Catholics say the "woman clothed with the sun" is Mary; Protestants say it is Israel, the church, or Eve. 
But whoever she is, she's pregnant and the dragon wants to eat her newborn baby. He's worked up an 
appetite by knocking 
down 1/3 of the stars with his tail. But when the woman delivered, God beamed her baby boy up to heaven. Then the 
woman went into the wilderness to feed for 1260 days. Whatever. <a href="12.html#1">12:1-6</a>

<p><li>Are the 144,000 men that are "not defiled by women" homosexuals? Are only gay men to be saved? <a href="14.html#1">14:1-4</a>

<a href="20.html#14">20:14-15</a>

<p><li>"I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets"<br>
Mormon apologists use this verse to explain the plagiarism of the Bible in the Book of Mormon. (Prophets sometimes send 
angelic visitors to other prophets to help with the proper wording of scripture.) <a href="22.html#9">22:9</a>
