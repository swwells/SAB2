    <img src="../images/inj1.gif"> (20:1-15) <i>The parable of the unfair, lying employer</i><br>
    The kingdom of heaven is like a business that hires workers, paying each the same wage 
    (one penny). Some work 12 hours for the penny; others 9, 6, or 3 hours; and others for only one hour. If one of the 12-hour workers 
    complains about it, his boss says, "Hey, didn't you agree to work all day for a penny? What are you complaining about? 
    From this parable, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtCpVhRtlZ4">David Barton (and the Republicans) claim that Jesus was 
    against the minimum wage</a>.
    
    <p>But the employer didn't say he'd pay each of the workers a penny; he said he'd pay them "whatsoever is right" (vv.4,7). 
    Is it right for one employee to be paid twelve times as much as another when both are doing the same type of work?    
    
    <p>(20:1) <i>"The kingdom of heaven is like unto a man ... which went out early in the morning to hire labourers."</i>
    
    <p>(20:2) <i>"He ... agreed with the labourers for a penny a day."</i>
    
    <p>(20:3-4) <i>"He went out about the third hour, and saw others ... And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, 
    and whatsoever is right I will give you."</i>
    
    <p>(20:5) <i>"He went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise."</i>
    
    <p>(20:6-7) <i>"About the eleventh hour he went out, and found others ... 
    and saith unto them ... Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive."</i>
    
    <p>(20:9) <i>"When they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received  every man a penny."</i>
    
    <p>(20:10) <i>"But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received
    more; and they likewise received every man a penny."</i>
