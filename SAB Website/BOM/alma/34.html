"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",
"<span class='i'>Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever.</span>--<a href='3.html#14'>Alma 3:14</a>",
"<span class='i'>I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</span>--<a href='3.html#15'>Alma 3:15</a>",
"<span class='I'>If ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd ... the devil is your shepherd.</span>--<a href='5.html#39'>Alma 5:39</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",
"<span class='a'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges ... even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year....</span>--<a href='16.html#1'>Alma 16:1</a>",
"<span class='a'>Their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.</span>--<a href='16.html#11'>Alma 16:11</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",
"<span class='v'>He [Ammon] smote off their arms with his sword; for he did withstand their blows by smiting their arms with the edge of his sword.</span>--<a href='17.html#37'>Alma 17:37</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.   Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</span>--<a href='30.html#22'>Alma 30:22</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",
"<span class='i'>God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.</span>--<a href='30.html#47'>Alma 30:47</a>",
"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Amalekites were of a more wicked and murderous disposition than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='43.html#6'>Alma 43:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lord is with us; and ye behold that he has delivered you into our hands.</span>--<a href='44.html#3'>Alma 44:3</a>",
"<span class='i'>God ... has strengthened  our arms that we have gained power over you, by  our faith, by our religion, and by our rites of worship, and by  our church.</span>--<a href='44.html#5'>Alma 44:5</a>",
"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",
"<span class='i'>These dissenters ... became ... more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='47.html#36'>Alma 47:36</a>",
"<span class='a'>God would prosper them in the land, or in other words ... God ... would prosper them in the land.</span>--<a href='48.html#15'>Alma 48:15</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='50.html#22'>Alma 50:22</a>",
"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",
"<span class='i'>The remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty.</span>--<a href='51.html#20'>Alma 51:20</a>",
"<span class='g'>And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye.</span>--<a href='54.html#21'>Alma 54:21</a>",
"<span class='v'>We did slay upwards of two thousand of them after they had surrendered themselves prisoners of war.</span>--<a href='57.html#14'>Alma 57:14</a>",

<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>34:1</b>   <span class="a">And now it came to pass</span> that after Alma had spoken these words unto them he sat down upon the ground, 
and Amulek arose and began to teach them, saying: <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32"><a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a>
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>34:2</b>   My brethren, I think that it is impossible that 
ye should be ignorant of the things which have been spoken concerning the coming of Christ, who is taught by us to be 
the Son of God; yea, I know that these things were taught unto you bountifully before your dissension from among 
us. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>34:3</b>   And as ye have desired of my beloved brother that he should make known unto you what ye should do, 
because of your afflictions; and he hath spoken somewhat unto you to prepare your minds; yea, and he hath exhorted 
you unto faith and to patience --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>34:4</b>   Yea, even that ye would have so much faith as even to plant the word in your 
hearts, that ye may <span class="a">try the experiment</span> of its goodness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1">When it comes to religion, Mormons believe in experimenting. Just believe and see what happens. If it feels good, believe it.</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>34:5</b>   And we have beheld that the great question which is in your minds is whether the 
word be in the Son of God, or whether there shall be no Christ. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>34:6</b>   And ye also beheld that my brother has proved unto you, in many instances, that the word is in 
Christ unto salvation. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>34:7</b>   My brother has called upon the words of Zenos, that redemption cometh through the Son of God, 
and also upon the words of Zenock; and also he has appealed unto Moses, to prove that these things are true. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>34:8</b>   And now, behold, I will testify unto you of myself that these things are true.  Behold, I say 
unto you, that I do know that Christ shall come among the children of men, to take upon him the transgressions 
of his people, and that he shall atone for the sins of the world; for the Lord God hath spoken it. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>34:9</b>   For it is expedient that an atonement should be made; for according to the great plan of the 
Eternal God there must be an atonement made, or else all mankind must unavoidably perish; yea, all are 
hardened; yea, all are fallen and are lost, and must perish except it be through the atonement which it 
is expedient should be made. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>34:10</b>   For it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice; yea, not a sacrifice of 
man, neither of beast, neither of any manner of fowl; for it shall not be a human sacrifice; but it must be 
an infinite and eternal sacrifice. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>34:11</b>   Now there is not any man that can sacrifice his own blood which will atone for the sins of
 another.  Now, if a man murdereth, behold will our law, which is just, take the life of his brother?  I say 
 unto you, Nay. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>34:12</b>   But the law requireth the life of him who hath murdered; therefore there can be nothing 
 which is short of an infinite atonement which will suffice for the sins of the world. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>34:13</b>   Therefore, it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice; and then shall 
 there be, or it is expedient there should be, a stop to the shedding of blood; then shall the law of Moses 
 be fulfilled; yea, <span class="plag">it shall be all fulfilled, every jot and tittle</span>, and none shall have passed away. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/plag.gif" border="0" width="32" height="32">
One jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. -- 
<a href="../../mt/5.html#18">Matthew 5:18</a></font>

 <tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>34:14</b>   And behold, this is the whole meaning of the law, every whit pointing to that great and 
 last sacrifice; and that great and last sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>34:15</b>   And thus he shall bring salvation to all those who shall believe on his name; this being 
 the intent of this last sacrifice, to bring about the bowels of mercy, which overpowereth justice, and bringeth 
 about means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>34:16</b>   And thus mercy can satisfy the demands of justice, and encircles them in the arms of safety, 
 while he that exercises no faith unto repentance is exposed to the whole law of the demands of justice; therefore 
 only unto him that has faith unto repentance is brought about the great and eternal plan of redemption. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>34:17</b>   Therefore may God grant unto you, my brethren, that ye may begin to exercise your faith unto 
 repentance, that ye begin to call upon his holy name, that he would have mercy upon you; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>34:18</b>   Yea, cry unto him for mercy; for he is mighty to save. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>34:19</b>   Yea, humble yourselves, and continue in prayer unto him. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>34:20</b>   Cry unto him when ye are in your fields, yea, over all your flocks. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>34:21</b>   Cry unto him in your houses, yea, over all your household, both morning, mid-day, and evening. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>34:22</b>   Yea, cry unto him against the power of your enemies. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>34:23</b>   Yea, cry unto him against the devil, who is an enemy to all righteousness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>34:24</b>   Cry unto him over the crops of your fields, that ye may prosper in them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>34:25</b>   Cry over the flocks of your fields, that they may increase. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>34:26</b>   But this is not all; ye must pour out your souls in your closets, and your secret places, and in 
 your wilderness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>34:27</b>   Yea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your hearts be full, drawn out in prayer unto 
 him continually for your welfare, and also for the welfare of those who are around you. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>34:28</b>   And now behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, do not suppose that this is all; for after 
 ye have done all these things, <span class="g">if ye turn away the needy, and the naked, and visit not the sick and afflicted, 
 and impart of your substance, if ye have, to those who stand in need -- I say unto you, if ye do not any of 
 these things, behold, your prayer is vain</span>, and availeth you nothing, and ye are as hypocrites who do deny the 
 faith. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">Help the sick, the poor, and those in need.</font>
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>34:29</b>   Therefore, if ye do not remember to be charitable, ye are as dross, which the 
 refiners do  <span class="plag">cast out, (it being of no worth) and is trodden under foot of men.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/plag.gif" border="0" width="32" height="32"><font size="-1">
It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.
 -- <a href="../../mt/5.html#13">Matthew 5:13</a></font>
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>34:30</b>   And now, my brethren, I would that, after ye have received so many witnesses, seeing that the 
 holy scriptures testify of these things, ye come forth and bring fruit unto repentance. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>34:31</b>   Yea, I would that ye would come forth and harden not your hearts any longer; for behold, now is 
 the time and the day of your salvation; and therefore, if ye will repent and harden not your hearts, immediately 
 shall the great plan of redemption be brought about unto you. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="32"></a>34:32</b>   For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this 
 life is the day for men to perform their labors. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="33"></a>34:33</b>   And now, as I said unto you before, as ye have had so many witnesses, therefore, I beseech of 
 you that ye do not procrastinate the day of your repentance until the end; for after this day of life, which is 
 given us to prepare for eternity, behold, if we do not improve our time while in this life, then cometh the 
 night of darkness wherein there can be no labor performed. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="34"></a>34:34</b>   Ye cannot say, when ye are brought to that awful crisis, that I will repent, that I will return 
 to my God.  Nay, ye cannot say this; for that same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time that ye go 
 out of this life, that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="35"></a>34:35</b>   For behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of your repentance even until death, behold, ye 
 have become subjected to the spirit of the devil, and he doth seal you his; therefore, the Spirit of the Lord 
 hath withdrawn from you, and hath no place in you, and the devil hath all power over you; and this is the 
 final state of the wicked. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="36"></a>34:36</b>   And this I know, because the Lord hath said he dwelleth not in unholy temples, but in the 
 hearts of the righteous doth he dwell; yea, and he has also said that the righteous shall sit down in his 
 kingdom, to go no more out; but <span class="plag">their garments should be made white through the blood of the Lamb.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">

And have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
 -- <a href="../../rev/7.html#14">Revelation 7:14</a></font>
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="37"></a>34:37</b>   And now, my beloved brethren, I desire that ye should remember these things, and that ye 
 should work out your salvation with fear before God, and that ye should no more deny the coming of Christ; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
<tr><td><b><a name="38"></a>34:38</b>   That ye contend no more against the Holy Ghost, but that ye receive it, and take upon you the 
name of Christ; that ye humble yourselves even to the dust, and <span class="plag">worship God</span>, in whatsoever place ye may be in, 
<span class="plag">in spirit and in truth</span>; and that ye live in thanksgiving daily, for the many mercies and blessings which he 
doth bestow upon you. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.

<tr><td><b><a name="39"></a>34:39</b>   Yea, and I also exhort you, my brethren, that ye be watchful unto prayer continually, that 
ye may not be led away by the temptations of the devil, that he may not overpower you, that ye may not become
 his subjects at the last day; for behold, he rewardeth you no good thing. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="40"></a>34:40</b>   And now my beloved brethren, I would exhort you to have patience, and that ye bear with all 
 manner of afflictions; that ye do not revile against those who do cast you out because of your <span class="a">exceeding</span> 
 poverty, lest ye become sinners like unto them; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

 one day rest from all your afflictions. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
