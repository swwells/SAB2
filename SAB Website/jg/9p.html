       son could succeed him. Abimelech came up with a creative solution: he killed 70(?) brothers upon one stone. (He was trying to get in the Guinness Book of World Records.)
       
       <p>But Abimelech's youngest brother got away. So the two remaining sons, Abimelech and Jotham, schemed against each other, striving for control, with Abimelech winning out, becoming king.
