<i>The story of Nehor</i> (1:2-15)<br>
Nehor was killed for teaching universalism (the belief that all will be saved).
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>1:3</b>   And he had gone about among the people, preaching to them that which he termed to be the word of God, 
bearing down against the church; declaring unto the people that every priest and teacher ought to become popular; and 
they ought not to labor with their hands, but that they ought to be supported by the people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

need not fear nor tremble,</span> but that they might lift up their heads and rejoice; for the Lord had created all men, and 
had also redeemed all men; and, in the end, all men should have eternal life. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>1:5</b>   <span class="a"><span class="a">And it came to pass</span></span> that he did teach these things so 
much that many did believe on his words, even so many that they began to support him and give him money. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>1:6</b>   And he began to be lifted up in the pride of his heart, and to wear very costly apparel, yea, and even 
began to establish a church after the manner of his preaching. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>1:7</b>   <span class="a"><span class="a">And it came to pass</span></span> as he was going, to preach to those who 
believed on his word, he met a man who belonged to the church of God, yea, even one of their teachers; and he began to
 contend with him sharply, that he might lead away the people of the church; but the man withstood him, admonishing him 
 with the words of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

 delivering the people of Limhi out of bondage. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>1:9</b>   Now, because Gideon withstood him with the words of God he was wroth with Gideon, and drew his sword 
 and began to smite him.   Now Gideon being stricken with many years, therefore he was not able to withstand his blows, 
 therefore he was slain by the sword. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>1:10</b>   And the man who slew him was taken by the people of the church, and was brought before Alma, to be 
 judged according to the crimes which he had committed. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<p>Be ye steadfast, unmoveable. -- <a href="../../1cor/15.html#58">1 Corinthians 15:58</a></font>
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>1:26</b>   And when the priests left their labor to impart the word of God unto the people, the people also left 
 their labors to hear the word of God.  And when the priest had imparted unto them the word of God they all returned 
 again diligently unto their labors; and the priest, not esteeming himself above his hearers, for the preacher was no 
 better than the hearer, neither was the teacher any better than the learner; and thus they were all equal, and they 
 did all labor, every man according to his strength. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>1:27</b>   And <span class="g">they did impart of their substance, every man according to that which he had, to the poor, and 
 the needy, and the sick, and the afflicted;</span> and they did not wear costly apparel, yet they were neat and comely. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

 <tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>1:28</b>   And thus they did establish the affairs of the church; and thus they began to have continual peace 
 again, notwithstanding all their persecutions. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>1:29</b>   And now, because of the steadiness of the church they began to be <span class="a">exceedingly</span> rich, having abundance 
 of all things whatsoever they stood in need -- an abundance of flocks and herds, and fatlings of every kind, and also 
 abundance of <span class="sci">grain,</span> and of gold, and of silver, and of precious things, and abundance of 
	<span class="sci">silk and fine-twined linen</span>, 
 and all manner of good homely cloth. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

 <tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>1:30</b>   And thus, in their prosperous circumstances, 
	<span class="g">they did not send away any who were naked, or that were 
 hungry, or that were athirst, or that were sick, or that had not been nourished; and they did not set their hearts 
 upon riches; therefore they were liberal to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, whether 
 out of the church or in the church, having no respect to persons as to those who stood in need.

 <tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>1:31</b>   And thus they did prosper and become far more wealthy than those who did not belong to their 
 church. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="32"></a>1:32</b>   For <span class="i">those who did not belong to their church did indulge themselves in sorceries, and in idolatry or 
 idleness, and in babblings, and in envyings and strife; wearing costly apparel; being lifted up in the pride of their 
 own eyes; persecuting, lying, thieving, robbing, committing whoredoms, and murdering, and all manner of wickedness; </span>
 nevertheless, the law was put in force upon all those who did transgress it, inasmuch as it was possible. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">Those who didn't belong to the right church were lazy, wicked, babbling, idolatrous, proud people who 
were all a bunch of thieves and murderers. </font>
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="33"></a>1:33</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that by thus exercising the law upon them, every man 
 suffering according to that which he had done, they became more still, and durst not commit any wickedness if it were 
 known; therefore, there was much peace among the people of Nephi until the fifth year of the reign of the judges. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
