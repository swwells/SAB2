Michal was bought by David with 200 Philistine foreskins 
(<A href="../1sam/18.html#25">1 Samuel 18:25-27</A>), then she was "given" 
to Phatiel (<A href="../1sam/25.html#44">1 Samuel 25:44</A>), and then "taken back" by David. 
Poor Phatiel must have loved her dearly since he "went along weeping behind her."
