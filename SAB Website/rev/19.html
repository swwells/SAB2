    finally getting married. (Well, the lamb is, anyway. And I guess that's Jesus.)

(19:12) <b><i>"His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself."</i></b> 
Jesus has eyes of fire and many crowns on his head. But no one knows his name except for Jesus himself, and he's not telling 
(well until the next verse, that is).

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif" > 
<img src="../images/cr1.gif" >  (19:13) <i>"<b>He was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called 
The Word of God.</b>"</i> Jesus' clothes are dipped in blood and his secret name ("that no man knew") is "The Word of God".  (I bet you thought it was Jesus!)

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif" > 
<img src="../images/cr1.gif" >  (19:14-15) <br>
With eyes aflame, many crowns on his head, clothes dripping with blood, a sword sticking 
out of his mouth, and a secret name, Jesus leads the faithful in heaven into holy war on earth.

<p>(19:14) <i>"The armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean."</i>

<p>(19:15) <b>"Out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword</b>, that with it he should smite 
the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness 
and wrath of Almighty God."</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (19:16) <i>"He hath on his vesture and <b>on his thigh a name written</b>, KING OF KINGS,
    AND LORD OF LORDS."</i><br>
    Oh Goodie. Jesus has another secret name. He even has it written on his thigh. (Some sort of tattoo maybe?)

<p><img src="../images/cr1.gif" >
<img src="../images/inj1.gif" >
<img src="../images/lang1.gif" >(19:17-18)<br>
An angel calls all the fowls to feast upon the flesh of dead horses and human bodies, "both free and bond, both small and great." 

<p>(19:17) <i>"I saw an angel ... saying to all the fowls ... Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God."</i>

<p>(19:18) <i>"<b>Eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, 
and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men.</b>"</i>


<p><img src="../images/cr1.gif" >
<img src="../images/inj1.gif" >(19:20-21)<br>
The beast and the false prophet are cast
alive into a lake of fire. The rest were killed with the sword of Jesus.
"And all the fowls were filled with their flesh."

<p>(19:20) <i>"The beast ... and .. the false prophet ... were cast alive into a lake of 
fire burning with brimstone."</i>

<p>(19:21) <b><i>"The remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, 
which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh."</i></b>
