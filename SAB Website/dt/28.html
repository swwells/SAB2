If you don't obey all of the laws in the Old Testament, God shower 
you with the curses that are listed in the next 52 verses.

<p>(28:15) <b><i>"If thou wilt not ... do all his 
commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day ... all these curses shall come upon thee."</i></b>

<p>(28:16) <i>"Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in the field."</i>
(I guess you'll be cursed just about wherever you go.)  

<p><img src="../images/contra1.gif" > (28:18) <i><b>"Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body." </b></i><br>
But other verses claim that children are not to be punished for the sins of their parents.  <br>
