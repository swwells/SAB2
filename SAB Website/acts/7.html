Although in verse 59, Stephen was clearly praying to  Jesus, the NWT tries to give the (false) impression that he was really 
praying to Jehovah by translating "Lord" (kyrios) as "Jehovah". [Then, bending his knees, he cried out with a strong 
voice: "Jehovah, do not charge this sin against them." NWT]
