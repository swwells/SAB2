<img src="../images/pr1.gif" >
<img src="../images/contra1.gif" >(12:1-5) When Jesus and his disciples are accused of breaking the sabbath, he excuses himself by
referring to a scripture in which priests who "profaned the sabbath" were blameless. But there is no such passage in the Old Testament.<br>
<A href="../contra/sabbath.html">Is it necessary to keep the Sabbath?</a><br>
<a href="../contra/alone.html">Was David alone when he asked for the holy bread at Nob?</a>

<p>(12:1) <i>"Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his
    disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat."</i>
    
    <p>(12:2) <i>"But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the 
    sabbath day."</i>
    
    <p>(12:3) <i>"But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was an
    hungred, and they that were with him;"</i>
    
    <p>(12:4) <i>"How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, 
    neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests?"</i>
    
    <p>(12:5) <i>"Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests 
    in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?"</i>
    
    <p><img src="../images/contra1.gif"> (12:7) <i>"I will have mercy, and not sacrifice."</i><br>
    <a href="../contra/desire.html">Does God desire animal sacrifices?</a>
    
    <p><img src="../images/abs1.gif">
    <img src="../images/sci1.gif"> (12:10-13) Jesus heals a withered hand.
    
    <p>(12:10) <i>"There was a man which had his hand withered."</i>
    
    <p>(12:13) <i>"Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other."</i>
    
<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif">
    <img src="../images/sci1.gif"> (12:15) <br><i>"Great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all."</i>
    
    <p><img src="../images/sci1.gif" > (12:22) <i>"Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, 
blind, and dumb: and he healed him."</i> Jesus casts out a devil from a man who was
blind and dumb. (Those who are unable to see or hear are possessed by devils.)

<p><img src="../images/interp.gif"> (12:24) <i>"When the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out
    devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils."</i> This would be a good 
strategy for Beelzebub. Help Jesus (a false prophet/Messiah) 
    cast out devils, so that the people will (mistakenly) believe in him.
    
  <p><img src="../images/int.gif" >
<img src="../images/contra1.gif" > (12:30) <i>"He that is not with me is against me."</i><br>
 <A href="../contra/withme.html">Who is for or against Jesus?</A>
 
 <p><img src="../images/int.gif" >
<img src="../images/contra1.gif" > (12:31-32) The unforgivable sin: blasphemy against the Holy Spirit<br>
<A href="../contra/unforgivable.html">Is there an unforgivable sin?</a>

<p>(12:31) <i>"Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men."</i>

<p>(12:32) <i>"Whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come."</i> 

<p><img src="../images/lang1.gif" >
<img src="../images/int.gif" > (12:34) <i>"O generation of vipers"</i><br>
Jesus often called people names. One of
his favorites was to call his adversaries a &quot;generation of vipers.&quot;

<p><img src="../images/inj1.gif"> (12:36) <i>"Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall
    give account thereof in the day of judgment."</i>
    
    <p><img src="../images/contra1.gif" > (12:37) <i>"By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned."</i><br>
<A href="../contra/words.html">How are people judged by God?</a><br>
<a href="../contra/faithalone.html">Is salvation by faith alone?</a><br>
<a href="../contra/saved.html">What must you do to be saved?</a><br>
<a href="../contra/justified.html">Is anyone justified?</a>

<p><img src="../images/contra1.gif" > (12:39) <i>"An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign."</i><br>
 <A href="../contra/signs.html">Did Jesus perform signs and wonders?</A>
 
 <p><img src="../images/abs1.gif" >
<img src="../images/contra1.gif" > (12:40) <br><i>"Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly."</i><br>
Jesus believed in the literal truth of the
fish story in Jonah. He predicts that he will be &quot;in the
heart of the earth&quot; for three days and three nights. If by this he meant
that he would be in the tomb for three days and three nights, then either he was
mistaken or the gospels are in error. Because according to the gospels (this is
one of the few things they all seem to agree on), Jesus was in the tomb for only
one day and two nights.<br>
<A href="../contra/whale.html">Was Jonah swallowed by a fish or a whale?</a>

<p><img src="../images/contra1.gif" > (12:42) <i>"Behold, a greater than Solomon is here."</i><br>
<a href="../contra/greatest.html">Who was greater: Jesus or Solomon?</a>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif" > (12:43-45) When an unclean spirit (whatever that may
be) leaves a person's body, he goes out to find another. Not finding any, he
comes back with seven other spirits more wicked than himself and repossesses the person.

<p>(12:43) <i>"When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none."</i>

<p>(12:44) <i>"Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished."</i>

<p>(12:45) <i>"Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last 
state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation."</i>

<p><img src="../images/fv.gif" >
<img src="../images/wom1.gif" >
<img src="../images/interp.gif" > (12:47-48) When Jesus' mother and brothers want to see him, Jesus asks, &quot; Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?&quot;&nbsp; 
So much for Jesus' family values. <br>
The fact that Jesus had brothers, though, shows that Mary, contrary to Catholic
teaching, was not always a virgin.<br>
<a href="../contra/parents.html">How should parents be treated?</a>

<p>(12:47) <i>"Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee."</i>

<p>(12:48) <i>"Who is my mother?"</i>
