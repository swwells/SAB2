<IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (8:1-14) <b>The Second Plague: Frogs!</b><br>
Frogs covered the
land. They were all over the beds and filled the ovens. But the Egyptian
magicians did this trick too. (Did they wait until the frogs cleared out from
the last performance before doing it again?) After the frog making contest was
declared a draw, all the frogs died and &quot;they gathered them together upon
heaps; and the land stank.&quot; I bet. But at least it was all for the greater
glory of God.

<p> (8:1-2) <i>"And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him ...  if thou refuse to let them go, behold, 
<b>I will smite all thy borders with frogs."</i></b>

<p>(8:3) <i>"Frogs ... shall ... come into thine house ... and upon thy bed ... and upon thy people, and into thine ovens."</i> 

<p>(8:5) <i>"Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod ... and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt."<i>

<p>(8:6) <i>"And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt."</i>

<p>(8:7) <i>"And the magicians did
    so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt."</i><br>

This is the first trick that the magicians couldn't do. After this the magicians were
convinced that Moses and Aaron's plagues were done by &quot;the finger of
God,&quot; and they gave up trying to match the remaining seven plagues. I guess
lice are harder to make than frogs.

<p>(8:16) <i>"The LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, 
and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt."</i>

<p>(8:17) <i>"Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, 
and in beast."</i>

frogs and lice theme.
