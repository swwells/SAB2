    <img src="../images/pr1.gif"> (4:18)<br> <i>"The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me."</i><br>
    These words were spoken by Isaiah and referred to Isaiah. They were not a prophecy 
    about a future prophet, as Jesus claims here, where he supposedly read these verses in the synagogue while applying 
     them to himself. (See <a href="../is/61.html#1">Isaiah 61:1-2</a>)     
     
     <p>But the verses that Jesus read are not the same as those in Isaiah 61:1-2, which reads: 
     "The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath 
     sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; 
     To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn."
    
    <p>Did Jesus add the part about the blind and bruised to the verses he read from Isaiah? Or did Luke add them later?
