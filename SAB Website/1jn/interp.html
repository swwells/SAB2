<p><li>"He is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also
    for the sins of the whole world."<br>
    <a href="../contra/hell.html">Does Hell exist?</a> <a href="2.html#2">2:2</a>
    
    <p><li>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us."<br>
 Many Christians interpret this verse to mean that it is impossible for a true believer to become an unbeliever. (They become 
 antichrists instead.) <a href="2.html#19">2:19</a>
    
<p><li>"There are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost."
<p>This is the clearest, and pretty much the only, expression of the Trinitarian concept in 
the Bible. It is not, however, found in the earliest Greek manuscripts and is omitted from most 
modern translations. Here, for example, are verses 5:7-8 in the New Revised 
Standard Version:<br>
"There are three that testify: the 
  Spirit and the water and the blood, and these three agree." 
  <p>Not all Christians agree about how these verses (often called 
  the Johannine comma)  should be treated. See <a href="http://av1611.com/kjbp/faq/holland_1jo5_7.html">here</a> for a KJV-only defense.
