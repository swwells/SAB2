Millions of Jaredites kill each other in battle, leaving only their two leaders alive: Coriantumr and Shiz. 
Coriantur cuts of the head of Shiz (with his non-existent sword, of course) and then dies. Don't you 
just love a happy ending?

and fell; and after that he had struggled for breath, he died.</span>

<tr><td><b><a name="33"></a>15:33</b>   And the Lord spake unto Ether, and said unto him: Go forth.   And he went forth, and beheld that the 
words of the Lord had all been fulfilled; and he finished his record; (and the hundredth part I have not written) and 
he hid them in a manner that the people of Limhi did find them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="34"></a>15:34</b>   Now the last words which are written by Ether are these: Whether the Lord will that I be translated, 
or that I suffer the will of the Lord in the flesh, it mattereth not, if it so be that I am saved in the kingdom of 
God.  Amen. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
