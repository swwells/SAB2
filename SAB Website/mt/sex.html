<p><li>Jesus recommends that to avoid sin we cut off our hands and pluck out our eyes. This advice 
is given immediately after he says that anyone who looks with lust at any women commits 
adultery.  <a href="5.html#29">5:29-30</a>

<p><li>"There be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is 
able to receive it, let him receive it." Dangerous words from a guy who recommends
cutting of body parts if they cause you to sin (<A href="5.html#29">Mt 5:29-30</A>,
<A href="18.html#8">18:8-9</A>; <A href="../mk/9.html#43">Mk 9:43-48</A>). It
might make someone castrate himself so that he could be one of the 144,000 male
virgins, who alone will make it to heaven (<A href="../rev/14.html#3">Rev 14:3-4</A>).
 <a href="19.html#12">19:12</a>
 
<p><li>There are no marriages in heaven. (Married people either don't go to heaven or they get divorced 
after arriving there. Marriages aren't made in heaven; they die there.) <a href="22.html#23">22:23-30</a>

<p><li>The kingdom of heaven like ten virgins who went to meet their bridegroom. Five had oil for their lamps and five didn't. 
When the bridegroom was ready for them, only the five well-oiled virgins got to have sex with him on their wedding night. 
The bridegroom shunned the other five, saying "Get lost. I don't even know you." The moral to the story is this: watch out, 
you never know when (or with whom) Jesus will come.<a href="25.html#1">25:1-13</a>
