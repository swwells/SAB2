Jacob's wives and concubines compete to the have the most babies, with God inspecting, opening and closing wombs, as required.

<p>(30:1) <i>"When Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, <b>Give me children or else I die.</b>"</i><br>
Rachel considers herself worthless if she cannot produce children for her
husband.

<p>(30:3) <i>"Behold my maid Bilhah, Go in unto her."</i><br>
But luckily she has an idea. She says to
Jacob, &quot;Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her.&quot; She solved the problem
the same way Sarah did in <A href="16.html#2">16:2</A>.

<p>(30:4-5) <i>"And Jacob went in unto her. And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son."</i> 
(These arrangements seldom produce daughters. See <a href="#21">v. 21</a> for a rare exception.)

<p>(30:7) <i>"And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son."</i>

<p>(30:9) <i>" When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife."</i><br>
Leah, not to be outdone, gives Jacob her maid
(Zilpah) &quot;to wife.&quot; And Zilpah &quot;bare Jacob a son.&quot;

<p>(30:14) <i>"Reuben ... found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. 
Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes."</i>

<p>(Mandrakes are narcotic plants in the Solanaceae family, with many associated superstitious beliefs. Their bulbous roots sometimes 
resemble male sexual organs and were thought to be aphrodisiacs. 
Unfortunately, they only grow where the 
semen of a hanged man falls to the ground, so they are rare nowadays. If you find one, don't dig up the root; if you do, you will be instantly 
killed by its scream.)

<p>(30:15) <i>"Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes."</i><br>
Rachel trades sex with her husband for Leah's mandrakes.

<p>(30:16) <i>"Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, 
<b>Thou  must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes.</b> And he lay with her that night."</i>

Leah thinks her husband will honor her now that she has given him six sons.

<p>(30:22-23) <i>"God remembered Rachel, and ... opened her womb. And she conceived, and bare a son;"</i><br>
And finally, "God remembered Leah (He probably said something like, "Oh yeah, she's the one with the really cool mandrakes.") and 
opened her womb. And she conceived, and bare a son (Surprise, surprise)."

(30:37-39) <br>
Jacob displays his (and God's) knowledge
of biology by having goats copulate while looking at streaked rods. The result
is streaked, speckled, and spotted baby goats. (Goats are "cattle" in the King James Version.)

<p>(30:37) <i>"Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white
    strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods."</i>
    
<p>(30:38) <i>"And he set the rods ... before the flocks ... when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to
    drink."</i>
    
<p>(30:39) <i>"And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled,
    and spotted."</i>

    hand of his sons.
