<p><li>To commemorate the divine massacre of the Egyptian children, Moses instructs the Israelites to "sacrifice to the
Lord all that openeth the matrix" -- all the males, that is. God has no use for dead, burnt female bodies.  
<a href="13.html#2">13:2, 12, 15</a>

<p><li>Moses, like a coach giving instructions to the team before the big game, tells the men to "come not at your wives" before
he goes up to Mt. Sinai.  <a href="19.html#15">19:15</a>

<p><li>"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, ... nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbor's." In the Bible, women are the
property of men; they are his possessions -- like an ox or an ass. <a href="20.html#17">20:17</a>

<p><li>How to sell your daughter -- and what to do if she fails to please her new master. 
<a href="21.html#7">21:7-8</a>

<p><li>God's instructions for taking a second wife.  <a href="21.html#10">21:10</a>

<p><li>If you "entice" an "unmarried maid" to "lie" with you, then you must marry her, unless the father refuses to give her to you,
in which case you must pay him the going price for virgins.  <a href="22.html#16">22:16</a>

<p><li>"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live." Thousands of innocent women have suffered excruciating deaths because of this
verse.  <a href="22.html#18">22:18</a>

<p><li>Three times a year God wants to see all of the males. The females he never wants to see. <a href="23.html#17">23:17</a>

<p><li>"Their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods." God always blames the
women; it is they who "go a whoring" and then "make" the men "go a whoring."  <a href="34.html#16">34:16</a>

<p><li>"Thrice in the year shall all your men children appear before the Lord." But what about the "women children"? Don't they
ever get to appear before the Lord?  <a href="34.html#23">34:23</a>
