<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="1">1</b></a>
Praise be to Allah Who hath revealed the Scripture unto His slave, and hath  not placed therein any crookedness, <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="2">2</b></a>
(But hath made it) straight, to give warning of stern punishment from Him,  and to bring unto the believers who do good works the news that theirs will be a fair  reward, <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="3">3</b></a>
Wherein they will abide for ever; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="4">4</b></a>
And to warn those who say: Allah hath chosen a son, <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="5">5</b></a>
(A thing) whereof they have no knowledge, nor (had) their fathers, Dreadful  is the word that cometh out of their mouths. They speak naught but a lie. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="6">6</b></a>

Yet it may be, if they believe not in this statement, that thou (Muhammad)  wilt torment thy soul with grief over their footsteps. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="7">7</b></a>
Lo! We have placed all that is on the earth as an ornament thereof that We  may try them: which of them is best in conduct. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="8">8</b></a>
And lo! We shall make all that is thereon a barren mound. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="9">9</b></a>
Or deemest thou that the People of the Cave and the Inscription are a wonder  among Our portents ? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="10">10</b></a>
When the young men fled for refuge to the Cave and said: Our Lord! Give us  mercy from Thy presence, and shape for us right conduct in our plight. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="11">11</b></a>
Then We sealed up their hearing in the Cave for a number of years. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="12">12</b></a>
And afterward We raised them up that We might know which of the two  parties would best calculate the time that they had tarried. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="13">13</b></a>
We narrate unto thee their story with truth. Lo! they were young men who  believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="14">14</b></a>
And We made firm their hearts when they stood forth and said: Our Lord is  the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We cry unto no God beside Him, for then  should we utter an enormity. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="15">15</b></a>
These, our people, have chosen (other) gods beside Him though they bring  no clear 
warrant (vouchsafed) to them. And <span class="i">who doth greater wrong than he who  
inventeth a lie concerning Allah ?</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/inj1.gif" border="0" width="32" height="32"><br>
<font size="-1">The worst thing you can do is to "invent lies about Allah.".</font>

<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="16">16</b></a>
And when ye withdraw from them and that which they worship except Allah,  then seek refuge in the Cave; your Lord will spread for you of His mercy and will  prepare for you a pillow in your plight. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="17">17</b></a>
And thou mightest have seen the sun when it rose move away from their  cave to the right, and when it set go past them on the left, and they were in the cleft  thereof. That was (one) of the portents of Allah. He whom Allah guideth, he indeed is  led aright, and he whom He sendeth astray, for him thou wilt not find a guiding  friend. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="18">18</b></a>
And thou wouldst have deemed them waking though they were asleep, and  We caused them to turn over to the right and the left, and their dog stretching out his  paws on the threshold. If thou hadst observed them closely thou hadst assuredly  turned away from them in flight, and hadst been filled with awe of them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="19">19</b></a>
And in like manner We awakened them that they might question one another.  A speaker from among them said: How long have ye tarried ? They said: We have   tarried a day or some part of a day, (Others) said: Your Lord best knoweth what ye  have tarried. Now send one of you with this your silver coin unto the city, and let him  see what food is purest there and bring you a supply thereof. Let him be courteous  and let no man know of you. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="20">20</b></a>
For they, if they should come to know of you, will stone you or turn you  back to their religion; then ye will never prosper. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="21">21</b></a>
And in like manner We disclosed them (to the people of the city) that they  might know that the promise of Allah is true, and that, as for the Hour, there is no  doubt concerning it. When (the people of the city) disputed of their case among  themselves, they said: Build over them a building; their Lord knoweth best  concerning them. Those who won their point said: We verily shall build a place of  worship over them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="22">22</b></a>
(Some) will say: They were three, their dog the fourth, and (some) say: Five,  their dog the sixth, guessing at random; and (some) say: Seven, and their dog the  eighth. Say (O Muhammad): My Lord is Best Aware of their number. None knoweth  them save a few. So contend not concerning them except with an outward contending,  and ask not any of them to pronounce concerning them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="23">23</b></a>
And say not of anything: Lo! I shall do that tomorrow, <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="24">24</b></a>

Except if Allah will. And remember thy Lord when thou forgettest, and say:  It may be that my Lord guideth me unto a nearer way of truth than this. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="25">25</b></a>
And (it is said) they tarried in their Cave three hundred years and add nine. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="26">26</b></a>
Say: Allah is Best Aware how long they tarried. His is the Invisible of the  heavens and the earth. 
How clear of sight is He and keen of hearing! They have no  protecting friend beside Him, 
and <span class="i">He maketh none to share in His government.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1"><i>He maketh none to share in His government."</i><br>
Democracy is heresy. Allah shares his government with no one.</font>

<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="27">27</b></a>
And <span class="c">recite that which hath been revealed unto thee of the Scripture of thy  Lord. There 
is none who can change His words</span>, and thou wilt find no refuge beside  Him. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

Restrain thyself along with those who cry unto their Lord at morn and  evening, seeking His Countenance; and let not thine eyes overlook them, desiring the  pomp of the life of the world; and obey not him whose heart We have made heedless  of Our remembrance, who followeth his own lust and whose case hath been  abandoned. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="29">29</b></a>

and whosoever will, let him disbelieve.</span> Lo! <span class="v">We have prepared for

Lo! as for those who believe and do good works - Lo! We suffer not the  reward of one 
whose work is goodly to be lost. 
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="31">31</b></a>
As for such, theirs will be Gardens of Eden, wherein rivers flow beneath  them; therein 
they will be given armlets of gold and will wear green robes of finest  silk and gold 
embroidery, reclining upon throne therein. Blest the reward, and fair the  resting-place! <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="32">32</b></a>
Coin for them a similitude: Two men, unto one of whom We had assigned  two gardens of 
grapes, and We had surrounded both with date-palms and had put  between them tillage. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="33">33</b></a>

Each of the gardens gave its fruit and withheld naught thereof. And We  caused a river to gush forth therein. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="34">34</b></a>
And he had fruit. And he said unto his comrade, when he spake with him: I  am more than thee in wealth, and stronger in respect of men. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="35">35</b></a>
And he went into his garden, while he (thus) wronged himself. He said: I  think not that all this will ever perish. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="36">36</b></a>
I think not that the Hour will ever come, and if indeed I am brought back  unto my Lord I surely shall find better than this as a resort. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="37">37</b></a>
His comrade, when he (thus) spake with him, exclaimed: Disbelievest thou in  Him Who created thee of dust, then of a drop (of seed), and then fashioned thee a man  ? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="38">38</b></a>
But He is Allah, my Lord, and I ascribe unto my Lord no partner. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="39">39</b></a>
If only, when thou enteredst thy garden, thou hadst said: That which Allah  willeth (will come to pass)! There is no strength save in Allah! Though thou seest me  as less than thee in wealth and children, <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="40">40</b></a>
Yet it may be that my Lord will give me better than thy garden, and will send  on it a bolt from heaven, and some morning it will be a smooth hillside, <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="41">41</b></a>
Or some morning the water thereof will be lost in the earth so that thou canst  not make search for it. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="42">42</b></a>

And his fruit was beset (with destruction). Then began he to wring his hands  for all that he had spent upon it, when (now) it was all ruined on its trellises, and to  say: Would that I had ascribed no partner to my Lord! <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="43">43</b></a>
And he had no troop of men to help him as against Allah, nor could he save  himself. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="44">44</b></a>
In this case is protection only from Allah, the True, He is Best for reward,  and best for consequence. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="45">45</b></a>
And coin for them the similitude of the life of the world as water which We  send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingleth with it and then  becometh dry twigs that the winds scatter. Allah is able to do all things. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="46">46</b></a>
Wealth and children are an ornament of the life of the world. But the good  deeds which endure are better in thy Lord's sight for reward, and better in respect of  hope. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="47">47</b></a>
And (bethink you of) the Day when we remove the hills and ye see the earth  emerging, and We gather them together so as to leave not one of them behind. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="48">48</b></a>
And they are set before thy Lord in ranks (and it is said unto them): Now  verily have ye come unto Us as We created you at the first. But ye thought that We  had set no tryst for you. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="49">49</b></a>
And the Book is placed, and thou seest the guilty fearful of that which is  therein, and they say: What kind of a Book is this that leaveth not a small thing nor a  great thing but hath counted it! And they find all that they did confronting them, and  thy Lord wrongeth no-one. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>18:<a NAME="50">50</b></a>
<span class="c">And (remember) when We said unto the angels: Fall prostrate before Adam,  and they fell 
prostrate, all save Iblis. He was of the jinn</span>, so he rebelled against his  Lord's command. Will ye choose him and his seed for your 
protecting friends instead  of Me, when they are an enemy unto you ? Calamitous is the exchange for evil-doers. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
