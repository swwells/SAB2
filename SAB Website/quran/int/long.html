<p><li>"Show us the straight path, The path of those whom Thou hast favoured; Not the (path) of those who  earn Thine anger nor 
of those who go astray."</i><br>
Muslims generally interpret "those whom Allah has favored," "those who earn Allah's anger," and "those who go astray" as Muslims, Jews, and Christians, 
respectively.

<p><li>Don't bother warning the disbelievers. Allah has made it impossible for them to 
believe so that he can torture them forever after they die. <a href="../2/index.htm#6">2:6-7</a>

<p><li>Allah has sickened the hearts of disbelievers and increased their disease. He is a spiritual anti-doctor. 
<a href="../2/index.htm#10">2:10</a> 
 
<p><li>Allah has blinded the disbelievers. "Allah taketh away their light and leaveth them in darkness, where they cannot see, 
 Deaf, dumb and blind." <a href="../2/index.htm#17">2:17-18</a>

<p><li>If you try to compose a surah that is better than those in the Quran, and then fail, Allah will burn you forever if you in the 
fire that he has prepared for disbelievers, whose fuel is men and stones. <a href="../2/index.htm#24">2:24</a>

<<p><li>They who disbelieve, and deny Our revelations, such are rightful Peoples of the Fire. They will abide therein." 
<a href="../2/index.htm#39">2:39</a>

<p><li>Allah stamped wretchedness upon the Jews because they killed the prophets 
and disbelieved Allah's revelations. <a href="../2/index.htm#61">2:61</a>

<p><li>Allah turned Sabbath-breaking Jews into apes to be despised and hated. All modern Jews are descendants of apes 
(or all modern apes are descendants of Sabbath-breaking Jews). <a href="../2/index.htm#65">2:65-66</a>

<p><li>Christians and Jews (who believe in only part of the Scripture), will suffer in this life and go to hell in the next. 
<a href="../2/index.htm#85">2:85</a>

<p><li>"Allah has cursed them for their unbelief."<br>
Because I disbelieve in his bullshit, Allah has cursed me, along with nearly six billion other non-Muslims. <a href="../2/index.htm#88">2:88</a>

<p><li>The curse of Allah is on disbelievers. <a href="../2/index.htm#89">2:89</a>

<p><li>"They have incurred anger upon anger. For disbelievers is a shameful doom." <a href="../2/index.htm#90">90</a>

<p><li>Jews are the greediest of all humankind. They'd like to live 1000 years. But even that "would by no means remove the doom." 
<a href="../2/index.htm#96">2:96</a> 
 
<p><li>Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers. <a href="../2/index.htm#98">2:98</a>

<p><li>Allah has revealed "clear tokens." Only evil people are disbelievers. <a href="../2/index.htm#99">2:99</a>

<p><li>"For disbelievers is a painful doom." <a href="../2/index.htm#104">2:104</a>

<p><li>Don't question anything Muhammed says or choose disbelief over faith. <a href="../2/index.htm#108">2:108</a> 

<p><li>The Jews and Christians know damn well that the Muslims are right, so they try to make Muslims disbelievers because they envy the 
truth that they know the Muslims have. <a href="../2/index.htm#109">2:109</a>

<p><li>"But those who keep their duty to 
Allah will be above them [non-muslims] on the  Day of Resurrection." <a href="../2/index.htm#212">2:212</a> 

<p><li>Allah will make disbelievers' lives miserable in this world and torture them forever after they die.
<a href="../2/index.htm#114">2:114</a>

<p><li>"And thou wilt not be asked about the owners of hell-fire." (They are the non-muslims.) 
<a href="../2/index.htm#119">2:119</a> 

<p><li>Disbelievers are losers. <a href="../2/index.htm#121">2:121</a>

<p><li>Allah will leave the disbelievers alone for a while, but then he
 will compel them to the doom of Fire. <a href="../2/index.htm#126">2:126</a>
 
<p><li>"Who forsaketh the religion of Abraham save him who befooleth himself?"</i><br>
Cited in the <a href="http://www.palestinecenter.org/cpap/documents/charter.html">Hamas Charter</a> (Article 27) to condemn the 
idea of a secular state. <a href="../2/index.htm#130">2:130</a> 
 
<p><li>Allah will curse those who "hide the proofs and the guidance" that he revealed. But how can you hide things that don't exist? 
There are no proofs anywhere in the Quran and whatever guidance is there is almost always bad. <a href="../2/index.htm#159">2:159</a> 

<p><li>Those who disbelieve in the Quran, for whatever reason, are cursed by Allah, the angels, and men combined. So every good 
Muslim must join Allah and the angels in cursing nonbelievers. <a href="../2/index.htm#161">2:161</a> 

<p><li>The doom of the disbelievers will not be lightened. <a href="../2/index.htm#162">2:162</a> 

<p><li>"Those who disbelieve [are] Deaf, dumb, blind, therefore they have no sense." <a href="../2/index.htm#171">2:171</a>

<p><li>Those who hide the Scripture will have their bellies eaten with fire. Theirs 
will be a painful doom. <a href="../2/index.htm#174">2:174</a>

<p><li>How constant are they in their strife to reach the Fire! <a href="../2/index.htm#175">2:175</a>

<p><li> If someone murders your slave, then you get to kill one of his. If it was a male that was killed, you kill one of the killer's male slaves. 
If a female, you kill a female. Murder for murder. Slave for slave. It all works out swell with Allah's wondrous rules. (Oh, and if you 
don't follow them, you'll have the usual painful doom.)  <a href="../2/index.htm#178">2:178</a>
 
<p><li>Kill disbelievers wherever you find them. If they attack you, then kil them. 
Such is the reward of disbelievers. (But if they desist in their 
unbelief, then don't kill them.) <a href="../2/index.htm#191">2:191-2</a>

<p><li>Allah says that you must keep fighting until there is no more persecution and everyone on earth is a Muslim. 
Then you can stop killing people. <a href="../2/index.htm#193">2:193a</a>

<p><li>But if there are any wrong-doers around after you've killed off all the disbelievers, persecutors and aggressors, 
then you'll have to kill them too. <a href="../2/index.htm#193">2:193b</a>

<p><li>Those who fail in their duty to Allah are proud and sinful. They will all go to hell. 
<a href="../2/index.htm#206">2:206</a> 

<p><li>"But those who keep their duty to Allah will be above them [non-muslims] on the  Day of Resurrection." 
<a href="../2/index.htm#212">2:212</a> 

<p><li>War is ordained by Allah, and all Muslims must be willing to fight, whether
they like it or not. <a href="../2/index.htm#216">2:216</a> 

<p><li>It's you and your religion against them and theirs. They won't stop fighting until they make you a "renegade from your religion" 
and if they succeed in that so you die in disbelief, Allah will burn you forever in the Fire. <a href="../2/index.htm#217">2:217</a>
 
<p><li>Intermarriage is forbidden. <a href="../2/index.htm#221">2:221</a>

<p><li>"The disbelievers, they are the wrong-doers." <a href="../2/index.htm#254">2:254</a> 

<p><li>Disbelievers worship false gods. The will burn forever in the Fire.
 <a href="../2/index.htm#257">2:257</a>
 
<p><li>Allah does not guide disbelievers. <a href="../2/index.htm#264">2:264</a>

<p><li>"Give us victory over the disbelieving folk." <a href="../2/index.htm#286">2:286</a>

 believers. <a href="../3/index.htm#28">3:28</a> 
 
 <p><li>Allah loveth  not the disbelievers. <a href="../3/index.htm#32">3:32</a> 
 
 <p><li>Allah will punish disbelievers in this world and the next. They will have 
no helpers. <a href="../3/index.htm#56">3:56</a>

<p><li>Don't believe anyone who is not a Muslim. <a href="../3/index.htm#73">3:73</a>

<p><li>"Allah will neither speak to them nor look upon them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He make them grow. 
 Theirs will be a painful doom." <a href="../3/index.htm#77">3:77</a>
 
 <p><li>All non-Muslims will be rejected by Allah after they die. <a href="../3/index.htm#85">3:85</a>
 
<p><li>Apostates will be cursed by Allah, angels, and men. They will have a painful doom.
  <a href="../3/index.htm#87">3:86-88</a>
  
 <p><li>Disbelievers will have a painful doom. And they will have no helpers. 
 <a href="../3/index.htm#91">3:91</a>
 
<p><li>Disbelievers will have their faces blackened on the last day. They will face an awful 
 doom. <a href="../3/index.htm#105">3:105-6</a> 
 
<p><li>Why does Allah like Muslims so much? Because they are the best people on earth, they behave themselves, forbid indecency, 
 and believe in Allah. Allah loves people who believe in him. (Most Non-muslims are "evil-livers.") <a href="../3/index.htm#110">3:110</a> 
  
 <p><li>Those who disbelieve will be burnt in the Fire. <a href="../3/index.htm#116">3:116</a>

<p><li>Those who disobey Allah and his messenger will be burnt with 
fire and suffer a painful doom. <a href="../4/index.htm#14">4:14</a>

<p><li>For the disbelievers and those who make a last-minute conversion, Allah has prepared a painful doom. <a href="../4/index.htm#18">
4:18</a>
<p><li>For disbelievers, We prepare a shameful doom. <a href="../4/index.htm#37">4:37</a>

<p><li>Those who ...believe not in Allah nor the Last Day" will face a shameful doom. <a href="../4/index.htm#38">4:38</a>

<p><li>"Allah knoweth best (who are) your enemies." <a href="../4/index.htm#45">4:45</a> 

<p><li>"Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe not." <a href="../4/index.htm#46">4:46</a> 

<p><li>Christians and Jews must believe what Allah has revealed to Muhammad or Allah will disfigure their faces or
turn them into apes, as he did the Sabbath-breakers. (See 
<a href="../2/index.htm#65">2:65-66</a>) <a href="../4/index.htm#47">4:47</a>

<p><li>Those who ascribe a partner to Allah (like Christians do with Jesus and the 
Holy Spirit) will not be forgiven. They have "invented a tremendous sin."
 <a href="../4/index.htm#48">4:48</a>, <a href="../4/index.htm#116">4:116</a>

 <p><li>Allah curses those that invent lies about him, believe in idols and false deities, claim to be more rightly guided, 
 or whatnot (like the Christians and Jews). <a href="../4/index.htm#50">4:50-52</a> 
 
<p><li>Apostates are going to hell. <a href="../4/index.htm#55">4:55</a>

<p><li>Unbelievers will be tormented forever with fire. When their skin is burned off, 
a fresh skin will be provided. <a href="../4/index.htm#56">4:56</a>

<p><li>Oppose those that refuse to obey. <a href="../4/index.htm#60">4:60-63</a>

 <p><li>The hypocrites refuse to die for Allah and Muhammad. <a href="../4/index.htm#66">4:66</a>
 
 <p><li>Those who obey Allah and Muhammad
  are favored by Allah. They are the best company. <a href="../4/index.htm#69">4:69</a>
  
<p><li>Allah will bestow a vast reward on those who fight in religious wars.
 <a href="../4/index.htm#74">4:74</a>
 
<p><li>Believers fight for Allah; disbelievers fight for the devil. So fight the 
minions of the devil. <a href="../4/index.htm#76">4:76</a>

<a href="../4/index.htm#80">4:80</a>

<p><li>"So fight (O Muhammad) in the way of Allah ... Allah will restrain the might of those who disbelieve."<br>
So fight for Allah. Allah will always rig the battle so that Muslims will defeat non-Muslims. <a href="../4/index.htm#84">4:84</a>

<p><li>Allah casts the hypocrites back to disbelief. Don't try to guide those that Allah 
sends astray. <a href="../4/index.htm#88">4:88</a>

<a href="../4/index.htm#89">4:89</a>

<p><li>If the unbelievers do not offer you peace, kill them wherever 
you find them. Against such you are given clear warrant. <a href="../4/index.htm#91">4:91</a>

<p><li>Believers shouldn't kill believers, unless by mistake. If you kill a believer 
by mistake, you must set free a believing slave. <a href="../4/index.htm#92">4:92</a>

<p><li>Believers who kill believers will go to hell. <a href="../4/index.htm#93">4:93</a>

<p><li>After non-Muslims die, they will make excuses for their unbelief -- like saying that they were oppressed. Then the angels 
will ask them, "Why didn't you move to another country?" But the angels won't wait for an answer. They'll just take them all to 
hell. <a href="../4/index.htm#97">4:97</a> 

<p><li>The disbelievers are an open enemy to you. <a href="../4/index.htm#101">4:101</a>

<p><li>For the disbelievers, Allah has prepared a shameful punishment. <a href="../4/index.htm#102">4:102</a>

<p><li>Relent not in pursuit of the enemy. They have no hope from Allah. 
<a href="../4/index.htm#104">4:104</a>

<p><li>"Plead not on behalf of (people) who deceive themselves. Lo! Allah loveth not one who is treacherous and sinful." 
<a href="../4/index.htm#107">4:107</a>

<p><li>Those who oppose the messenger and become unbelievers will go to hell. 
<a href="../4/index.htm#115">4:115</a>

<p><li>They (those who ascribe partners to Allah) invoke in his stead 
only females and pray to Satan. <a href="../4/index.htm#117">4:117</a>

<p><li>Allah will lead them astray, arouse desires in them, and they will go to hell. <a href="../4/index.htm#119">4:119-121</a>
 
<p><li>Those who believe, then disbelieve, then believe and disbelieve again will 
never be forgiven by Allah. <a href="../4/index.htm#137">4:137</a>

<p><li>For the hypocrites there will be a painful doom. <a href="../4/index.htm#138">4:138</a>

<p><li>Stay away from nonbelievers who mock your beliefs or Allah will treat you like them. (He'll torture you forever in hell after you die.) 
<a href="../4/index.htm#140">4:140a</a>

<p><li>Allah will gather hypocrites and disbelievers into hell. 
<a href="../4/index.htm#140">4:140b</a>

<p><li>Allah will not allow disbelievers to succeed against believers. 
<a href="../4/index.htm#141">4:141</a>

<p><li>Do not choose disbelievers as friends. <a href="../4/index.htm#144">4:144</a>

<p><li>The hypocrites will be in the lowest part of hell and no one will help 
them there. <a href="../4/index.htm#145">4:145</a>

<p><li>You must believe everything Allah and his messengers tell you.
Those who don't are disbelievers and will face a painful doom. 
<a href="../4/index.htm#150">4:150-151</a>

<p><li>For the wrongdoing Jews, Allah has prepared a painful doom. 
<a href="../4/index.htm#160">4:160-1</a>
