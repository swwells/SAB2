<tr><td><b><a name="23">28:23</a></b>   <span class="a">It came to pass</span> that thus they did go forth among all the 
people of Nephi, and did preach the gospel of Christ unto all people upon the face of the land; and 
they were converted unto the Lord, and were united unto the church of Christ, and thus the people of 
that generation were blessed, according to the word of Jesus. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24">28:24</a></b>   And now I, Mormon, make an end of speaking concerning these things for a time. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25">28:25</a></b>   Behold, I was about to write the names of those who were never to taste of death, but 
the Lord forbade; therefore I write them not, for they are hid from the world. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26">28:26</a></b>   But behold, I have seen them, and they have ministered unto me. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27">28:27</a></b>   And behold they will be among the Gentiles, and the Gentiles shall know them not. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="28">28:28</a></b>   They will also be among the Jews, and the Jews shall know them not. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="29">28:29</a></b> <span class="a">And it shall come to pass</span>, when the Lord seeth fit in his wisdom that they shall 
minister unto all the scattered tribes of Israel, and unto <span class="plag">all nations, kindreds, tongues and 
people</span>, and shall bring out of them unto Jesus many souls, that their desire may be fulfilled, and 
also because of the convincing power of God which is in them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

there was a change wrought upon them, insomuch that Satan could have no power over them, that he 
could not tempt them; and they were sanctified in the flesh, that they were holy, and that the 
powers of the earth could not hold them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="40">28:40</a></b>   And in this state they were to remain until the judgment day of Christ; and at that

no more out, but to dwell eternally in the heavens. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
