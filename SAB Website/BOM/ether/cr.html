<p><li>"He that will contend against the word of the Lord, let him be accursed; and he that shall deny these 
things, let him be accursed."<br>
(Those who disbelieve in the Book of Mormon will go to hell.) <a href="4.html#8">4:8</a>

<p><li>"At my command the inhabitants thereof shall pass away, even so as by fire."<br>
(If he feels like it, God can burn people to death.) <a href="4.html#9">4:9</a>

<p><li>"He that believeth not shall be damned." <a href="4.html#18">4:18</a>

<p><li>Avoid all those secret, abominable, murderous, wicked oaths and combinations passed down since the 
time of Cain. If you don't, God will have to kill you. <a href="8.html#15">8:15-24</a>

<p><li>"Saith the Lord: I will pour out the fulness of my wrath." <a href="9.html#20">9:20</a>

<p><li>"There came forth poisonous serpents also upon the face of the land, and did poison many people." 
<a href="9.html#31">9:31</a>

<p><li>To punish the people for "their wicked combinations," God sent wars, famines, and pestilences. The resulting 
 destruction was the greatest ever seen on the face of the earth -- greater than the flood of Noah, the 
 destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, or World War II.  Yet there is no evidence 
	for any of this today. <a href="11.html#7">11:7</a>
	
<p><li>The prophets prophesied "that the Lord would utterly destroy them from off the face of the earth." 
<a href="11.html#12">11:12</a>

<p><li>"The Lord did visit them in the fulness of his wrath ... for their everlasting destruction."
 <a href="14.html#25">14:25</a>

<p><li>Millions of Jaredites kill each other in battle, leaving only their two leaders alive: Coriantumr and Shiz. 
Coriantur cuts of the head of Shiz (with his non-existent sword, of course) and then dies. Don't you 
just love a happy ending? <a href="15.html#30">15:30-32</a>
