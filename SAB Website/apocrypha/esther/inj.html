<p><li> Because of Vashti's disobedience, the king decrees that " all wives ... give honour to their husbands" 
and "the husbands should be rulers and masters in their houses." <a href="1.html#20">1:20-22</a>

<p><li>With nothing more than suspicion and hearsay, Esther has two men hanged (after a brief inquisition). <a href="2.html#21">2:21-23</a>

<p><li>Without a trial, Esther has Haman hung. <a href="7.html#6">7:6-10</a>

<p><li>After hanging Haman at Esther's request, the king gave Esther (and her buddy Mordecai) Haman's ring and house. <a href="8.html#1">8:1-7</a>

<p><li> (8:11-13) At Esther's request, the king orders a preemptive strike on all 127 provinces from India to Ethiopia. Everyone who planned to kill Jews shall be killed by Jews, along with their wives and children. 
And all this killing is to take place on a single day -- the day after the first decree ordered all the Jews to be killed. <a href="8.html#11">8:11-13</a>

<p><li>On the day when all Jew-haters (and their families) were killed by Jews. The Jews had  "a new light"  and and "joy, and honour, and dancing." <a href="8.html#16">8:16-17a</a>

<p><li>"Many ... joined themselves to their worship and ceremonies. For a great dread of the name of the Jews had fallen upon all."<br>
God's favorite way of making converts: Convert or be killed! <a href="8.html#17">8:17b</a>

<p><li>The Jews kill everyone who ever had a bad thought about them, along with their Jew-hating families. <a href="9.html#1">9:1-6</a>

<p><li>Esther asks the king to kill all those who planned to kill the Jews and hang the already dead bodies of Aman's ten sons on trees. <a href="9.html#12">9:12-14</a>

<p><li>The Jews killed 75,300 men, along with their wives and children. Then had a big party to celebrate the slaughter. (This is the origin of the Jewish festival of Purim.) <a href="9.html#15">9:15-22</a>

<p><li>"Esther went in to the king, beseeching him ... And so both he and his sons were hanged upon gibbets." <a href="9.html#25">9:25</a>

<p><li> "God hath done these things."<br>
The apocrypha to the rescue! The original (Hebrew) book of Esther was completely godless, so the genocides arranged by Esther and Mordecai 
(Mardochai in the Douay-Rheims) could not be attributed to God. But the first line of the apocryphal text takes care of that: "God hath done all these things." 
(Who else would be so damned nasty?) <a href="10.html#4">10:4</a>

<p><li> "The Lord remembered his people." <br>
(By having them murder thousands of people.) <a href="10.html#10">10:10</a>

<p><li>"The nation of the just ... cried to God ... and they devoured the glorious."<br>
"The nation of the just" is, of course, the Jews. They cry to God and God helps them kill everyone else. <a href="11.html#9">11:9-11</a>

<p><li>"What God would do?"<br>
(He would help the Jews kill non-Jews.) <a href="11.html#12">11:12</a>

<p><li>Esther calls upon God and God softens the king's heart (so that he'd murder thousands of non-Jews). <a href="15.html#3">15:3-11</a>

<p><li>The king decrees that Haman and his family shall hang; that everyone in the kingdom who wanted to kill the Jews shall be killed; that whoever refuses 
to kill the people that wanted to kill Jews will be killed by sword and fire; and that everyone will celebrate the killing of the wannabe Jew killers forever. <a href="16.html#10">16:10-18</a>
