<p><li>"A bishop must be ... the husband of one wife." Apparently, it's OK for laymen to have 
several. <a href="3.html#2">3:2</a>

<p><li>You should help a widow only if she: has no children or nephews; 
is desolate, trusts in God, and prays all the time; is not living in pleasure (a widow living in pleasure is the living dead); 
is over 60 years old; had only one husband; has raised children; has lodged strangers; has washed the saints' feet; has relieved 
the afflicted; and has diligently followed every good work. <a href="5.html#3">5:3-10</a>

<p><li>Never help a young widow (one under 60 years old). When they wax wanton against Christ, they'll get 
married, and be damned to hell for rejecting their faith. Besides, young widows are idle busybodies, wandering around from house to house saying 
things they shouldn't say. They should get married and have children (though 
they'll be damned to hell for it). Heck, some of them have already turned aside after Satan. <a href="5.html#11">5:11-15</a>
