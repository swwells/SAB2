<p><li>Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. -- <a href='../gen/3.html#16' > 3:16</a>
<p><li>Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, an do ye to them as is good in your eyes. -- <a href='../gen/19.html#8' > 19:8</a>
<p><li>Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father -- <a href='../gen/19.html#32' > 19:32</a>
<p><li>And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose -- <a href='../gen/19.html#33' > 19:33</a>
<p><li>Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father -- <a href='../gen/19.html#34' > 19:34</a>
<p><li>And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose -- <a href='../gen/19.html#35' > 19:35</a>
<p><li>Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. -- <a href='../gen/19.html#36' > 19:36</a>
<p><li>And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes. -- <a href='../gen/30.html#15' > 30:15</a>
<p><li>Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night. -- <a href='../gen/30.html#16' > 30:16</a>

<p><li>And if any man lie with her at all, and her flowers be upon him, he  shall be unclean seven days; and all the bed whereon he lieth shall be  unclean.--<a href='../lev/15.html#24' >15:24</a>
<p><li>Thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.--<a href='../lev/18.html#19' >18:19</a>
<p><li>And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid,  betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she  shall be scourged.--<a href='../lev/19.html#20' >19:20</a>
<p><li>And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely  be put to death.--<a href='../lev/20.html#12' >20:12</a>
<p><li>If a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they  shall be burnt with fire, both he and they.--<a href='../lev/20.html#14' >20:14</a>
<p><li>If a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto thou  shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their  blood shall be upon them.--<a href='../lev/20.html#16' >20:16</a>
<p><li>And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall  uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath  uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from  among their people.--<a href='../lev/20.html#18' >20:18</a>

<p><li>If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her ....--<a href='../dt/22.html#13' >22:13</a>
<p><li>I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not  a maid. Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring  forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity unto the elders of the city.--<a href='../dt/22.html#14' >22:14-15</a>
<p><li>These are the tokens of my daughter's  virginity.--<a href='../dt/22.html#17' >22:18-21</a>
<p><li>But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found  for the damsel: Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's  house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die.--<a href='../dt/22.html#20' >22:20-21</a>
<p><li>If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man  find her in the city, and lie with her; Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye  shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried  not, being in the city.--<a href='../dt/22.html#23' >22:23-24</a>

<p><li>Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her.--<a href='../dt/28.html#30' >28:30</a>
<p><li>The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure  to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her  son, and toward her daughter, and toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and  toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them.--<a href='../dt/28.html#56' >28:56-57</a>

<h4>Judges</h4>
<p><li>Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be .... She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's  hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when  she had pierced and stricken through his temples.--<a href='../jg/5.html#24' >5:24-26</a>
<p><li>Have they not divided the prey; to every man a  damsel or two?--<a href='../jg/5.html#30' >5:30</a>
<p><li>Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will  bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto  you.--<a href='../jg/19.html#24' >19:24</a>

<p><li>Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the  king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.--<a href='../1sam/18.html#27' >18:27</a>
