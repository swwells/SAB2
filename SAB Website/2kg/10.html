 (10.15) <i>"When he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab … coming to meet him … 
and said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thine hand. And he 
gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot."</i><br>
After meeting with Ahaziah’s family (and killing them all), Jehu got into his chariot and drove away furiously toward Samaria. On his way, 
he ran across his old friend, Jehonadab. Jehu asked him, “Is your heart true to mine as mine is to yours?” And Jehonadab said, “It is.” 
(They were very good friends.)

(10:16) <b><i>"Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD."</b></i><br>
When Jehonadab and Jehu were finally alone, Jehu said, "Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD." Then the two men, whose hearts 
were true to each other, rode off into the sunset toward Samaria.

Jehu lied to the followers of Baal so that he could trap and kill them.

    Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much ... Call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and
    all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice to do to
    Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live."</i>
    
<p> (10:19b) <i>"But Jehu did it in subtilty ... that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal."</i>
    
    <p>(10:20) <i>"Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal."</i>
    
    <p>(10:21) <i>"Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. 
    And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another."</i>
    
    <p>(20:24) <i>"And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed
    fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands
    escape, he that letteth him go, his life shall be for the life of him."</i>

  And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at the

  <tr><td><B><A name="13">10:13</A></B>
  Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are ye?
    And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute
    the children of the king and the children of the queen.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="14">10:14</A></B>
  And he said, <span class="v">Take them

    right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it
    be, give me thine hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him

  <span class="v">And when he came to

  <tr><td><B><A name="19">10:19</A></B>
  Now therefore <span class="i">call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and

    Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in

  <tr><td><B><A name="20">10:20</A></B>
  And <span class="i">Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal.</span> And they proclaimed

  And <span class="v">Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so

    Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another.</a>
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="22">10:22</A></B>
  And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for
    all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="23">10:23</A></B>
  And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal,
    and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here
    with you none of the servants of the LORD, but the worshippers of Baal only.

  <span class="v">And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed

    escape, he that letteth him go, his life shall be for the life of him.</span>    
  
  <tr><td><B><A name="25">10:25</A></B>
  And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt

    none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword;</span> and the
    guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of
    Baal.

  And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned

  And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the house of Baal,

God is greatly pleased with all of Jehu's
