<p>(22:13) The members of "the great and abominable church" (the whore of all the earth) will kill each other and 
get drunk on their own blood.

<p><i>"The blood of that great and abominable church, which is the whore of all the earth, shall turn upon their own heads; 
for they shall war among themselves, and the sword of their own hands shall fall upon their own heads, 
and <b>they shall be drunken with their own blood</b>."</i>

<p>(22:14) All those that fight again Zion (Mormonism), like "that great whore, that great and abominable church" 
will be destroyed.

<p><i>"All that fight against Zion shall be destroyed, and that great whore, who hath perverted the right ways of the Lord, 
yea, that great and abominable church, shall tumble to the dust and great shall be the fall of it."</i>

        wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall  burn them up. -- <a href="../../mal/4.html#1">Mal.4:1</a>
        
        <p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (22:15) How could Nephi, supposedly writing this around 590 BCE, quote words from the book of 
        Malachi, which  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malachi">was not yet written</a>?

<p>(22:19) They who fight again Zion (Mormonism) will be cut off.

<p>(22:20) You must do whatever the prophet (Jesus or Joseph Smith?) says. Those who don't will be cut off.

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif" > (22:20)  A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all

Notice that this verse (which was supposed to have been written around 600 BCE) quotes Peter's paraphrase of

<tr><td><b><a name="12">22:12</b></a>   Wherefore, he will bring them again out of captivity, and they shall be gathered together to the 
lands of their inheritance; and they shall be brought out of obscurity and out of darkness; and they shall know that the 
Lord is their Savior and their Redeemer, the Mighty One of Israel. 

<tr><td><b><a name="13">22:13</b></a>   <span class="v">And the blood of that great and abominable church, which is the whore of all the earth, shall turn 
upon their own heads; for they shall war among themselves, and the sword of their own hands shall fall upon their own 
heads, and they shall be drunken with their own blood.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="14">22:14</b></a>   And every nation which shall war against thee, O house of Israel, shall be turned 
one against another, and they shall fall into the pit which they digged to ensnare the people of the Lord. 
And <span class="i">all that fight against Zion shall be destroyed, and that great whore, who hath </span>
<span class="plag">perverted the right ways of the Lord,</span><span class="i"> yea, that great and abominable church, 
shall tumble to the dust and great shall be the fall of it.</span> 

<tr><td valign="top"><b><a name="15">22:15</b></a>   <span class="plag">For behold,</span><span class="a"> saith the prophet</span>, the time cometh 
speedily that Satan shall have no more power over 
the hearts of the children of men; for <span class="p">the day soon cometh</span> that <span class="plag">all the proud and 
they who do wickedly shall be as stubble; and the day cometh that they must be burned. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="16">22:16</b></a>   <span class="p">For the time soon cometh</span> <span class="v">that the fulness of the wrath of God shall 
be poured out upon all the children of men</span>; for he will not suffer that the wicked shall destroy the righteous. 

<tr><td><b><a name="17">22:17</b></a>   Wherefore, he will preserve the righteous by his power, even if it so be that 
<span class="v">the fulness of his wrath must come, and the righteous be preserved, even unto the destruction of 
their enemies by fire.</span>  Wherefore, the 
righteous need not fear; for thus saith the prophet, <span class="plag">they shall be saved, even if it so be as by fire.</span> 

<tr><td valign="top"><b><a name="18">22:18</b></a>   Behold, my brethren, I say unto you, that <span class="p">these things must shortly 
come; yea, even </span><span class="plag">blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke</span> must come; and it must needs be upon the face of this earth; and it 
cometh unto men according to the flesh if it so be that they will harden their hearts against the Holy One of Israel.

<tr><td><b><a name="19">22:19</b></a>   For behold, the righteous shall not perish; for the time surely must come that all 
<span class="i">they who fight against Zion shall be cut off.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="20">22:20</b></a>   And the Lord will surely prepare a way for his people, unto the fulfilling of the 
words of Moses, which he spake, saying: <span class="i">A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, like unto me; 
him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.</span>
  <span class="plag">And </span> <span class="a">it shall come to pass</span> 
<span class="i">that all those who will not hear that prophet shall be cut off from among the people.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="21">22:21</b></a>   And now I, Nephi, declare unto you, that this prophet of whom Moses spake was the Holy One of 
Israel; wherefore, he shall execute judgment in righteousness. 

<tr><td><b><a name="22">22:22</b></a>   And the righteous need not fear, for they are those who shall not be confounded.  But it is the 
kingdom of the devil, which shall be built up among the children of men, which kingdom is established among them which 
are in the flesh --  

<tr><td><b><a name="23">22:23</b></a>   <span class="p">For the time speedily shall come that all churches</span> which are built up to get gain, and all those 
who are built up to get power over the flesh, and those who are built up to become popular in the eyes of the world, 
and those who seek the lusts of the flesh and the things of the world, and to do all manner of iniquity; yea, in fine, 
all those <span class="i">who belong to the kingdom of the devil</span> are they who need fear, and tremble, and quake; they are those who must 
be brought low in the dust; they are those who <span class="i">must be consumed as stubble</span>; and this is according to the words of the 
prophet. 

<tr><td><b><a name="24">22:24</b></a>   <span class="p">And the time cometh speedily</span> that the righteous must be led up as calves of the stall, and the Holy 
One of Israel must reign in dominion, and might, and power, and great glory. 

<tr><td><b><a name="25">22:25</b></a>   And he gathereth his children from the four quarters of the earth; and he numbereth his sheep, and 
they know him; and <span class="plag">there shall be one fold and one shepherd</span>; and he shall feed his sheep, and in him they shall find 
pasture. 

<tr><td><b><a name="26">22:26</b></a>   And because of the righteousness of his people, Satan has no power; wherefore, he cannot be loosed 
for the space of many years; for he hath no power over the hearts of the people, for they dwell in righteousness, and the 
Holy One of Israel reigneth. 

<tr><td><b><a name="27">22:27</b></a>   And now behold, I, Nephi, say unto you that all these things must come according to the flesh. 

<tr><td><b><a name="28">22:28</b></a>   But, behold, <span class="plag">all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people</span> shall dwell safely in the Holy One of 
Israel if it so be that they will repent. 

<tr><td><b><a name="29">22:29</b></a>   And now I, Nephi, make an end; for I durst not speak further as yet concerning these things. 

<tr><td><b><a name="30">22:30</b></a>   Wherefore, my brethren, I would that ye should consider that <span class="c">the things which have been written 
upon the plates of brass are true</span>; and they testify that a man must be obedient to the commandments of God. 

<tr><td><b><a name="31">22:31</b></a>   Wherefore, ye need not suppose that I and my father are the only ones that have testified, and 
also taught them.  Wherefore, <span class="plag">if ye</span> shall be obedient to the commandments, and <span class="plag">endure to the 
end, ye shall be saved</span> at the last day.  
And thus it is.  Amen.
