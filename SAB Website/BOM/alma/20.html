"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",
"<span class='i'>Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever.</span>--<a href='3.html#14'>Alma 3:14</a>",
"<span class='i'>I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</span>--<a href='3.html#15'>Alma 3:15</a>",
"<span class='I'>If ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd ... the devil is your shepherd.</span>--<a href='5.html#39'>Alma 5:39</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",
"<span class='a'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges ... even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year....</span>--<a href='16.html#1'>Alma 16:1</a>",
"<span class='a'>Their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.</span>--<a href='16.html#11'>Alma 16:11</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",
"<span class='v'>He [Ammon] smote off their arms with his sword; for he did withstand their blows by smiting their arms with the edge of his sword.</span>--<a href='17.html#37'>Alma 17:37</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.   Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</span>--<a href='30.html#22'>Alma 30:22</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",
"<span class='i'>God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.</span>--<a href='30.html#47'>Alma 30:47</a>",
"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Amalekites were of a more wicked and murderous disposition than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='43.html#6'>Alma 43:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lord is with us; and ye behold that he has delivered you into our hands.</span>--<a href='44.html#3'>Alma 44:3</a>",
"<span class='i'>God ... has strengthened  our arms that we have gained power over you, by  our faith, by our religion, and by our rites of worship, and by  our church.</span>--<a href='44.html#5'>Alma 44:5</a>",
"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",
"<span class='i'>These dissenters ... became ... more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='47.html#36'>Alma 47:36</a>",
"<span class='a'>God would prosper them in the land, or in other words ... God ... would prosper them in the land.</span>--<a href='48.html#15'>Alma 48:15</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='50.html#22'>Alma 50:22</a>",
"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",
"<span class='i'>The remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty.</span>--<a href='51.html#20'>Alma 51:20</a>",
"<span class='g'>And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye.</span>--<a href='54.html#21'>Alma 54:21</a>",
"<span class='v'>We did slay upwards of two thousand of them after they had surrendered themselves prisoners of war.</span>--<a href='57.html#14'>Alma 57:14</a>",

<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>20:1</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when they had established a church in that land, that 
king Lamoni desired that Ammon should go with him to the land of Nephi, that he might show him unto his father. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a> (20:1, 3, 8, 11, 28)
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>20:2</b>   And the voice of the Lord came to Ammon saying: Thou shalt not go up to the land of Nephi, for behold, 
the king will seek thy life; but thou shalt go to the land of Middoni; for behold, thy brother Aaron, and also Muloki 
and Ammah are in prison. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>20:3</b>   <span class="a">Now it came to pass</span> that when Ammon had heard this, he said unto Lamoni: Behold, my brother and 
brethren are in prison at Middoni, and I go that I may deliver them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>20:4</b>   Now Lamoni said unto Ammon: I know, in the strength of the Lord thou canst do all things.  But behold, 
I will go with thee to the land of Middoni; for the king of the land of Middoni, whose name is Antiomno, is a friend 
unto me; therefore I go to the land of Middoni, that I may flatter the king of the land, and he will cast thy brethren 
out of prison.  Now Lamoni said unto him: Who told thee that thy brethren were in prison? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>20:5</b>   And Ammon said unto him: No one hath told me, save it be God; and he said unto me -- Go and deliver 
thy brethren, for they are in prison in the land of Middoni. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>20:6</b>   Now when Lamoni had heard this he caused that his servants should make ready 
<span class="sci">his horses and his chariots</span>. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/sci1.gif" width="32" height="32">
Lamoni had horses and chariots. But horses and wheeled transportation didn't exist in the Pre-Columbian 
New World.  
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>20:7</b>   And he said unto Ammon: Come, I will go with thee down to the land of Middoni, and there I will plead 
with the king that he will cast thy brethren out of prison. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>20:8</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that as Ammon and Lamoni were journeying thither, they met 
the father of Lamoni, who was king over all the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>20:9</b>   And behold, the father of Lamoni said unto him: Why did ye not come to the feast on that great day when 
I made a feast unto my sons, and unto my people? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>20:10</b>   And he also said: Whither art thou going with this Nephite, who is one of the children of a liar? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>20:11</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Lamoni rehearsed unto him whither he was going, for he 
feared to offend him. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>20:12</b>   And he also told him all the cause of his tarrying in his own kingdom, that he did not go unto his 
father to the feast which he had prepared. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>20:13</b>   And now when Lamoni had rehearsed unto him all these things, behold, to his astonishment, his father 
was angry with him, and said: Lamoni, thou art going to deliver these Nephites, who are sons of a liar.  Behold, he 
robbed our fathers; and now his children are also come amongst us that they may, by their cunning and their lyings, 
deceive us, that they again may rob us of our property. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>20:14</b>   Now the father of Lamoni commanded him that he should slay Ammon with the sword.  And he also commanded 
him that he should not go to the land of Middoni, but that he should return with him to the land of Ishmael. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>20:15</b>   But Lamoni said unto him: I will not slay Ammon, neither will I return to the land of Ishmael, but 
I go to the land of Middoni that I may release the brethren of Ammon, for I know that they are just men and holy 
prophets of the true God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>20:16</b>   Now when his father had heard these words, he was angry with him, and he drew 
<span class="sci">his sword</span> that he might smite him to the earth. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/sci1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1">Just another of the many swords that are mentioned in the Book of Mormon at a time and place where 
swords did not exist.</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>20:17</b>   But Ammon stood forth and said unto him: Behold, thou shalt not slay thy son; nevertheless, it were 
better that he should fall than thee, for behold, he has repented of his sins; but if thou shouldst fall at this 
time, in thine anger, thy soul could not be saved. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>20:18</b>   And again, it is expedient that thou shouldst forbear; for if thou shouldst slay thy son, he being an 
innocent man, his blood would cry from the ground to the Lord his God, for vengeance to come upon thee; and perhaps thou 
wouldst lose thy soul. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>20:19</b>   Now when Ammon had said these words unto him, he answered him, saying: I know that if I should slay 
my son, that I should shed innocent blood; for it is thou that hast sought to destroy him. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>20:20</b>   And he stretched forth his hand to slay Ammon.  But Ammon withstood his blows, 
and also smote his arm that he could not use it. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>20:21</b>   Now when the king saw that Ammon could slay him, he began to plead with Ammon that he would spare his 
life. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>20:22</b>   But Ammon raised his sword, and said unto him: Behold, I will smite thee except thou wilt grant 
unto me that my brethren may be cast out of prison. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>20:23</b>   Now the king, fearing he should lose his life, said: If thou wilt spare me I will grant unto thee 
whatsoever thou wilt ask, even to half of the kingdom. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>20:24</b>   Now when Ammon saw that he had wrought upon the old king according to his desire, he said unto him: 
If thou wilt grant that my brethren may be cast out of prison, and also that Lamoni may retain his kingdom, and that 
ye be not displeased with him, but grant that he may do according to his own desires in whatsoever thing he thinketh, 
then will I spare thee; otherwise I will smite thee to the earth. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>20:25</b>   Now when Ammon had said these words, the king began to rejoice because of his life. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>20:26</b>   And when he saw that Ammon had no desire to destroy him, and when he also saw the great love he had 
for his son Lamoni, he was astonished <span class="a">exceedingly</span>, and said: Because this is all that thou hast 
desired, that I would release thy brethren, and suffer that my son Lamoni should retain his kingdom, behold, I will 
grant unto you that my son may retain his kingdom from this time and forever; and I will govern him no more --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32"><a href="exceed_list.html">Exceedingly</a> (20:26, 29) 
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>20:27</b>   And I will also grant unto thee that thy brethren may be cast out of prison, and thou and thy brethren 
may come unto me, in my kingdom; for I shall greatly desire to see thee.  For the king was greatly astonished at the 
words which he had spoken, and also at the words which had been spoken by his son Lamoni, therefore he was desirous to 
learn them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>20:28</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Ammon and Lamoni proceeded on their journey towards 
the land of Middoni.  And Lamoni found favor in the eyes of the king of the land; therefore the brethren of Ammon were 
brought forth out of prison. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>20:29</b>   And when Ammon did meet them he was <span class="a">exceedingly</span> sorrowful, for behold they were 
naked, and their skins were worn <span class="a">exceedingly</span> because of being bound with strong cords.  And they 
also had suffered hunger, thirst, and all kinds of afflictions; nevertheless they were patient in all their 
sufferings. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>20:30</b>   And, as it happened, it was their lot to have fallen into the hands of a more hardened and a more 
stiffnecked people; therefore they would not hearken unto their words, and they had cast them out, and had smitten 
them, and had driven them from house to house, and from place to place, even until they had arrived in the land of 
Middoni; and there they were taken and cast into prison, and bound with strong cords, and kept in prison for many days, 
and were delivered by Lamoni and Ammon. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
