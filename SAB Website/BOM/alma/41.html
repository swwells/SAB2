"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",
"<span class='i'>Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever.</span>--<a href='3.html#14'>Alma 3:14</a>",
"<span class='i'>I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</span>--<a href='3.html#15'>Alma 3:15</a>",
"<span class='I'>If ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd ... the devil is your shepherd.</span>--<a href='5.html#39'>Alma 5:39</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",
"<span class='a'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges ... even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year....</span>--<a href='16.html#1'>Alma 16:1</a>",
"<span class='a'>Their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.</span>--<a href='16.html#11'>Alma 16:11</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",
"<span class='v'>He [Ammon] smote off their arms with his sword; for he did withstand their blows by smiting their arms with the edge of his sword.</span>--<a href='17.html#37'>Alma 17:37</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.   Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</span>--<a href='30.html#22'>Alma 30:22</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",
"<span class='i'>God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.</span>--<a href='30.html#47'>Alma 30:47</a>",
"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Amalekites were of a more wicked and murderous disposition than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='43.html#6'>Alma 43:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lord is with us; and ye behold that he has delivered you into our hands.</span>--<a href='44.html#3'>Alma 44:3</a>",
"<span class='i'>God ... has strengthened  our arms that we have gained power over you, by  our faith, by our religion, and by our rites of worship, and by  our church.</span>--<a href='44.html#5'>Alma 44:5</a>",
"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",
"<span class='i'>These dissenters ... became ... more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='47.html#36'>Alma 47:36</a>",
"<span class='a'>God would prosper them in the land, or in other words ... God ... would prosper them in the land.</span>--<a href='48.html#15'>Alma 48:15</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='50.html#22'>Alma 50:22</a>",
"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",
"<span class='i'>The remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty.</span>--<a href='51.html#20'>Alma 51:20</a>",
"<span class='g'>And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye.</span>--<a href='54.html#21'>Alma 54:21</a>",
"<span class='v'>We did slay upwards of two thousand of them after they had surrendered themselves prisoners of war.</span>--<a href='57.html#14'>Alma 57:14</a>",

<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>41:1</b>   And now, my son, I have somewhat to say concerning the restoration of which has been spoken; for behold, 
some have wrested the scriptures, and have gone far astray because of this thing.  And I perceive that thy mind has been 
worried also concerning this thing.  But behold, I will explain it unto thee. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>41:2</b>   I say unto thee, my son, that the plan of restoration is requisite with the justice of God; for it 
is requisite that all things should be restored to their proper order.  Behold, it is requisite and just, according 
to the power and resurrection of Christ, that the soul of man should be restored to its body, and that every part 
of the body should be restored to itself. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>41:3</b>   And it is requisite with the justice of God that men should be judged according to their works; and 
if their works were good in this life, and the desires of their hearts were good, that they should also, at the last 
day, be restored unto that which is good. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>41:4</b>   And if their works are evil they shall be restored unto them for evil.  Therefore, all things shall 
be restored to their proper order, every thing to its natural frame -- <span class="plag">mortality raised to immortality, corruption 
to incorruption</span> -- raised to endless happiness to inherit the kingdom of God, or to endless misery to inherit the 
kingdom of the devil, the one on one hand, the other on the other --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/plag.gif" border="0" width="32" height="32">For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this 
mortal must put on  immortality. -- <a href="../../1cor/15.html#53">1 Corinthians 15:53</a></font>
 
<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>41:5</b>   The one raised to happiness according to his desires of happiness, or good according to his desires 
of good; and the other to evil according to his desires of evil; for as he has desired to do evil all the day long 
even so shall he have his reward of evil when the night cometh. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>41:6</b>   And so it is on the other hand.  If he hath repented of his sins, and desired righteousness until 
the end of his days, even so he shall be rewarded unto righteousness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>41:7</b>   These are they that are redeemed of the Lord; yea, these are they that are taken out, that are 
delivered from that endless night of darkness; and thus they stand or fall; for behold, they are their own 
judges, whether to do good or do evil. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>41:8</b>   Now, the decrees of God are unalterable; therefore, the way is prepared that whosoever will may 
walk therein and be saved. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>41:9</b>   And now behold, my son, do not risk one more offense against your God upon those points of doctrine, 
which ye have hitherto risked to commit sin. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>41:10</b>   Do not suppose, because it has been spoken concerning restoration, that ye shall be restored from 
sin to happiness.   Behold, I say unto you, wickedness never was happiness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>41:11</b>   And now, my son, all men that are in a state of nature, or I would say, in a 
carnal state, are <span class="plag">in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity</span>; they are 
<span class="plag">without God in the world</span>, and they have 
gone contrary to the nature of God; therefore, they are in a state contrary to the nature of happiness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/plag.gif" border="0" width="32" height="32">
Thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity. -- <a href="../../acts/8.html#23">Acts 8:23</a>

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif" border="0" width="32" height="32">
Without God in the world -- <a href="../../eph/2.html#12">Ephesians 2:12</a>
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>41:12</b>   And now behold, is the meaning of the word restoration to take a thing of a natural state and 
place it in an unnatural state, or to place it in a state opposite to its nature? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>41:13</b>   O, my son, this is not the case; but the meaning of the word restoration is to bring back 
again evil for evil, or carnal for carnal, or devilish for devilish -- good for that which is good; righteous 
for that which is righteous; just for that which is just; merciful for that which is merciful. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>41:14</b>   Therefore, my son, see that you are merciful unto your brethren; deal justly, judge righteously, 
and do good continually; and if ye do all these things then shall ye receive your reward; yea, ye shall have 
mercy restored unto you again; ye shall have justice restored unto you again; ye shall have a righteous judgment 
restored unto you again; and ye shall have good rewarded unto you again. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>41:15</b>   For that which ye do send out shall return unto you again, and be restored; therefore, the word 
restoration more fully condemneth the sinner, and justifieth him not at all. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
