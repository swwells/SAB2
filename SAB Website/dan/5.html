(5:1-2,11,18,22) <i>"Belshazzar the king "</i><br> Apparently, the author of Daniel knew
of only two Babylonian kings during the period of the exile: Nebuchadnezzar and
Belshazzar, who he wrongly thought was the son of Nebuchadnezzar. But
Nebuchadnezzar died in 562 BCE and was succeeded by his son, Awil-Marduk
(referred to in the bible as &quot;Evilmerodach&quot; [see <A
href="../2kg/25.html#27">2 Kg.25:27</A> and <A href="../jer/52.html#31">Jer.52:31</A>]).
In 560 BCE, Amel-Marduk was assassinated by his brother-in-law, Nergal-shar-usur.
The next and last king of Babylon was Nabonidus who reigned from 556 to 539,
when Babylon was conquered by Cyrus. It was Nabonidus, and not Belshazzar, who
was the last of the Babylonian kings. Belshazzar was the son and viceroy of Nabonidus. But he was not a king, and was not the son (or any other relation) of
Nebuchadnezzar.

<p>(5:1) <i>"Belshazzar the king"</i>

<p>(5:2) <i>"Belshazzar ... his father Nebuchadnezzar"</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<img src="../images/interp.gif" width="32" height="32"> (5:5-6) <i>The handwriting on the wall</i><br> 
Belshazzar was partying with his princes, wives, and concubines when a detached hand starts writing on the wall. When the king sees it 
"the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against the other."
    
<p>(5:5) <i>"In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote ... upon ... the wall ... and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote."</i>

<p>(5:6) <i>"Then the king's countenance was changed ... so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another."</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (5:8-28) Belshazzar asked his wise men to read and interpret the writing, but none of them could. So his wife tells him to 
ask Daniel to do it. And Daniel does, after insulting Belshazzar and his "father" Nebuchadnezzar. It's a message from God (he's the 
one who sent the hand down), saying that God hates Belshazzar and will soon take his kingdom away from him and give it to the Medes and Persians. 

<p>(5:8) <i>"All the king's wise men ... could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof."</i>

Darius I of Persia, who came to the throne in 521 BCE, 17 years after the fall of Babylon. The author of Daniel incorrectly makes him the successor of 
Belshazzar instead of Cyrus.
