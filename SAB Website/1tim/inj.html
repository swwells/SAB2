<p><li>"Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn
    not to blaspheme." Apparently (see <a href="../2tim/2.html#16">2 Tim 2:16-18</a> 
and <a href="../2tim/4.html#14">4:14-15</a>) their "blasphemy" was disagreeing with Paul. <a href="1.html#20">1:20</a>

<p><li>You should help a widow only if she: has no children or nephews; 
is desolate, trusts in God, and prays all the time; is not living in pleasure (a widow living in pleasure is the living dead); 
is over 60 years old; had only one husband; has raised children; has lodged strangers; has washed the saints' feet; has relieved 
the afflicted; and has diligently followed every good work. <a href="5.html#3">5:3-10</a>

<p><li>Never help a young widow (one under 60 years old). When they wax wanton against Christ, they'll get 
married, and be damned to hell for rejecting their faith. Besides, young widows are idle busybodies, wandering around from house to house saying 
things they shouldn't say. They should get married and have children (though 
they'll be damned to hell for it). Heck, some of them have already turned aside after Satan. <a href="5.html#11">5:11-15</a>

<p><li>Publicly humiliate those who sin by announcing their sins in front of God and everybody so 
"that others may also fear."  <a href="5.html#20">5:20</a>

<p><li> Slaves ("servants" in the KJV) should treat their masters "worthy of all honor, that the
    name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed." This is especially true when both slave and owner are Christians. Anyone that teaches otherwise 
    is a proud know-nothing. <a href="6.html#1">6:1-4</a>
