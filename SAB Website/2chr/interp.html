<p><li>Jehovah's Witnesses used to believe that God lives on the planet Alcyone in the Pleiades 
cluster. The only biblical justification for this was this verse and
<a href="../job/38.html#31">Job 38:31</a>. <a href="6.html#21">6:21</a>

<p><li>"If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and
    pray ... then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land."<br>
    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_zEq1L9FU">The Christian Right uses this verse</a> to argue for a Christian Nation. 
    But it can also be interpreted to mean that <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/unreasonablefaith/2012/03/christians-dont-vote-pray-instead/">Christians should pray, not vote.</a> 
 <a href="7.html#14">7:14</a>
 
 <p><li>"Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book
    of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies?" <a href="12.html#15">12:15</a>

<p><li><a href="../contra/polygamy.html">Is polygamy OK?</a> <a href="11.html#21">11:21</a>, <a href="13.html#21">13:21</a>,
 <a href="24.html#3">24:3</a>
 
 <p><li>When Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness, they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies."<br>
Is this where the Jehovah's Witnesses get The WatchTower? <a href="20.html#24">20:24</a>
