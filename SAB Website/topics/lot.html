<H3>Lot, the just and righteous</H3>
<ol>
<p>Lot was one of God's special heroes. Out of all of the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah, God saved only Lot and his 
family. This was because Lot was, according to the bible, a just and righteous man.

<blockquote><p>And delivered <i>just Lot</i>, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked: (For <i>that righteous man</i>
 dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed <i>his righteous soul</i> 
  from day to day with their unlawful deeds.) 
<a href="../2pet/2.html#7">2 Peter 2:7-8</a></blockquote>

<p>What did God like so much about Lot? Well, the bible doesn't say. About the only thing that we  
know about him is that he offered his two virgin daughters to a crowd of angel rapers, saying:
<blockquote><p>Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let 
  me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your 
  eyes. <a href="../gen/19.html#8">Gen.19:8</a><br>

<p>(Lot was lying about the "virgin" part, just to make his daughters look more attractive to the lecherous mob. According 
to (<a href="../gen/19.html#14">Gen.19:14</a>) both of his "virgin" daughters were married.)</blockquote>
<p>And that he later allowed himself to get drunk and impregnate them.
<blockquote><p>And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him....
    And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in
    unto us after the manner of all the earth: 
    Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may
    preserve seed of our father. 
    And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay
    with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. 
    And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay
    yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and 
  go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. And 
  they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and 
  lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. Thus 
  were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. <a href="../gen/19.html#30">Gen.19:30-36</a></blockquote>
<p>But that should be enough to show us what God considers &quot;just and righteous.&quot; 
</ol>
