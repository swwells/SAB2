   <IMG src="../images/fv.gif" > (16:1) After Samson finished <a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2009/11/gods-52nd-killing-samson-kills-1000.html">killing 1000 men with the jawbone of an ass</a>, 
   he had sex with a prostitute.
   
   <p>(16:1) <b><i>"Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her."</i></b>
       
<p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (16:3) At midnight, he left the prostitute and ripped out the doors and gate posts of the city and carried them to the top of a hill.

<p>(16:3) <i>"Samson ... took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them."</i>
     
<p><IMG src="../images/sex1.gif" >
   <IMG src="../images/fv.gif" > (16:4) Then Samson saw and fell in love with Delilah.
   
   <p>(16:4) <i>"Afterward ... he loved a woman ... whose name was Delilah."</i>
   
   <p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (16:6) Delilah was paid by the Philistines to find the magical source of Samson's strength and to figure out how he could be restrained. 
   So she asked Samson three times about it, while some Philistines hid in another room.
   
   <p>(16:6) <i>"Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound."</i>

 <p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (16:7-9) The first time he said that he'd become as week as any other man if he were tied up with bowstrings. So she did that and 
    then shouted, "Hey Samson, the Philistines are coming!" But he broke the bowstrings as though they were burnt strings.   
   
   <p>(16:7) <i>"Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man."</i>
   
   <p>(16:8) <i>"The Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them."</i>
   
   <p>(16:9) <i>"And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire."</i>
   
   <p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (16:10-12) She asked again and he told her to use ropes. So she tied him with ropes 
   and then shouted, "Hey Samson, the Philistines are coming!" But he broke the ropes like they were threads.
   
   <p>(16:10) <i>"Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound."</i>
   
   <p>(16:11) <i>"And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man."</i>

   <p>(16:12) <i>"Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson ... And he brake them from off his arms like a thread."</i>
  
   <p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (16:13-14) She asked him a third time, and he told her to weave his seven braids into a cloth and fasten the whole mess to the wall. 
    So she did that and then shouted, "Hey Samson (you dumb shit), the Philistines are coming!" But he broke out of that one, too.
    
    <p>(16:13) <i>"Delilah said unto Samson ... tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web."</i>
    
    <p>(16:14) <i>"And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he ... went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web."</i>

    <p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (16:16-17) But Delilah didn't give up. She kept pestering him until finally Samson told her the true source of his strength. 
    It was his hair. If his hair was shaved off, he'd become as weak as any other man.
    
    <p>(16:16-17) <i>"When she pressed him daily ... he told her ... There hath not come a razor upon mine head ... if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me,
     and I shall become weak, and be like any other man."</i>
     
     <p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (16:19-20) <br>So when Samson fell asleep on her lap, she cut his hair. 
     
    <p>(16:19) <i>"She made him sleep upon her knees ... to shave off the seven locks of his head ... and his strength went from him."</i>
    
    <p>(16:20) <i>"And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him."</i>
 
<p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (16:21) Then the Philistines captured Samson, gouged out his eyes, 
    and put him in prison. 
    
    <p>(16:21) <i>"The Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house."</i>

     Later, at one of their big parties, the Philistines brought Samson out to entertain them. Then Samson, with God's help, killed himself
and 3000 Philistine men and women by causing a roof to collapse. This was the first suicide terrorist attack. God approved of of it and gave Samson the strength to do it. And although 
the Bible doesn't say so, there are unconfirmed reports that Samson shouted "God is great (Allahu Akbar)" as the walss came tumbling down.<br>

  Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a

  And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call
