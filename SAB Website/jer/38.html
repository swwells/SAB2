  Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and
    Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words
    that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying,<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="2">38:2</A></B>
  Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this city shall die by the

    Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  <tr><td><B><A name="4">38:4</A></B>
  Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let this man be
    put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain
    in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto
    them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="5">38:5</A></B>
  Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the king is
    not he that can do any thing against you.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="6">38:6</A></B>
  Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son
    of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down
    Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so
    Jeremiah sunk in the mire.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="7">38:7</A></B>
  Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the
    king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then
    sitting in the gate of Benjamin;<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="8">38:8</A></B>
  Ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house, and spake to the king

  My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to
    Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like

    the city.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, <span class="a">Take from hence

It took thirty men to lift Jeremiah out of the dungeon. (He was a very

  So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king

    let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="12">38:12</A></B>
  And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these old cast

    did so.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="13">38:13</A></B>
  So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon:

  <tr><td><B><A name="14">38:14</A></B>
  Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into
    the third entry that is in the house of the LORD: and the king said unto
    Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="15">38:15</A></B>
  Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not

    unto me?<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="16">38:16</A></B>
  So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As the LORD
    liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I
    give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="17">38:17</A></B>
  Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts,
    the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of
    Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be
    burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house:<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="18">38:18</A></B>
  But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall
    this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it
    with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="19">38:19</A></B>
  And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are
    fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock
    me.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="20">38:20</A></B>
  But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the
    voice of the LORD, which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well unto thee,
    and thy soul shall live.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="21">38:21</A></B>
  But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD hath shewed
    me:<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="22">38:22</A></B>
  And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah's house
    shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those women
    shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against thee:
    thy feet are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="23">38:23</A></B>
  So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans:
    and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand
    of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with
    fire.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="24">38:24</A></B>
  Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou
    shalt not die.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="25">38:25</A></B>
  But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto
    thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the
    king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the
    king said unto thee:<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="26">38:26</A></B>
  Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the

    there.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="27">38:27</A></B>
  Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them
    according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off
    speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="28">38:28</A></B>
  So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem
