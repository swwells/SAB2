<p><li>God appoints Judah to succeed Joshua. The Lord delivers his foes into his hands and another 10,000 are slain.
In the process, they capture Adonibezek and "cut off his thumbs and great toes." Nice guys.  <a href="1.html#2">
1:2-6</a>

<p><li>Ehud delivers a "message from God" to the king of Moab. God's message consists of a knife thrust so deeply
into the king's belly that it could not be extracted, "and the dirt came out." Just another lovely Bible story.
 <a href="3.html#15">3:15-22</a>
 
<p><li>Shamgar kills 600 Philistines with an ox goad. Praise God.  <a href="3.html#31">3:31</a>

<p><li>Jael (our heroine) offers food and shelter to a traveler (Sisera, Jabin's captain), saying "turn in my Lord ...
fear not." Then after giving him a glass of milk and tucking him in, she drives a tent stake through his head. "So God
subdued on that day Jabin."  <a href="4.html#17">4:17-23</a>

<p><li>When Gideon and his water-lapping companions blow their trumpets, God forces all the enemy soldiers to kill
each other, killing 120,000.  <a href="7.html#22">7:22</a>, <a href="8.html#10">8:10</a>

<p><li>Two princes are killed and their heads are brought to Gideon.  <a href="7.html#25">7:25</a>

<p><li>For refusing to feed him and his army, Gideon tears the flesh off the elders of Succoth and kills the men of the
city.  <a href="8.html#7">8:7</a>, <a href="8.html#26">16</a>

<p><li>Gideon orders his son to kill two kings, but he refuses. So Gideon has to do it himself since his son isn't "man"
enough to do it.  <a href="8.html#20">8:20</a>

<p><li>Abimelech kills 69 brothers "upon one stone." (He was trying to get in the Guinness Book of World Records.) 
 <a href="9.html#5">9:5</a>
 
<p><li>God sends evil spirits that cause humans to deal treacherously with each other.  
<a href="9.html#23">9:23-24</a>

<p><li>When "the spirit of the Lord" comes upon Jephthah, he makes a deal with God: If God will help him kill the
Ammonites, then he (Jephthah) will offer to God as a burnt offering whatever comes out of his house to greet him.
God keeps his end of the deal by providing Jephthah with "a very great slaughter." But when Jephthah returns, his
nameless daughter comes out to greet him (who'd he expect, his wife?). Well, a deal's a deal, so he delivers her to
God as a burnt offering -- after letting her spend a couple of months going up and down on the mountains bewailing
her virginity.  <a href="11.html#29">11:29-39</a>

<p><li>Samson rips up a young lion when "the spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him." <a href="14.html#5">14:5-8</a>

<p><li>"And the spirit of the Lord came upon him [Samson], and he ... slew thirty men." (Samson might have been a
decent person if he could have kept the spirit of the Lord off him.)  <a href="14.html#19">14:19</a>

<p><li>Samson catches 300 foxes, ties their tails together, and sets them on fire; the Philistines 
burn Samson's ex-wife and father-in-law; and Samson smites them "hip and thigh with a great 
slaughter." <a href="15.html#4">15:4-8</a>

<p><li>"The spirit of the Lord came mightily upon" Samson and "he found a new jawbone of an ass ... and took it,
and slew 1000 men therewith."  <a href="15.html#14">15:14-15</a>

<p><li>Samson, with God's help, kills himself and 3000 Philistine men and women by causing a roof to collapse, 
setting an example for Bible-based terrorism. <a href="16.html#27">16:27-30</a>

<p><li>After taking in a traveling Levite, the host offers his virgin daughter and his guest's concubine to a mob of
perverts (who want to have sex with his guest). The mob refuses the daughter, but accepts the concubine and they
"abuse her all night." The next morning she crawls back to the doorstep and dies. The Levite puts her dead body on an
ass and takes her home. Then he chops her body up into twelve pieces and sends them to each of the twelve tribes of
Israel  <a href="19.html#22">19:22-30</a>
 
 <p><li> The Israelites finish their massacre of the Benjamites by killing all the men, animals, and 
     everything they could find in every Benjamite city. Then they burned the cities to the ground. 
     (In this way God helped the Israelites make everything better after the rape and dismemberment of 
     the concubine.) <a href="20.html#48">20:48</a>
     
<p><li>To find wives for the Benjamites (they were unwilling to use their own daughters), the other tribes attacked
and killed all occupants of a city except for the young virgins. These virgins were then given to the Benjamites for
wives.  <a href="21.html#7">21:7-23</a>
