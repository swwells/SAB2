<img src="../images/cr1.gif" > (26:7-8) God tells the Israelites to "chase" their enemies and make them "fall before you by the
sword." He figures five of the Israelites will be able to "chase" a hundred of their enemies, and a
hundred will be able to "put ten thousand to flight." 

<p>(26:7) <i>"Ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword."</i>

<p>(26:8) <i>"Five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword."</i>

<img src="../images/abs1.gif" >  (26:14-41) <br>God describes torments that he has planned for those who displease him. The usual stuff: plagues, burning fevers that will consume 
the eyes, etc., but he reserves the worst for the little children. He says "ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it,"  
"I will send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children," and "ye shall eat the flesh of your sons and daughters."

<p>Here are the gory details: 

<p>(26:14) <i>"But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these  commandments,"</i>
    
<p>(26:15) <i>"And if ye shall despise my statutes ... so that ye will not do all my commandments,"</i><br>
    
    If you don't follow all of the laws in the Old Testament, God will shower you with all of the curses in the next 25 verses. (See 
    <a href="../dt/28.html#15">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a> for an even longer and nastier list.) 
 
<p> (26:16) <I>"<b>I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning
