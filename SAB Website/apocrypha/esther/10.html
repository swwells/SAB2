<td bgcolor="eeeeee" rowspan="14">

<font size="-1">
The Hebrew text of the Book of Esther ends with verse 10:3. When Jerome created the Vulgate Bible, he added the Greek additions from 
the Septuagint at the end of the Hebrew text, rather than place them in their proper context. In the notes, I will mention where the additions 
originally were in the Greek text.

<p><b>Addition F: 104 - 11:1</b><br>
This passage interprets the dream of Mordecai in 11:2 - 12.6, which formed the beginning of the Greek version of Esther.

<p><img src="../../images/cr1.gif">
<img src="../../images/inj1.gif"> (10:4) <b><i>"God hath done these things."</i></b><br>
The apocrypha to the rescue! The original (Hebrew) book of Esther was completely godless, so the genocides arranged by Esther and Mordecai (Mardochai in the Douay-Rheims) 
could not be attributed to God. But the first line of the apocryphal text takes care of that: "God hath done all these things." (Who else would be so damned nasty?)

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (10:6-10) Modecai's dream (See <a href="11.html#2">11:2 - 12:6</a>.)

<p>(10:6) <i>"The little fountain which grew into a river ... is Esther."</i>

<p>(10:7) <i>"The two dragons are I and Aman."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/int.gif"> (10:10) <i>"The Lord ... commanded that there should be two lots, one of the people of God, and the other of all the nations"</i><br>
God likes Jews more than everyone else.

<p><img src="../../images/int.gif">
<img src="../../images/cr1.gif">
<img src="../../images/inj1.gif"> (10:12) <i>"The Lord remembered his people."</i> <br>(By having them murder thousands of people.)

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (10:13) <i>"These days shall be observed in the month of Adar on the fourteenth, and fifteenth 
day of the same month. with all diligence, and joy of the people gathered into one assembly, throughout all the generations hereafter 
of the people of Israel."</i> (How many times does God have to tell us this?)

<tr><td><B><A name="2">10:2</A></B> And his strength and his empire, and the dignity and greatness wherewith he exalted Mardochai, 
are written in the books of the Medes, and of the Persians:

and acceptable to the people of his brethren, seeking the good of his people, and speaking those things which were for the welfare of his seed. 

<tr><td><B><A name="4">10:4</a></b> Then Mardochai said: <span class="v">God hath done these things.</span> 

<tr><td><B><A name="5">10:5</a></b> I remember a dream that I saw, which signified these same things: and nothing thereof hath failed.

 and abounded into many waters, <span class="a">is Esther</span>, whom the king married, and made queen.

	<span class="int">the Lord </span>saved his people: and he delivered us from all evils, 
and hath wrought great signs and wonders among the nations:
