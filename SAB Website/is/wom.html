<p><li>"How is the faithful city become an harlot." <a href="1.html#21">1:21</a>

<p><li>Isaiah shows his contempt for women by saying that things have gotten so bad for his people that "women rule over them." 
<a href="3.html#12">3:12</a>

<p><li>God will "smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion" and "will discover their secret parts" since he 
doesn't like the way they dress and walk.  <a href="3.html#16">3:16-17</a>

<p><li>After God takes away the women's jewelry and perfume, "discovers their secret parts," 
and makes them all bald and stinking, he'll kill their husbands.
Women will then become so desperate that "seven women will take hold of one man, saying ... let us be called by thy name, to
take away our reproach."  <a href="4.html#1">4:1</a>

<p><li>After God "washed away the filth" from the women and killed the men, he set up 
"a cloud and smoke by day" and a "flaming fire by night." <a href="4.html#4">4:4-5</a>

<p><li>Egypt will become weakened and frightened "like unto women" when God shakes his hand over it.
  <a href="19.html#16">19:16</a>

<p><li>Talking about graven images Isaiah says, "thou shalt cast them away as a menstrous cloth."  <a href="30.html#22">30:22</a>

<p><li>"Tremble, ye women that are at ease .. strip you, and make you bare ... They shall lament for the teats." 
<a href="32.html#12">32:11-12</a>

<p><li>Ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the whore."<br>
