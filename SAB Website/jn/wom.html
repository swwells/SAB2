<p><li>"Woman, what have I to do with thee?" <br>
And his most blessed mother said unto him, "I'm your fucking 
mother, you jerk." (Or words to that effect.) <a href="2.html#4">2:4</a>

<p><li>Jesus magically perceived that a Samaritan woman had been married and divorced five times previously. 
(He could spot a divorced woman a mile away.) Since women weren't allowed to get a divorce, it was always the woman's fault 
and divorced women were considered outcasts. This was a great opportunity for Jesus to explain why the Mosaic marriage laws
 were unjust and correct them -- if he thought they were wrong, that is, which apparently he didn't. <a href="4.html#7">4:7-18</a>

<p><li>Jesus tells Mary Magdalene not to touch him because he hasn't yet ascended -- as if the touch of a woman
would defile him and somehow prevent him from ascending into heaven. <a href="20.html#17">20:17</a>
