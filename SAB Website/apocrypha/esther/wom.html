<p><li>King Assuerus throws a seven-day party and encourages his
guests to drink to excess. Then, on the seventh day when they are all drunk, he orders Queen Vashti
to show her stuff before him and his guests. <a href="1.html#5">1:5-11</a>

<p><li>Vashti refuses to entertain the king's drunken guests by dancing before them. For this she is no longer to be queen, 
to be replaced by someone better (prettier?). <a href="1.html#12">1:12-19</a>

<p><li> Because of Vashti's disobedience, the king decrees that " all wives ... give honour to their husbands" 
and "the husbands should be rulers and masters in their houses." <a href="1.html#20">1:20-22</a>

<p><li> All the "beautiful maidens and virgins" throughout the kingdom are brought before the king, and the one that "pleaseth" the king the most will replace Vashti. <a href="2.html#2">2:2-4</a>

<p><li> When it was Esther turn to "go in unto the king," she pleases the king the most. Having won the sex contest, she is made queen in Vashti's place. <a href="2.html#8">2:8-17</a>

<p><li>"I ... detest it as a menstruous rag." <a href="14.html#16">14:16</a>
