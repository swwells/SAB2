<p><li>When two men strive together on with another, and the wife of the one ... putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets: Then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall not pity her</i>.--<a href='../dt/25.html#1' >25:11-12</a>
<p><li>The LORD shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he have  consumed thee from off the land.--<a href='../dt/28.html#21' >28:21</a>
<p><li>The LORD shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a fever, and  with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, and  with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue thee until thou perish.--<a href='../dt/28.html#22' >28:22</a>
<p><li>Thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air, and unto  the beasts of the earth, and no man shall fray them away.--<a href='../dt/28.html#26' >28:26</a>
<p><li>The LORD will smite thee with the botch of Egypt, and with the  emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou canst not be  healed.--<a href='../dt/28.html#27' >28:27</a>
<p><li>The LORD shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and  astonishment of heart.--<a href='../dt/28.html#28' >28:28</a>
<p><li>Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people, and  thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day long.--<a href='../dt/28.html#32' >28:32</a>
<p><li>The LORD shall smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore  botch that cannot be healed, from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy  head.--<a href='../dt/28.html#35' >28:35</a>
<p><li>And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy  sons and of thy daughters.--<a href='../dt/28.html#53' >28:53</a>
<p><li>So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children  whom he shall eat.--<a href='../dt/28.html#55' >28:55</a>
<p><li>The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure  to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her  son, and toward her daughter, and toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and  toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them.--<a href='../dt/28.html#56' >28:56-57</a>
<p><li>I will heap mischiefs upon them. I will spend mine arrows upon them.--<a href='../dt/32.html#23' >32:23</a>
<p><li>They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and  with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with  the poison of serpents of the dust.--<a href='../dt/32.html#24' >32:24</a>
<p><li>The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young  man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs.--<a href='../dt/32.html#25' >32:25</a>
<p><li>If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment;  I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me. I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour  flesh</i>.--<a href='../dt/32.html#41' >32:41-42</a>

<h4>Joshua</h4>
<p><li>And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and  woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.--<a href='../jos/6.html#21' > 6:21</a>
<p><li>He that is taken with the accursed thing</i> shall  be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath.--<a href='../jos/7.html#15' > 7:15</a>
