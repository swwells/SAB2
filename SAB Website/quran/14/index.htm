And (have ye not) dwelt in the dwellings of those who wronged themselves  (of old) and (hath it not) become plain to you how We dealt with them and made  examples for you ? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td><b>14:<a NAME="46">46</b></a>
Verily they have plotted their plot, and their plot is with Allah, though their  plot were one whereby the mountains should be moved. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b>14:<a NAME="47">47</b></a>
So think not that Allah will fail to keep His promise to His messengers. Lo!  Allah is Mighty, Able to Requite (the wrong). <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

On the day when the earth will be changed to other than the earth, and the  heavens (also will be changed) and they will come forth unto Allah, the One, the  Almighty, <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

That Allah may repay each soul what it hath earned. Lo! Allah is swift at  reckoning.

This is a clear message for mankind in order that they may be warned  thereby, and that they may know that He is only 
One God, and that men of  understanding may take heed.
