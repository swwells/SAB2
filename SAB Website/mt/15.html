  <img src="../images/cr1.gif"> (15:1-7) Jesus is criticized by the Pharisees for not
washing his hands before eating. He defends himself by attacking them for not
killing disobedient children according to the commandment: "He that curseth
father or mother, let him die the death." (See <A href="../ex/21.html#15">Ex.21:15</A>,
<A href="../lev/20.html#9">Lev.20:9</A>, <A href="../dt/21.html#18">Dt.21:18-21</A>) 
 <p>So, does Jesus think that children who curse their parents should be killed? It sure sounds like it. But maybe 
he was just making excuses for not washing his hands before eating. (My kids used to do that when it was time to eat.)<br>

    Jesus visits Tyre which according to Ezekiel (<A href="../ezek/26.html#14">26:14</a>, <A href="../ezek/26.html#21">:21</A>;

<img src="../images/contra1.gif"> (15:22-26) Jesus refuses to heal the 
Canaanite woman's possessed daughter, saying "it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to the dogs."<br>
<A href="../contra/samaritans.html">Should the gospel be preached to everyone?</a>

<p>(15:22) <i>"A woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, 
thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil."</i>

<p>(15:23) <i>"But he answered her not a word."</i>

<p>(15:24) <i>"I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel."</i>

<p>(15:25) <i>"Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me."</i>

<p>(15:26) <i>"But he answered and said, <b>It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.</b>"</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif">(15:27-28) After the Canaanite woman grovels a bit more at Jesus' feet and admits to being "a dog," Jesus 
cast out her daughter's devil.

<p>(15:27) <i>"And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table."</i>

<p>(15:28) <i>"Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. 
And her daughter was made whole from that very hour."</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (15:29-30) Jesus went up on a mountain and healed "a great multitude" of lame, blind, dumb, and maimed people.

<p>(15:29) <i>"Jesus ... went up into a mountain, and sat down there."</i>

<p>(15:30) <i>"And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, 
and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:"</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif" > (15:31-38) A "great multitude" had been following Jesus for three days, and were getting 
hungry. So Jesus told his disciples to feed them. His disciples wondered where they would get the food. But they should have known by now, 
since Jesus just did the same trick in <A href="14.html#14">14:14-21</A>. These stories are probably
the result of two oral versions of the same fictitious story.

<p>(15:32) <i>"Jesus ... said, I have compassion on the multitude, 
because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat."</i>

<p>(15:33) <i>"His disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?"</i>

<p>(15:34) <i>"Jesus saith ... How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes."</i>

<p>(15:36) <i>"He took the seven loaves and the fishes ... and gave to his disciples,

  Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth

  But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart;
    and they defile the man.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="19">15:19</A></B>
  For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,
    fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:

  These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands

  <span class="i">Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.</span>
