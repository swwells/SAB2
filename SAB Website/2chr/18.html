(18:5-34) <i>The trouble with prophets</i><br>
    The kings of Israel and Judah meet to decide whether they should attack Ramothgilead. They ask 400 prophets and they all say that 
    the kings should attack because "God will deliver it into the king's hand." But then they ask Micaiah, who says the same thing, but 
    apparently was being sarcastic. Then Micaiah tells everyone about a vision he had of God where God is looking for some prophets to 
    lie for him. Someone volunteered to lie for God and God said, "Good, lie for me." So the kings went to war and the king of Israel (Ahab) 
    was killed. (Which was God's plan all along. God was punishing Ahab for not killing a captured king. See <a href="../1kg/20.html#42">1 Kings 20:42</a>)
