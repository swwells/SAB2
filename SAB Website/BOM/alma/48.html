"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",
"<span class='i'>Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever.</span>--<a href='3.html#14'>Alma 3:14</a>",
"<span class='i'>I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</span>--<a href='3.html#15'>Alma 3:15</a>",
"<span class='I'>If ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd ... the devil is your shepherd.</span>--<a href='5.html#39'>Alma 5:39</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",
"<span class='a'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges ... even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year....</span>--<a href='16.html#1'>Alma 16:1</a>",
"<span class='a'>Their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.</span>--<a href='16.html#11'>Alma 16:11</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",
"<span class='v'>He [Ammon] smote off their arms with his sword; for he did withstand their blows by smiting their arms with the edge of his sword.</span>--<a href='17.html#37'>Alma 17:37</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.   Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</span>--<a href='30.html#22'>Alma 30:22</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",
"<span class='i'>God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.</span>--<a href='30.html#47'>Alma 30:47</a>",
"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Amalekites were of a more wicked and murderous disposition than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='43.html#6'>Alma 43:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lord is with us; and ye behold that he has delivered you into our hands.</span>--<a href='44.html#3'>Alma 44:3</a>",
"<span class='i'>God ... has strengthened  our arms that we have gained power over you, by  our faith, by our religion, and by our rites of worship, and by  our church.</span>--<a href='44.html#5'>Alma 44:5</a>",
"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",
"<span class='i'>These dissenters ... became ... more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='47.html#36'>Alma 47:36</a>",
"<span class='a'>God would prosper them in the land, or in other words ... God ... would prosper them in the land.</span>--<a href='48.html#15'>Alma 48:15</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='50.html#22'>Alma 50:22</a>",
"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",
"<span class='i'>The remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty.</span>--<a href='51.html#20'>Alma 51:20</a>",
"<span class='g'>And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye.</span>--<a href='54.html#21'>Alma 54:21</a>",
"<span class='v'>We did slay upwards of two thousand of them after they had surrendered themselves prisoners of war.</span>--<a href='57.html#14'>Alma 57:14</a>",

<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>48:1</b>   <span class="a">And now it came to pass</span> that, as soon as Amalickiah had obtained the 
kingdom he began to inspire the hearts of the Lamanites against the people of Nephi; yea, he did appoint men to speak 
unto the Lamanites from their towers, against the Nephites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1"><a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a>
(48:1, 6, 7)
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>48:2</b>   And thus he did inspire their hearts against the Nephites, insomuch that in the latter end of the 
nineteenth year of the reign of the judges, he having accomplished his designs thus far, yea, having been made king 
over the Lamanites, he sought also to reign over all the land, yea, and all the people who were in the land, the 
Nephites as well as the Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>48:3</b>   Therefore he had accomplished his design, for he had hardened the hearts of the Lamanites and 
blinded their minds, and stirred them up to anger, insomuch that he had gathered together a numerous host to go 
to battle against the Nephites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>48:4</b>   For he was determined, because of the greatness of the number of his people, to overpower 
the Nephites and to bring them into bondage. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>48:5</b>   And thus he did appoint chief captains of the Zoramites, they being the most acquainted with 
the strength of the Nephites, and their places of resort, and the weakest parts of their cities; therefore he 
appointed them to be chief captains over his armies. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>48:6</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they took their camp, and moved forth toward the 
land of Zarahemla in the wilderness. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>48:7</b>   <span class="a">Now it came to pass</span> that while Amalickiah had thus been obtaining power by fraud and deceit, 
Moroni, on the other hand, had been preparing the minds of the people to be faithful unto the Lord their God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>48:8</b>   Yea, he had been strengthening the armies of the Nephites, and erecting small forts, or places of 
resort; throwing up banks of earth round about to enclose his armies, and also building walls of stone to encircle 
them about, round about their cities and the borders of their lands; yea, all round about the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>48:8</b>   And in their weakest fortifications he did place the greater number of men; and thus he did 
fortify and strengthen the land which was possessed by the Nephites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>48:10</b>   And thus he was preparing to support their liberty, their lands, their wives, and 
their children, and their peace, and that they might live unto the Lord their God, and that they might maintain 
that which was called by their enemies the cause of <span class="a">Christians</span>. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32"><br>
<font size="-1">The Nephites were called "Christians" 70 years before Jesus was born. 
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>48:11</b>   And Moroni was a strong and a mighty man; he was a man of a perfect understanding; 
yea, a man that did not delight in bloodshed; a man whose soul did joy in the liberty and the freedom of his 
country, and his brethren from bondage and slavery; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>48:12</b>   Yea, a man whose heart did swell with thanksgiving to his God, for the many privileges and 
blessings which he bestowed upon his people; a man who did labor <span class="a">exceedingly</span> for the 
welfare and safety of his people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1"><a href="exceed_list.html">Exceedingly</a> 
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>48:13</b>   Yea, and he was a man who was firm in the faith of Christ, and he had sworn with an oath to 
defend his people, his rights, and his country, and his religion, even to the loss of his blood. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>48:14</b>   Now the Nephites were taught to defend themselves against their enemies, even to the shedding of 
blood if it were necessary; yea, and they were also taught never to give an offense, yea, and never to raise the 
sword except it were against an enemy, except it were to preserve their lives. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>48:15</b>   And this was their faith, that by so doing <span class="a">God would prosper 
them in the land, or in other words</span>, 
if they were faithful in keeping the commandments of <span class="a">God</span> that he <span class="a">would prosper 
them in the land</span>; yea, warn them 
to flee, or to prepare for war, according to their danger; <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32"><br>
<font size="-1">"God would prosper them in the land, or in other words, ... God ... would prosper them in the land." 
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>48:16</b>   And also, that God would make it known unto them whither they should go to defend themselves 
against their enemies, and by so doing, the Lord would deliver them; and this was the faith of Moroni, and his 
heart did glory in it; not in the shedding of blood but in doing good, in preserving his people, yea, in keeping 
the commandments of God, yea, and resisting iniquity. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>48:17</b>   Yea, verily, verily I say unto you, if all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like 
unto Moroni, behold, the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever; yea, the devil would never have 
power over the hearts of the children of men. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>48:18</b>   Behold, he was a man like unto Ammon, the son of Mosiah, yea, and even the other sons of 
Mosiah, yea, and also Alma and his sons, for they were all men of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>48:19</b>   Now behold, Helaman and his brethren were no less serviceable unto the people than was Moroni; 
for they did preach the word of God, and they did baptize unto repentance all men whosoever would hearken unto 
their words. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>48:20</b>   And thus they went forth, and the people did humble themselves because of their words, insomuch 
that they were highly favored of the Lord, and thus they were free from wars and contentions among themselves, 
yea, even for the space of four years. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>48:21</b>   But, as I have said, in the latter end of the nineteenth year, yea, notwithstanding their 
peace amongst themselves, they were compelled reluctantly to contend with their brethren, the Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>48:22</b>   Yea, and in fine, their wars never did cease for the space of many years with the Lamanites, 
notwithstanding their much reluctance. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>48:23</b>   Now, they were sorry to take up arms against the Lamanites, because they did not delight 
in the shedding of blood; yea, and this was not all -- they were sorry to be the means of sending so many 
of their brethren out of this world into an eternal world, unprepared to meet their God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>48:24</b>   Nevertheless, they could not suffer to lay down their lives, that their wives and their 
children should be massacred by the barbarous cruelty of those who were once their brethren, yea, and had 
dissented from their church, and had left them and had gone to destroy them by joining the Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>48:25</b>   Yea, they could not bear that their brethren should rejoice over the blood of the Nephites, 
so long as there were any who should keep the commandments of God, for the promise of the Lord was, if they 
should keep his commandments they should prosper in the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
