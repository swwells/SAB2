make them known unto me, as I sat pondering in mine heart <span class="a">I was caught away in the Spirit

had before seen</span>, and upon which I never had before set my foot. <td bgcolor="eeeeee" rowspan="30">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (11:1-6) A spirit takes Nephi up to the top of an exceedingly high mountain and shows him all the shit his dad saw: Jesus, Mary, John the 
Baptist, the twelve apostles, Lehi's magic tree and iron rod, the large and spacious building, angels, devils, the condescension of God, 
and the wisdom of the world.

<p>(11:1) The first thing that comes to pass is that Nephi ponders his dad's 
imaginary tree, gets caught up in the spirit of the Lord, and is transported to an exceedingly high mountain.

<p><i>"For it came to pass after I had desired to know the things that my father had seen ... I was caught away in the Spirit of the Lord, 
yea, into an exceedingly high mountain, which I never had before seen."</i>

<p>(11:2) And then he has a conversation with his new-found spirit friend. 
The spirit asked him what he wanted.

<p><i>"And the Spirit said unto me: Behold, what desirest thou?"</i>

<p>(11:3) Nephi said he'd like to see some of the shit his dad saw.

<p><i>"And I said: I desire to behold the things which my father saw"</i>

<p>(11:4) The spirit asked Nephi if he believed that his dad saw the tree?

<p><i>"And the Spirit said unto me: Believest thou that thy father saw the tree of which he hath spoken?"</i>

<p>(11:5) Nephi said that he believed all the crazy shit his dad said.

<p><i>"And I said: Yea, thou knowest that I believe all the words of my father."</i>

<p>(11:6) When the spirit heard Nephi's words, it started screaming.

<p><i>"And when I had spoken these words, the Spirit cried with a loud voice, saying: Hosanna to the Lord, the most high God; 
for he is God over all the earth, yea, even above all. And blessed art thou, Nephi, because thou believest in the Son of the 
most high God; wherefore, thou shalt behold the things which thou hast desired."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif" > (11:7) ... bare record that this is the Son of God. -- 
<a href="../../jn/1.html#34">Jn.1:34</a>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (11:7-8)

<p>(11:7) The spirit shouted that because Nephi believes in his dad's cool tree, 
Jesus would come down from heaven to visit him. (Jesus believes in Lehi's tree, too.)

<p><i>"And behold this thing shall be given unto thee for a sign, that after thou hast beheld the tree which bore the fruit which thy 
father tasted, thou shalt also behold a man descending out of heaven, and him shall ye witness; and after ye have witnessed him ye shall 
bear record that it is the Son of God."</i>

<p>(11:8) And then it came to pass that the spirit showed Nephi his dad's magic 
fruit tree. It was exceedingly white, too. It was like the whitest thing he'd ever seen. 

<p><i>"And it came to pass that the Spirit said unto me: Look! And I looked and beheld a tree; and it was like unto the tree which my 
father had seen ... the whiteness thereof did exceed the 
whiteness of the driven snow."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif">
<img src="../../images/int.gif"> 
<img src="../../images/wom1.gif">(11:13) Nephi sees an exceedingly white virgin. (Being white is exceedingly good in the Book of Mormon.)
But how the hell would Nephi know that the exceedingly white woman was a virgin? I guess Nephi could spot a 
virgin from 400 kilometers away.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that ... in the city of Nazareth I beheld a virgin, and she was exceedingly fair and white."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/changes.gif" > (11:18) Behold, the virgin whom thou seest is the mother of God.
 -- <a href="http://carm.org/religious-movements/mormonism/1-nephi">1830 Book of Mormon</a>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" >
<img src="../../images/sex1.gif" > (11:18) After the spirit showed Nephi the exceedingly white tree and virgin, 
it blathered on a bit about "the condescension of God" and whatnot. Then it told Nephi that the white virgin "is the mother of the Son 
of God, after the manner of the flesh." (Does this mean that God the Father had sex with Mary "after the manner of the flesh?")

<p><i>"And he said unto me: Behold, the virgin whom thou seest is the mother of the Son of God, after the manner of the flesh."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (11:19-35) Then the spirit (or its angel sidekick) showed Nephi all the shit his 
dad saw and more. Jesus, Mary, John the Baptist, the twelve apostles, the crucifixion, a bunch of angels, Lehi's magic tree, fountain 
of living waters, iron rod, the large and spacious building, angels, devils, the condescension of God, the lamb of God, the Holy Ghost, 
devils, unclean spirits, the wisdom of the world -- the works.

beauty; and <span class="a">the whiteness thereof did exceed the whiteness of the driven snow. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="9">11:9</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> after I had seen 
the tree, I said unto the Spirit: I behold thou hast shown unto me the tree which is 
precious above all. 

<tr><td><b><a name="10">11:10</b></a>   And he said unto me: What desirest thou? 

<tr><td><b><a name="11">11:11</b></a>   And I said unto him: To know the interpretation 
thereof -- for I spake unto him as a man speaketh; for I beheld that he was in the form 
of a man; yet nevertheless, I knew that it was the Spirit of the Lord; and he spake unto 
me as a man speaketh with another. 

<tr><td><b><a name="12">11:12</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that he said 
unto me: Look!  And I looked as if to look upon him, and I saw him not; for he had gone 
from before my presence. 

<tr><td><b><a name="13">11:13</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that</span> I looked 
and beheld the great city of Jerusalem, and also other cities.  And I beheld the city of 
Nazareth; and <span class="a">in the city of Nazareth I beheld a virgin, and she was 
exceedingly fair and white.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="14">11:14</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that I saw the 
heavens open; and an angel came down and stood before me; and he said unto me: Nephi, what 
beholdest thou? 

<tr><td><b><a name="15">11:15</b></a>   And I said unto him: A virgin, most 
beautiful and fair above all other virgins. 


<tr><td><b><a name="16">11:16</b></a>   And he said unto me: Knowest thou the condescension of 
God? 

<tr><td><b><a name="17">11:17</b></a>   And I said unto him: I know that he loveth his children; 
nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things. 

<tr><td><b><a name="18">11:18</b></a>   <span class="a">And he said unto me: </span><span class="plag">Behold, the virgin whom thou seest is 
the mother of the Son of God</span>, <span class="s">after the manner of the flesh. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="19">11:19</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that I beheld 
that she was carried away in the Spirit; and after she had been carried away in the Spirit 
for the space of a time the angel spake unto me, saying: Look! 

<tr><td><b><a name="20">11:20</b></a>   And I looked and beheld the virgin again, bearing a child 
in her arms. 

<tr><td><b><a name="21">11:21</b></a>   And the angel said unto me: <span class="plag">Behold 
the Lamb of God, yea, even the Son of the Eternal Father!</span>  Knowest thou the meaning of the tree which thy father 
saw? 

<tr><td><b><a name="22">11:22</b></a>   And I answered him, saying: Yea, <span class="plag">it is 
the love of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts</span> of the children of men; 
wherefore, it is the most desirable above all things. 

<tr><td><b><a name="23">11:23</b></a>   And he spake unto me, saying: Yea, and the most joyous to 
the soul. 

<tr><td><b><a name="24">11:24</b></a>   And after he had said these words, he said unto me: 
Look!   And I looked, and I beheld the Son of God going forth among the children of men; 
and I saw many fall down at his feet and worship him. 

<tr><td><b><a name="25">11:25</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that I beheld 
that the rod of iron, which my father had seen, was the word of God, which led to the 
fountain of living waters, or to the tree of life; which waters are a representation of 
the love of God; and I also beheld that the tree of life was a representation of the love 
of God. 

<tr><td><b><a name="26">11:26</b></a>   And the angel said unto me again: Look and behold the 
condescension of God! 

<tr><td><b><a name="27">11:27</b></a>   And I looked and beheld the Redeemer of the world, of 
whom my father had spoken; and I also beheld the prophet who should prepare the way before 
him.  And the Lamb of God went forth and was baptized of him; and after he was baptized, I 
beheld the heavens open, and the Holy Ghost come down out of heaven and abide upon him in 
the form of a dove. 

<tr><td><b><a name="28">11:28</b></a>   And I beheld that he went forth ministering unto the 
people, in power and great glory; and the multitudes were gathered together to hear him; 
and I beheld that they cast him out from among them. 

<tr><td><b><a name="29">11:29</b></a>   And I also beheld twelve others following 
him.  <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they were carried away in the Spirit 
from before my face, and I saw them not. 

<tr><td><b><a name="30">11:30</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the angel 
spake unto me again, saying: Look!  And I looked, and I beheld the heavens open again, and 
I saw angels descending upon the children of men; and they did minister unto them. 

<tr><td><b><a name="31">11:31</b></a>   And he spake unto me again, saying: Look!  And I looked, 
and I beheld the Lamb of God going forth among the children of men.   And I beheld 
multitudes of people who were sick, and who were afflicted with all manner of diseases, and 
with devils and unclean spirits; and the angel spake and showed all these things unto me.  
And they were healed by the power of the Lamb of God; and the devils and the unclean spirits 
were cast out. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="32">11:32</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the angel 
spake unto me again, saying: Look!  And I looked and beheld the Lamb of God, that he was 
taken by the people; <span class="plag">yea, the Son of the everlasting God was judged of the 
world</span>; and I saw and bear record. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

I beheld that they were in a large and spacious building, like unto the building which my
