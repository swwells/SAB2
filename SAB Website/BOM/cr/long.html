<OL>
<h4>1 Nephi</h4>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../1ne/cr.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p><li>The Spirit of the Lord "constrained" Nephi to murder Laban as he lay passed out on the ground. <a href="../1ne/4.html#10">4:10</a>

<p><li>But the Spirit had to tell Nephi again. <a href="../1ne/4.html#11">4:11</a>

<p><li>And a third time, reminding Nephi that God kills people too (so it must be OK) and besides, it's better that one person die 
than a whole nation dwindle in unbelief. <a href="../1ne/4.html#12">4:12-13</a>

<p><li>So Nephi (finally) obeys the Spirit by grabbing Laban by the hair and chopping off his head with his own sword. 
<a href="../1ne/4.html#18">4:18</a>
 
 <p><li>God's wrath is on the Native Americans who were slaughtered by the Europeans. <a href="../1ne/13.html#14">13:14</a>
 
 <p><li>God inspired the Europeans (who "were white, and exceedingly fair and beautiful" just like Nephi's descendants before the evil, 
dark-skinned  Lamanites killed them all ) to slaughter the Native Americans. <a href="../1ne/13.html#15">13:15</a>
 
<p><li>If you're a gentile, you've only got two choices: become a Mormon or fall into the Catholic pit that leads to hell. 
<a href="../1ne/14.html#5">14:5-6</a>

<p><li>The angel tells Nephi that the lamb of God (Jesus) says that the time will come (2423 years later) when a 17 year old treasure 
digger from New York (Joseph Smith) will find some golden plates and translate them by staring into his hat at some magic rocks and 
thereby produce the "great and marvelous work" that we now know as the Book of Mormon. This book is, according to the angel, the best 
and most important book by far that you, me, or anyone else will ever read. And we'll be tortured forever after we die unless 
we believe it. <a href="../1ne/14.html#7">14:7</a>

<p><li>God hated pretty much everyone on earth (they were all just a bunch of Catholics to him) until the Mormons showed up. 
<a href="../1ne/14.html#15">14:15-17</a>

<p><li>There's an "awful gulf" that separates the wicked from the saints.
 <a href="../1ne/15.html#28">15:28</a>
 
<p><li>There's an "awful hell" prepared for the wicked. <a href="../1ne/15.html#29">15:29</a>

<p><li>There's an "awful hell" prepared by the devil. <a href="../1ne/15.html#35">15:35</a>

<p><li>God destroys entire nations of "wicked" people and curses the land for their sakes.
 <a href="../1ne/17.html#37">17:37-38</a>
 
 <p><li>Among many other things, Nephi told his brothers that God 
punishes complainers by sending fiery flying serpents to bite and kill them. (See <a href="../../num/21.html#6">Numbers 21:6</a>) 
<a href="../1ne/17.html#41">17:41</a>
 
<p><li>God will force people to eat their own flesh and drink their own blood. <a href="../1ne/21.html#26">21:26</a>

<p><li>The members of "the great and abominable church" (the whore of all the earth) will kill each other and 
get drunk on their own blood. <a href="../1ne/22.html#13">22:13</a>

<p><li>All those that fight again Zion (Mormonism), like "that great whore, that great and abominable church" 
will be destroyed. <a href="../1ne/22.html#14">22:14</a>

<p><li>The day is soon coming when God's wrath will be poured out and all proud, wicked people will be burned.
 <a href="../1ne/22.html#16">22:16-17</a>

<p><li>Those who do not believe in the Messiah (Jesus) will be destroyed by fires, storms, earthquakes, war, 
disease, and starvation. <a href="../2ne/6.html#15">6:15</a>

<p><li>God will force people to eat their own flesh and drink their own blood. <a href="../2ne/6.html#18">6:18</a>

<p><li>"The heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a
    garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner." (God plans to destroy the universe.)
    <a href="../2ne/8.html#6">8:6</a>

<p><li>Filthy people will be tormented forever in a lake of fire. <a href="../2ne/9.html#16">9:16</a>

<p><li>Hell is a lake of fire and brimstone where the damned are tormented forever. <a href="../2ne/9.html#19">9:19</a>, 
<a href="../2ne/9.html#26">9:26</a>

<p><li>Those who don't believe or who are not baptized will be damned to hell. <a href="../2ne/9.html#24">9:24</a>

<p><li>"Many of our children shall perish in the flesh because of unbelief." <a href="../2ne/10.html#2">10:2</a>

<p><li>To punish them for their iniquities, God sent famines, disease, wars, and destruction on the Jews.
 <a href="../2ne/10.html#6">10:6</a>
 
<p><li>God will make sweet smelling things stink, make people bald, and cause men to die in wars. 
<a href="../2ne/13.html#24">13:24-25</a>

<p><li>After God "washed away the filth" from the women and killed the men, he set up 
"a cloud and smoke by day" and a "flaming fire by night." <a href="../2ne/14.html#4">14:4-5</a>

<p><li>If you associate or gird yourself, God will break you in pieces. <a href="../2ne/18.html#9">18:9</a>

<p><li>God will not have mercy on orphans or widows. <a href="../2ne/19.html#17">19:17</a>

<p><li>God will make every man kill his brother and then force him to eat "the flesh of his own arm."
 <a href="../2ne/19.html#19">19:19-20</a>
 
<p><li>God will "smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall slay the
wicked." God must have some pretty bad breath! <a href="../2ne/21.html#4">21:4</a>

<p><li>On God's special day he will kill sinners with great anger, wrath, and cruelty. <a href="../2ne/23.html#6">23:6-9</a>

<p><li>If God can find you, he will "thrust you through," smash your children "to pieces" before your eyes,
and rape your wife. <a href="../2ne/23.html#15">23:15-18</a>

<p><li>Children will be slaughtered for the iniquities of their fathers. <a href="../2ne/24.html#21">24:21</a>

<p><li>Those who are proud will be burned to death by God. <a href="../2ne/26.html#4">26:4</a>

<p><li>Those who kill saints and prophets will be swallowed by the earth, covered with mountains, carried away by 
whirlwinds, crushed by falling buildings, destroyed by thunder, lightening, earthquakes, and fire.
 <a href="../2ne/26.html#5">26:5-6</a>
 
<p><li>God will get the Gentiles to kill all those who "dwindle in unbelief." <a href="../2ne/26.html#19">26:19</a>

<p><li>Death, hell, the devil, and the "endless torment" of "the lake of fire and brimstone."
 <a href="../2ne/28.html#23">28:23</a>
 
<p><li>God will "smite the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath of his mouth he shall slay the wicked." 
How's <I>that</I> for some bad breath? <a href="../2ne/30.html#9">30:9</a>

<p><li>God must burn wicked people to death. (I guess he has no choice in the matter.) <a href="../2ne/30.html#10">30:10</a>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="54530" endspan --><h4>Jacob</h4>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../jacob/cr.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p><li>God casts some people into a "lake of fire and brimstone" where they suffer "the pains of hell."
 <a href="../jacob/3.html#11">3:11</a>
 
<p><li>God commanded Abraham to kill his son Isaac. (And that was a good thing?) <a href="../jacob/4.html#5">4:5</a>

<p><li>God will curse some people and burn the world with fire. <a href="../jacob/6.html#3">6:3</a>

<p><li>Those who "bring forth evil fruit" will be "cast into the fire." <a href="../jacob/6.html#7">6:7</a>

<p><li>God will cast some people into a lake of fire and brimstone where he will torment them forever.
 <a href="../jacob/6.html#10">6:10</a>
 
 <p><li>Sherem, the first freethought martyr in the Book of Mormon [see the story of Korihor for another 
(<a href="../alma/30.html#12">Alma 30</a>)], tells Jacob he is misleading the people in by telling them 
(ca. 500 BCE) that Christ will be coming "many hundred years hence." <a href="../jacob/7.html#1">7:1-7</a>
 
<p><li>Jacob asks Sherem if he denies that Christ will come. Sherem answers that although he doesn't believe it now, 
he could be convinced if Jacob could show him a sign. Jacob responds by saying, "Thou art the devil ... but if 
God shall smite thee, let that be a sign unto thee."  <a href="../jacob/7.html#9">7:9-14</a>


<p><li>"He gave up the ghost."<br>
God gives Sherem a little sign: he kills him. <a href="../jacob/7.html#15">7:15-20</a>

<p><li>"This thing was pleasing to me."<br>
Jacob is pleased that God killed Sherem. <a href="../jacob/7.html#22">7:22</a>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="28194" endspan --><h4>Mosiah</h4>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../mosiah/cr.html" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p><li>"They also took of the firstlings of their flocks, that they might offer sacrifice and burnt offerings according to the law of Moses."
Why don't Mormons still offer animal sacrifices? <a href="../mosiah/2.html#3">2:3</a>

<p><li>Those who die in their sins are tormented forever in hell. <a href="../mosiah/2.html#:33">2:33</a>

<p><li>Those in hell "endure a never-ending torment." <a href="../mosiah/2.html#39">2:39</a>

<p><li>The damned are in a state of misery and endless torment. <a href="../mosiah/3.html#25">3:25-27</a>

<p><li>God answers the Nephites prayers, and helps them kill 3043 Lamanites in one day and a night.
 <a href="../mosiah/9.html#18">9:18</a>
 
<p><li>The Nephites drove the Lamanites away, killing them with "a great slaughter". They killed so many that 
they couldn't count them all. <a href="../mosiah/10.html#:20">10:20</a>

<p><li>The Lord says that this (which?) generation will be slain and their bodies will be eaten by vultures, dogs, 
and wild beasts. <a href="../mosiah/12.html#2">12:2</a>

<p><li>God will smite his people with sore afflictions, famine, pestilence, and will cause them to howl all 
the day long. <a href="../mosiah/12.html#4">12:4</a>

<p><li>Those who don't know Christ will be thrown into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels.

 <p><li>"What he had taught to the people was contrary to the word of God; and there he suffered an 
ignominious death."<br>
Nehor was killed for teaching the heresy of universalism. <a href="../alma/1.html#4">1:4</a>, 
<a href="../alma/1.html#15">15</a>

<p><li>Those who refuse to kill a murderer must have his blood fall upon them.
 <a href="../alma/1.html#13">1:13</a>
 
<p><li>God helped the Nephites slaughter 12,532 Amlicites. <a href="../alma/2.html#18">2:18-19</a>

<p><li>The Lord did hear their cries [he had his hearing aid on], ... and the Lamanites and Amlicites did fall 
before them. <a href="../alma/2.html#18">2:28</a>

<p><li>God will destroy those who don't repent. <a href="../alma/8.html#16">8:16</a>, <a href="../alma/9.html#12">9:12</a>

<p><li>Some people will be tortured forever in the fires of hell. <a href="../alma/12.html#17">12:17</a>

<p><li>"The Spirit constraineth me."><br>
Alma refuses to ask God to prevent the burning to death of women and children. It is "the will of the 
Lord." <a href="../alma/14.html#8">14:8-13</a>

<p><li>Ammon killed "a certain number" of people with his sling. <a href="../alma/17.html#36">17:36</a>

<p><li>Ammon smote off their arms with his sword. <a href="../alma/17.html#37">17:37-38</a>

<p><li>Ammon carried the arms that he had cut off to show to the king. <a href="../alma/17.html#39">17:39</a>

<p><li>"Tens of thousands of Lamanites (Native Americans) were slain and scattered abroad."
 <a href="../alma/28.html#2">28:2</a>
 
<p><li>The bodies of "many thousands" were left to rot on the ground. <a href="../alma/28.html#11">28:11</a>

<p><li>So many died in the religious war that the dead bodies couldn't be counted. 
<a href="../alma/30.html#2">30:2</a>

<p><li>Since Alma can't refute Korihor's arguments, he says he'll have God smite him so that he can no longer 
speak. It's better, he says, that Korihor's soul be lost than that he convince others that there is no God.
 <a href="../alma/30.html#47">30:47</a>
 
<p><li>Korihor "was struck dumb ... according to the words of Alma." <a href="../alma/30.html#50">30:50</a>

<p><li>"The curse was not taken off of Korihor; but he was  cast out, and went about from house to house 
begging for his food." <a href="../alma/30.html#56">30:56</a>

<p><li>The chief judge warned everyone not to believe Korihor or they will also be struck dumb and be forced to 
beg for their food. <a href="../alma/30.html#57">30:57</a>

<p><li>Korihor was trampled upon by the Nephites until he was dead.
 <a href="../alma/30.html#59">30:59</a>
 
<p><li>If you ask God to kill your enemies, he will do it for you. <a href="../alma/33.html#10">33:10</a>

<p><li>Evil people are those who "have no part or portion of the Spirit of the Lord." They will be 
"cast out into outer darkness; there shall be weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth."
 <a href="../alma/40.html#13">40:13</a>
 
<p><li>God is with Moroni and the Nephites. The Lord has delivered the Lamanites into their hands "because of [their] 
religion and [their] faith in Christ." <a href="../alma/44.html#3">44:3</a>

<p><li>"Now ye see that this is the true faith of God." (You can tell by all the nonbelievers they kill.)
 <a href="../alma/44.html#4">44:4</a>
 
<p><li>In the war with the Lamanites, God is on the Nephites side. He just likes their religion better.
 <a href="../alma/44.html#5">44:5</a>
 
 <p><li> Moroni's soldiers perform a live scalping to frighten their enemies. <a href="../alma/44.html#12">44:12-15</a>
 
<p><li>Moroni gets angry and orders his people to kill the Lamanites, which was exceedingly easy since they were all naked 
as jaybirds. <a href="../alma/44.html#17">44:17-18</a>

<p><li>If the Nephites forsake God, then God will tear them to pieces. <a href="../alma/46.html#21">46:21</a>

<p><li>The Nephites make a deal with God. If they fail to follow God properly, then God can kill them all.
 <a href="../alma/46.html#22">46:22</a>
 
<p><li>Those who will not support the cause of freedom are put to death. (The Bush Doctrine?)
 <a href="../alma/46.html#35">46:35</a>
 
 <p><li>Moroni writes a petition empowering him "to compel those dissenters to defend their country or 
to put them to death." <a href="../alma/51.html#15">51:15</a>
 
<p><li>Four thousand dissenters were "hewn down by the sword." <a href="../alma/51.html#19">51:19</a>

<p><li> Teancum snuck into the king's tent and stuck a javelin into his heart. 
<a href="../alma/51.html#34">51:34</a>

<p><li>There is an "awful hell that awaits" those who fail to repent. <a href="../alma/54.html#7">54:7</a>

<p><li>Moroni threatens to kill all the Lamanites, taking "blood for blood" and "life for life."
 <a href="../alma/54.html#12">54:12</a>
 
<p><li>The Nephites kill two thousand Lamanites after they had surrenedered as prisoners of war.
 <a href="../alma/57.html#14">57:14</a>
 
<p><li>Moroni executed "those king-men" who refused to fight for their country. 
<a href="../alma/62.html#9">62:9</a>

<p><li>"Whosoever was found denying their freedom was speedily executed." <a href="../alma/62.html#10">62:10</a>

<p><li>Moroni "inflicted death upon all those who were not true to the cause of freedom." 
<a href="../alma/62.html#11">62:11</a>

<p><li>	Moroni kills many of the Lamanites as they try to escape. <a href="../alma/62.html#25">62:25-26</a>

<p><li>Teancum sneaks into the Lamanite's camp and throws a javelin into the king's heart. 
<a href="../alma/62.html#36">62:36</a>

<p><li>Moroni and the Nephites slay the Lamanites "with a great slaughter." <a href="../alma/62.html#38">62:38</a>
