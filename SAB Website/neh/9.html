  Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them into

  <tr><td><B><A name="23">9:23</A></B>

  <tr><td><B><A name="24">9:24</A></B>
  So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before

    them as they would.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="25">9:25</A></B>
  And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of

    abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted
    themselves in thy great goodness.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="26">9:26</A></B>
  Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast
    thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which testified against
    them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="27">9:27</A></B>
  Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed
    them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou

  But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore

    heardest them from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according
    to thy mercies;<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

    sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;)
    and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="30">9:30</A></B>
  Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by

  Nevertheless for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not utterly consume

  Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who
    keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before thee,
    that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests,
    and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the
    time of the kings of Assyria unto this day.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="33">9:33</A></B>
  Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast done

  Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept

    thou didst testify against them.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="35">9:35</A></B>
  For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness
    that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest
    before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="36">9:36</A></B>
  Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou gavest unto
    our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are
    servants in it:<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><B><A name="37">9:37</A></B>
  And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us
    because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our

  <tr><td><B><A name="38">9:38</A></B>
  And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our
