Jacob is tricked by Laban, the
father of Rachel and Leah. After working seven years, Jacob asks for Rachel so that he can &quot;go in unto
her.&quot; But Laban gives him Leah instead, and Jacob &quot;went in unto her
[Leah]&quot; by mistake. Jacob was fooled until morning -- apparently he didn't
know who he was going in unto. Finally they worked things out and Jacob got to
&quot;go in unto&quot; Rachel, too. (After working another seven years for Laban.)
