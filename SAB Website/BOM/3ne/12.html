<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>12:27</b>   Behold, it is written by them of old time, that thou shalt not commit adultery; <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>12:28</b>   But I say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman, to lust after her, hath committed adultery 
already in his heart. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>12:29</b>   Behold, I give unto you a commandment, that ye suffer none of these things to enter into your 
heart; <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>12:30</b>   For it is better that ye should deny yourselves of these things, wherein ye will take up your 
cross, than that ye should be cast into hell. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>12:31</b>   It hath been written, that whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of 
divorcement. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="32"></a>12:32</b>   Verily, verily, I say unto you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of 
fornication, causeth her to commit adultery; and whoso shall marry her who is divorced committeth adultery. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="33"></a>12:33</b>   And again it is written, thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine 
oaths; <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="34"></a>12:34</b>   But verily, verily, I say unto you, swear not at all; neither by heaven, for it is God's 
throne; <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="35"></a>12:35</b>   Nor by the earth, for it is his footstool; <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="36"></a>12:36</b>   Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair black or white; <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="37"></a>12:37</b>   But let your communication be Yea, yea; Nay, nay; for whatsoever cometh of more than these is 
evil. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="38"></a>12:38</b>   And behold, it is written, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth; <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="39"></a>12:39</b>   But I say unto you, that ye shall not resist evil, but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right 
cheek, turn to him the other also; <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="40"></a>12:40</b>   And if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also; <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="41"></a>12:41</b>   And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="42"></a>12:42</b>   Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not away. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="43"></a>12:43</b>   And behold it is written also, that thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy; <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="44"></a>12:44</b>   But I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, 
and pray for them who despitefully use you and persecute you; <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="45"></a>12:45</b>   That ye may be the children of your Father who is in heaven; for he maketh his sun to rise on 
the evil and on the good. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="46"></a>12:46</b>   Therefore those things which were of old time, which were under the law, in me are all fulfilled. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="47"></a>12:47</b>   Old things are done away, and all things have become new. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>

<tr><td><b><a name="48"></a>12:48</b>   Therefore I would that ye should be perfect even as I, or your Father who is in heaven is 
perfect. <td bgcolor="eeeeee"></tr>
