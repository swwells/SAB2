Lord their God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>26:5</b>   And now in the reign of Mosiah they were not half so numerous as the people of God; but because of the 
dissensions among the brethren they became more numerous. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>26:6</b>   For <span class="a">it came to pass</span> that they did deceive many with their flattering words, who were in the church, 
and did cause them to commit many sins; therefore it became expedient that those who committed sin, that were in the 
church, should be admonished by the church. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>26:7</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they were brought before the priests, and delivered 
up unto the priests by the teachers; and the priests brought them before Alma, who was the high priest. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>26:9</b>   <span class="a">And 
it came to pass</span> that Alma did not know concerning them; but there were many witnesses against them; yea, the 
people stood and testified of their iniquity in abundance. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>26:10</b>   Now there had not any such thing happened before in the church; therefore Alma was troubled in his 
spirit, and he caused that they should be brought before the king. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>26:11</b>   And he said unto the king: Behold, here are many whom we have brought before thee, who are accused of 
their brethren; yea, and they have been taken in divers iniquities.  And they do not repent of their iniquities; 
therefore we have brought them before thee, that thou mayest judge them according to their crimes. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>26:12</b>   But king Mosiah said unto Alma: Behold, I judge them not; therefore I deliver them into thy hands to 
be judged. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>26:13</b>   And now the spirit of Alma was again troubled; and he went and inquired of the Lord what he should 
do concerning this matter, for he feared that he should do wrong in the sight of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
