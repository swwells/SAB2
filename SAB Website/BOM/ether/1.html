The brother of Jared was a large, mighty (but apparently nameless*) man who was "highly favored of the Lord." He cried to the 
Lord (two times) and the Lord spared the Jaredites from having their language confounded.

<p>*Although he was nameless in the Book of Mormon, he was later given the name 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brother_of_Jared">Mahonri Moriancumer</a> by Joseph 
Smith. With a name like that I can see why he was called "the brother of Jared"!
