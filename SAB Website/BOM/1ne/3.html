(3:1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 21, 22, 24, 25,26, 27, 28, 29) 

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (3:1) <i>"And it came to pass that I, 
Nephi, returned from speaking with the Lord."</i><br>
See <a href="2.html#19">1 Nephi 2:19-24</a> for Nephi's little chat with God.

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif" > (3:2) Behold, I dreamed a dream 
-- <a href="../../jg/7.html#13">Judges 7:13</a>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (3:2-4) God commands Lehi in a dream to send his sons back to Jerusalem 
(800+ km roundtrip) to get Lehi's genealogy that is written on brass plates

<p><i>"Behold, I dreamed a dream in the which the Lord hath 
commanded me that thou and thy brethren shall return to Jerusalem. For behold, Laban hath the record of the Jews and also a 
genealogy of my forefathers, and they are engraven upon plates of brass ... Go unto 
the house of Laban, and seek the records, and bring them down hither into the wilderness."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > 
<a href="exceed_list.html">Exceedingly</a> (3:8, 14, 25)

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (3:10-21)

<p>(3:10-11a) So the four brothers went back to Jerusalem. Now they just needed to 
decide how to get the brass plates back from Laban. Luckily, they had all read the Bible so they knew the proper way of deciding 
such things. They cast lots. 

<p><i>"And it came to pass that when we had gone up to the land of Jerusalem ... we cast lots -- who of us 
should go in unto the house of Laban."</i>

<p>(3:11b-13) The lot fell upon Laman, so he went in to talk to 
Laban about the plates. But Laban refused to give him the plates, accused him of trying to rob him, and threatened to kill him. 

<p><i>"And it came to pass that the lot fell upon Laman; and Laman 
went in unto the house of Laban ... And behold, it came to pass that Laban was angry, and thrust him out from his presence; 
and he would not that he should have the records.  Wherefore, he said unto him: Behold thou art a robber, and I will slay thee.."</i>

<p>(3:14) After that, Laman, Lemuel, and Sam wanted to give up on the plates 
and return "to the wilderness." 

<p><i>"But Laman fled out of his presence, and told the things 
which Laban had done, unto us. And we began to be exceedingly sorrowful, and my brethren 
were about to return unto my father in the wilderness."</i>

<p>(3:15-21) <br>But Nephi talked them out of it 
in a long, boring speech. 

<p><i>"But behold I said unto them that: As the Lord liveth, and as we live, we will not go down unto our father in the 
wilderness until we have accomplished the thing which the Lord hath commanded us.<br>
...<br>
And it came to pass that after this manner of language did I persuade my brethren, that they might be faithful in keeping the 
commandments of God."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif" > (3:20) 
Spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began -- <a href="../../acts/3.html#21">Acts.3:21</a>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (3:22-31)

<p>(3:22-24) So Nephi and his brothers go get their father's gold, silver, 
and precious things (that were left behind on their wilderness trip), brought them to Laban, and offered to trade it all for the plates.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that we ... did gather together our gold, and our silver, and our precious things ... And it came to pass that 
we went in unto Laban, and desired him that he would give unto us the records 
which were engraven upon the plates of brass, for which we would give unto him our gold, and our silver, and all our precious things."</i>

<p>(3:25) Laban wanted their gold and whatnot but he also wanted to keep 
the plates. (He was into genealogy, too.) So he decided to kill them and take their stuff.

<p><i>"And it came to pass that when Laban saw our property, and that it was exceedingly great, he did lust after it, insomuch that he 
thrust us out, and sent his servants to slay us, that he might obtain our property."</i>

<p>(3:26-27) Nephi and his brothers escaped to the wilderness and hid in "the 
cavity of a rock."

<p><i>"And it came to pass that we did flee and ... were obliged to leave behind our property, and it fell 
into the hands of Laban. And it came to pass that we fled into the wilderness, and the servants of Laban did not overtake us, 
and we hid ourselves in the cavity of a rock."</i>

<p>(3:28) Laman and Lemuel had had enough. They started to beat Sam and Nephi 
with a rod.
 
 <p><i>"Laman and Lemuel did speak many hard 
 words unto us, their younger brothers, and they did smite us even with a rod."</i>

<p>(3:29) Then an angel showed up and told them to stop beating Nephi.

<p><i>"Behold, an angel of the Lord came and stood before them, and he spake unto them, 
saying: Why do ye smite your younger brother with a rod?"</i>

<p>(3:31)<br> But Laman and Lemuel weren't convinced by the angel. 

<p><i>"And after the angel had departed, Laman and Lemuel again began to murmur, saying: How is it possible that the Lord will deliver Laban 
into our hands? Behold, he is a mighty man, and he can command fifty, yea, even he can slay fifty; then why not us?"</i>

<tr><td><b><a name="10">3:10</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that when we had gone up to the land of Jerusalem</span>, I and my 
brethren did consult one with another. 

<tr><td><b><a name="11">3:11</b></a>   <span class="a">And we cast lots -- who of us should go in unto the house of Laban. </span>
<span class="a">And it came to pass that the lot fell upon Laman; and Laman went in unto the house of Laban</span>, 
and he talked with him as he sat in his house. 

<tr><td><b><a name="12">3:12</b></a>   And he desired of Laban the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass, which contained the 
genealogy of my father. 

<tr><td><b><a name="13">3:13</b></a>   <span class="a">And behold, it came to pass that Laban was angry, and thrust him out from his 
presence; and he would not that he should have the records.  Wherefore, he said unto him: Behold thou art a robber, and 
I will slay thee.</span>

<tr><td><b><a name="14">3:14</b></a>   <span class="a">But Laman fled out of his presence, and told the things which Laban had done, unto us.  And we began to 
be exceedingly sorrowful, and my brethren were about to return unto my father in the wilderness. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="15">3:15</b></a>   <span class="a">But behold I said unto them that: As the Lord liveth, and as we live, we will not go down unto our 
father in the wilderness until we have accomplished the thing which the Lord hath commanded us. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="16">3:16</b></a>   Wherefore, let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord; therefore let us go down to the 
land of our father's inheritance, for behold he left gold and silver, and all manner of riches.  And all this he hath 
done because of the commandments of the Lord. 

<tr><td><b><a name="17">3:17</b></a>   For he knew that Jerusalem must be destroyed, because of the wickedness of the people. 

<tr><td><b><a name="18">3:18</b></a>   For behold, they have rejected the words of the prophets.   Wherefore, if my father should dwell in the 
land after he hath been commanded to flee out of the land, behold, he would also perish.  Wherefore, it must needs be 
that he flee out of the land. 

<tr><td><b><a name="19">3:19</b></a>   And behold, it is wisdom in God that we should obtain these records, that we may preserve unto our 
children the language of our fathers; 

<tr><td><b><a name="20">3:20</b></a>   And also that we may preserve unto them the words 
which have been <span class="plag">spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets</span>, which 
have been delivered unto them by the Spirit and power of God, <span class="plag">since the 
world began</span>, even down unto this present time. 

<tr><td><b><a name="21">3:21</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that after this manner of language did I persuade my 
brethren, that they might be faithful in keeping the commandments of God. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="22">3:22</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that we</span> went down to the land of our inheritance, and we 
<span class="a">did gather together our gold, and our silver, and our precious things. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="23">3:23</b></a>   And after we had gathered these things together, we went up 
again unto the house of Laban. 

<tr><td><b><a name="24">3:24</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that we went in unto Laban, and desired him that he would 
give unto us the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass, for which we would give unto him our gold, and 
our silver, and all our precious things. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="25">3:25</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that when Laban saw our property, and that it was 
exceedingly great, he did lust after it, insomuch that he thrust us out, and sent his servants to slay us, that he might
 obtain our property. </span>
 
<tr><td><b><a name="26">3:26</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that we did flee</span> before the servants of Laban, 
<span class="a">and we were obliged to leave behind our property, and it fell into the hands of Laban. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="27">3:27</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass that we fled into the wilderness, and the servants of Laban 
did not overtake us, and we hid ourselves in the cavity of a rock. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="28">3:28</b></a>   And it came to pass that Laman was angry with me, and also with my father; and 
also was Lemuel, for he hearkened unto the words of Laman.  Wherefore <span class="a">Laman and Lemuel did speak many hard words unto 
us, their younger brothers, and they did smite us even with a rod. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="29">3:29</b></a>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> as they smote us with a rod, <span class="a">behold, 
an angel of the Lord came and stood before them, and he spake unto them, saying: Why do ye smite your younger brother with a rod?</span>   Know ye 
not that the Lord hath chosen him to be a ruler over you, and this because of your iniquities?  Behold ye shall go up 
to Jerusalem again, and the Lord will deliver Laban into your hands. 

<tr><td><b><a name="30">3:30</b></a>   And after the angel had spoken unto us, he departed.

<tr><td><b><a name="31">3:31</b></a>   <span class="a">And after the angel had departed, Laman and Lemuel again began to murmur, saying: How is it possible 
that the Lord will deliver Laban into our hands?  Behold, he is a mighty man, and he can command fifty, yea, even he 
can slay fifty; then why not us? </span>
