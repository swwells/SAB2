<p><li>"My father ... taught me in his language."<br>
Enos' father (Jacob) taught him in his language -- which, of course, was reformed Egyptian. (All native Americans spoke reformed Egyptian in 500 BCE.) <a href="1.html#1">1:1</a>

<p><li>A Cmimeter is a curved sword with the sharp edge on the convex side. This type of sword did not exist at  the time 
Enos was supposedly written (ca. 500 BCE). Indeed there is no evidence that swords of any kind existed in pre-Columbian 
America. <a href="1.html#20">1:20</a>

<p><li>The Nephites planted "all manner of grain" and all manner of cattle, goats, and horses. (Cattle, horses, 
and European grains were absent in pre-Columbian North America.) <a href="1.html#21">1:21</a>
