<tr><td width="50%"><h3>Judges 15</h3>
<td bgcolor="eeeeee" rowspan="21">

 <font size="-1">
 <img src="../images/abs1.gif">
 <img src="../images/interp.gif"> (15:1) After <a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2009/11/gods-51st-killing-samsons-riddle-and.html">the spirit of the Lord 
 came upon Samson and he murdered 30 men for their clothes</a>, he went to his wife's house for some sex. He even 
 brought a young goat along to pay for her services. [The New Oxford Annotated Bible says that a young goat was "the usual gift for sexual intercourse." 
 (<a href="../gen/38.html#17">Gen.38:17</a>) OK, that may have been true for prostitutes, but did you have to give your wife a goat every time you had sex?]
 
<p>(15:1a) <i>"Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber."</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif">
 <img src="../images/wom1.gif"> 
 <img src="../images/fv.gif"> (15:1b-2) Then Samson's father-in-law had to tell him the bad news: he had given Samson's wife to one of his 
Philistine friends because he thought Samson "hated" her. 
 He suggested that Samson take his younger daughter instead, saying the younger one's prettier anyway. 

<p>(15:1b) <i>"But her father would not suffer him to go in."</i>
 
 <p>(15:2) <i>"And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: 
 is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her."</i>

<p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif">
    <IMG src="../images/inj1.gif">
    <IMG src="../images/cr1.gif"> (15:4-5) But Samson didn't want his wife's little sister. He wanted his wife back, because as you'll recall 
from <a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2009/11/gods-51st-killing-samsons-riddle-and.html">God's last killing</a>, "She pleased Samson well."

So Samson had an idea, an idea that only one of God's special heroes could come up with. He'd catch 300 foxes, tie their tails together, light them on 
fire, and set them loose in the Philistine's grain fields. 

<p>(15:4) <b> <i>"Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails."</i></b>

</b>

<p>(15:5) <b> <i>"And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go</b> into the standing corn of the Philistines."</i>

</b>

<p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif"> (15:6) But it didn't work out as planned. After the burning foxes destroyed the fields, the 
Philistines didn't 
give Samson his wife back; they burned her 
and her father to death. 

<p>(15:6) <i>"Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson ...

    <IMG src="../images/cr1.gif"> (15:7-8) In response, Samson smote the 
Philistines "hip and thigh" wit a great slaughter. (I'm not including this killing on God's list, since the Bible 
doesn't tell us that "the Spirit of the Lord cam upon him" or otherwise imply that God was involved.)

<p>(15:7) <i>"Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease."</i>

    created and filled a hollow in the very same jawbone and put water in it for Samson to drink.
    
    <p>(15:17) <i>"When he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand."</i>
    
    <p>(15:18) <i>"And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD,"</i>
