It took the Israelites 40 years to travel from Egypt to Canaan, yet such a journey, even at that time, 
would have taken no more than a few weeks.

The shoes and clothing of the Israelites
didn't wear out even after wandering in the wilderness for forty years. They
just don't make them like they used to!

If you serve the gods of other nations,  or decide to follow your own heart, "all the curses that are in 
this book" will fall upon you -- and that's a heck of a lot of curses! (See <a href="28.html#15">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>)

<p>(29:18) <i>"Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations,"</i>

<p>(29:19) <i>"When he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying,  I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart,"</i><br>

<p>(29:20a) <i>"The LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him."</i>

<p><img src="../images/interp.gif" > (29:20b) <i>"The LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven."</i><br>

    upon it;
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="23">29:23</A></B>
  And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that
    it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the
    overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD
