<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="introp.html" TAG="BODY" startspan --><i>"And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and
    divided her, together with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into
    all the coasts of Israel."</i> -- <a href="19.html#29">Judges 19:29</a>

<h2>Judges for Skeptics</h2>

<p>Judges is a violent book even by biblical standards. It begins by cutting off the thumbs and big toes of 
a captured king and ends with a genocide following the dismemberment of a concubine's body. Along the way it describes, with apparent relish and approval, 
a gruesome "message from God" (a knife blade stuck deeply into 
a fat man's belly); a tent stake driven through a sleeping man's skull; a couple of severed heads delivered to Gideon; the 
killing of 69 brothers upon a single stone; a daughter killed by her father as a sacrifice to God; 300 foxes tied 
together by their tails and lit on fire; 1000 men killed with a jawbone of an ass; and, in what is probably the most disgusting 
story in all literature, the rape and mutilation of the Levite's concubine. And I've left a lot out. Read it yourself, 
if you have a strong enough stomach. And be sure to check out:

  After Joshua died, the Israelites wondered who was going to do their killing for them. God told them not to worry; he had 
  selected the tribe of Judah to kill the Canaanites and steal their land. The first killing was easy, since God delivered them into their hand, killing 10,000  
 Canaanites and Perizzites. After the slaughter, they capture Adonibezek and "cut off his thumbs and great toes" to pay him back for doing the same to seventy other kings. 
 (Abonibezek fed his table scraps to seventy thumbless and big toe-less kings who lived under his dinner table.)<br>

  After the Jerusalem Massacre "the children of Judah" go on a God-assisted killing spree, wiping out  
  entire kingdoms "with the edge of the sword." It's hard to say how many cities were massacred, but there were at least five: three in Hebron, along with Zephath and Bethel.
  And there would have been a lot more, too, if it weren't for those damned iron chariots (v.19). Some things are just too hard, even for God. 
  
  <p>These killings also contain an important message about Biblical Family Values. In verses 12 and 13, God's special hero (Caleb) gave his daughter to the man who could 
  kill the most people. Now <i>that</i>'s family values for you!<br>

       This is just another variation on the same old story. If you've been following along, you know what's going to happen.

       <p>1. The Israelites do evil in the sight of the Lord.
       
       <p>(4:1) <i>"The children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD."</i>
       
       <p>2. God sells them into slavery.
       
       <p>(4:2) <i><b>"The Lord sold them</b> into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan."</i>
       
       <p>3. The Israelites cry out to the Lord.
       
       <p>(4:3) <i>"The children of Israel cried unto the LORD."</i>
       
       <p>4. Gold slaughters the people he sold the Israelites to. 
       
       <p>(4:15-16) <i>The LORD discomfited Sisera</i> [the captain of King Jabin’s army], <i>and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword … 
       and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left."</i>       
      
     
 <p>This story is more interesting than most, though, because one of the characters is named Barak. (Although Barack Obama's 
       first name is not derived from this biblical character, believers sometimes like to pretend otherwise.)
       
       <p>Here are the details.
       
       <p>After Ehud dies, a woman became the leader of the Israelites. Her name is Deborah and she is called a prophetess and judge. 
       She sat under a palm tree and everyone "came up to her for judgment." 
       
<p>(4:4-5) <i>"Deborah, a prophetess, ... dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah ... and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment."</i>  

<p>One day, she summoned Barak and told him to take 10,000 soldiers to fight Sisera.

<p>(4:6-7) <i>"She sent and called Barak ... and said ... the LORD God of Israel commanded, 
saying ... take with thee ten thousand men ... to ... Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army ... and I will deliver him into thine hand."</i>   

<p>Barak, who was a bit of a chicken shit, said: 

<p>(4:8) <i>"If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go."</i>

<p>Deborah said that she would go with him and that God would deliver Sisera into the hands of a woman.

<p>(4:9)  <i>"I will surely go with thee ... for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak."</i>

<p><IMG src="../images/contra1.gif" > (4:11) <i>"Hobab the father in law of Moses"</i><br>
    <a href="../contra/mosesfil.html">Who was Moses' father-in-law?</a>
    
    <p><img src="../images/contra1.gif">(4:13) <i>"Nine hundred chariots  of iron"</i><br>
    <a href="../contra/iron.html">Can God stop iron chariots?</a>
    
    <p>So Deborah and Barak go off to fight in God's holy war. Guess what happens.
    
    <p>(4:15) <i>"The LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet."</i>
    
    <p>(4:16) <i>"But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host... and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left."</i>
    
    <p>That's right. God confused ("discomfited") Sisera's army, forcing them to either kill each other or kill 
	themselves. No one survived -- except Sisera, and God will take care of him
    in his next killing.

        The Lord set every man's sword against his fellow</a></b><br>
        Here's a story about Gideon. You know, the guy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gideon_Bible">they</a> named the Bible after.
       
       <p>It starts out in the usual way. The Israelites do evil in the sight of the Lord (6:1a); God forces the Israelites to be slaves (6:1b); 
       the Israelites cry out to God (6:7); God kills the guys he delivered them to (7:22). (The Midianites this time around. 
       See <a href="2.html#14">Judges 2:14</a>, <a href="3.html#8">3:8</a>, and 
       <a href="8.html#6">8:6</a> for other versions of the same story.)
              
       <p>(6:1) <i>"The children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and 
       the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years."</i>

    the hand of Midian seven years.</span>     

  <tr><td><B><A name="2">6:2</A></B>
  And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the
    Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the
    mountains, and caves, and strong holds.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="3">6:3</A></B>
  And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the
    Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="4">6:4</A></B>

       <i>"They came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number."</i><br>
       Every male Midianite was killed during the time of 
       Moses (<a href="../num/31.html#7">Numbers 31:7</a>), and yet 200 years later 
       they flourish like grasshoppers "without number." <br>
       <a href="../contra/midian.html">Did the Israelites kill every male in Midian?</a>

  And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the
    children of Israel cried unto the LORD.
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="7">6:7</A></B>
  And it came to pass, when <span class="a">the children of Israel cried unto the LORD</span>
    because of the Midianites,
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="8">6:8</A></B>
  That the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto
    them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and
    brought you forth out of the house of bondage;<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
    
  <tr><td><B><A name="9">6:9</A></B>

    <font size="-1">
    <IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (6:11-12) An angel was sitting under an oak tree when he saw Gideon threshing some wheat. So he started up 
    a conversation with him.
    
    <p>(6:11) <i>"There came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak."</i>
    
  <p>(6:12) <i>"And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him, The LORD
    is with thee, thou mighty man of valour."</i>
    
    <p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (6:14-16) And then God joins in the conversation with Gideon and the angel, promising to help Gideon kill all the Midianites.
    
    <p>(6:14) <i>"The LORD ... said ... thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?"</i>

    <p>(6:15) <i>"And he said ... wherewith shall I save Israel?"</i>

    <p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (6:17) <i>"Shew me a sign."</i><br>
    So Gideon has a three-way conversation with the angel and God, but he doesn't believe either of them. He demands a sign.

<tr><td width="57%"><h3>Judges 7</h3>

<td bgcolor="eeeeee" rowspan="26">

<font size="-1">
  <img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (7:2) After God passed all of Gideon's tests, Gideon and God get down to business. First they need an army.
  Luckily, the Israelite slaves maintained a large, well-equiped army. But the army was too big for God's liking. He worried that if they killed all the Midianites with 
  a big army, no one would believe that it was God that did the killing. And God wants all the credit for his killings.
  
  <p>(7:2) <i>"The LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many ... lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me."</i>
  
  <p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (7:3) So God told Gideon to get rid of some of the men. Start with the chicken shits.
 
 <p>(7:3) <i>"Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart ... And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand."</i>
 
 <p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (7:4-5) And that got rid of 22,000. But 10,000 were still there, which was still too many.  But God had a plan.
 
 <p>God told Gideon to have the soldiers go down to the water to get a drink. Those that lap water "as a dog lappeth" are the 
 natural-born killers that he's looking for, while those that get down on their knees to use a cup or their hands should be sent home to mama.
 
<p>(7:4) <i>"The LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water."</i>

<p>(7:5) <i>"So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth,
 him shalt thou set by himself."</i>
 
<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (7:6-9) So Gideon brought them all down to the water to get a drink. Out of the 10,000 non-chicken shits, only 300 lapped water like a dog. These were the few good men 
that God was looking for. Because God knows that <a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2008/05/real-men-pee-standing-up.html">real men pee standing up</a> and lap 
water like dogs.

<p>(7:6) <i>"And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men."</i>
 
 <p>(7:7) <b><i>"The LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you."</i></b>
 
 <p>(7:9) <i>"The LORD said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand."</i>

<p> <IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (7:12) The Midianites and Amalekites had an infinite number of camels -- well, maybe not quite, but at least as many 
       "as the sand by the sea shore." Which is strange since God killed every male Midianite during the time of Moses, and yet here, 250 or so years later, they 
       flourish like grasshoppers "without number." 
       
       <p>(7:12) <i>"And the Midianites and the Amalekites [were] like grasshoppers for
    multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea."</i>
       
    <p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (7:13-14) 
    Was Gideon worried about attacking a gazillion Midianites with an army of 300 water lappers? 
    
    <p>No, because some guy had a dream about barley cakes and tents. The barley cake smote the tents and -- well, anyway, it was a sign from God that he 
    and Gideon would massacre the Midianites.
    
    <p>(7:13) <i>"There was a man that told a dream unto
    his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley
    bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it
    that it fell."</i>
    
    <p>(7:14) <i>"And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of
    Gideon ... into his hand hath God delivered Midian."</i>
    
    <p><img src="../images/abs1.gif">(7:16-20) Gideon gives each dog-lapper a trumpet and a pitcher with a lamp in it. And tells them to blow 
    their trumpets while breaking their pitchers, yelling "The sword of the Lord and of Gideon." So that's what they did.
    
    <p>(7:16) <i>"He divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers."</i>
    
    <p>(7:18) <i>"When I blow with a trumpet ... then blow ye the trumpets ... and say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon."</i>

    <p>(7:19) <i>"They blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that were in their hands."</i>

    <p>(7:20) <i>"And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, 
    and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon."</i>
    
        <p><IMG src="../images/cr1.gif" >
       <IMG src="../images/inj1.gif" > (7:22) When Gideon and his water-lapping companions blow their trumpets, God forces all the enemy soldiers 
to kill each other. <br>

  So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent

  And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the

       son could succeed him. Abimelech came up with a creative solution: he killed 70(?) brothers upon one stone. (He was trying to get in the Guinness Book of World Records.)
       
       <p>But Abimelech's youngest brother got away. So the two remaining sons, Abimelech and Jotham, schemed against each other, striving for control, with Abimelech winning out, becoming king.

<font size="-1">
<img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (12:1) After Jephthah finished burning his daughter for God to pay God back for helping him slaughter twenty Ammonite cities, he ran into some Ephraimites who were 
angry about being left out of the Ammonite slaughter. They were so pissed off about the whole thing that they threatened to burn down Jephthah's house. 

<p>(12:1) <i>"The men of Ephraim ... said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of 
Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire."</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (12:2-4) Jephthah claimed that he invited them to join him in the God-assisted slaughter, but they didn't come. 
Clearly, there was only one thing for Jephthah to do: call for a holy 
civil war. So that's what he did, and the men from Gilead defeated the Epharimites.

<p>(12:2) <i>"Jephthah said ... I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands."</i>

<p>(12:3) <i>"And the LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?"</i>

<p>(12:4) <i>"Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim."</i>

After the battle, Jephthah posted guards at the Jordan River where the fleeing Ephraimites would have to cross. 
When an Ephraimite came to the crossing, the Gileadites would ask him if he was an Ephraimite. If he said, "No", they'd ask him to say "Shibboleth" (Ephraimites couldn't pronounce it correctly. It was like asking George W. Bush or Sarah Palin to 
say "nuclear.") Then when the lying Ephraimite mispronounced Shibboleth by 
saying Siboleth, they'd kill him.

<p>And the shibboleth test worked like a charm. 42,000 Ephraimites failed the test and were killed trying to cross the Jordan.<br>

    <IMG src="../images/wom1.gif"> (13-16) <i>The story of Samson</i><br>
    It starts out in the usual way, with the children of Israel doing evil in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord 
    doing what he always does in such cases: he sells them. (Except that in this case he "delivered" them to the 
    Philistines for forty years, so maybe the Israelites were a gift and he didn't get paid for them.)
    
    <p>(13:1) <i>"The children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years."</i>
    
    <p><IMG src="../images/wom1.gif">
    <IMG src="../images/abs1.gif"> (13:3) After giving, selling, or renting the Israelites to the Philistines, God needed to find someone to help 
    kill the Israelites' new owners. And that's where Sampson comes in.
    
    <p>Sampson's birth was a lot like Jesus'. An angel visited his mom to announce that she was going to have a son.
    
    <p> (13:3) <i>"The angel of the LORD appeared ... and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son."</i>
      Manoah's nameless wife, like so many biblical women, is barren. But an angel (or "a man of God") fixes that, and Samson is born.
    
     <p><img src="../images/interp.gif"> (13:4, 7) <i>"Drink not wine nor strong drink."</i><br>

    <p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (13:5b) <i>"The child shall be a Nazarite from the womb."</i><br>
    According to <a href="../num/6.html#6">Numbers 6:6</a>, Nazarites are not to touch any dead bodies. But Samson was a mass murderer. 
    He must have touched hundreds of dead bodies. (Or did he just kill his victims, being careful not to touch them after they were dead?)

    The impregnating angel had a secret name. (Clarence?, 007?, agent 99?)

    <p> <img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (13:21) <i>"But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife.
    Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD."</i> Manoah and his wife knew the angel was from God because they never saw him again.

<td bgcolor="eeeeee" rowspan="21">

<font size="-1">    
    <IMG src="../images/wom1.gif" >
    <IMG src="../images/sex1.gif" >
    <IMG src="../images/fv.gif" > (14:1-3) <br>The first thing the Bible tells us about Samson is this:    
    
    <p>(14:1) <i>"Samson ... saw a woman ... of the daughters of the Philistines."</i>
    
    <p>(14:3) <i>"And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well."</i>
    
    <p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (14:4) Now Samson's parents were a bit troubled by this, since they knew how crazy God gets 
    when an Israelite even thinks about marrying a non-Israelite. But  they didn't know that Samson's lust for the Philistine woman was "of the Lord." 
    It was all a part of God's plan for killing Philistines.
    
    <p>(14:4) <i>"But his father and his mother knew not that <b>it was of the LORD</b>, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines."</i>    
    
    <p><IMG src="../images/cr1.gif" > 
    <IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (14:5-6) Samson was on his way to visit his new Philistine girlfriend when "the Spirit of the Lord came mightily" 
    upon him, and he ripped up a young lion.
    
    <p>(14:5) <i>"Behold, a young lion roared against him."</i>
    
    <p>(14:6) <i>"And <b>the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, 
    and he rent him as he would have rent a kid."</i></b>
    
   <p><IMG src="../images/wom1.gif" >
    <IMG src="../images/sex1.gif" >
    <IMG src="../images/fv.gif" >
    <img src="../images/abs1.gif">
    <IMG src="../images/sci1.gif" >  (14:7-9)<br> When he arrived at his Philistine girlfriend's place, "she pleased Samson well."
 Then he returned home. On his way he saw the lion carcass, which was covered with bees and filled with honey 
 (a meaningless miracle -- or just rotting flesh and maggots?) and Samson ate some of it. He liked it so much that he took 
     a few handfuls home to feed to his parents. (He didn't tell them where it came from.) 
   
    <p>(14:7) <i>"She pleased Samson well."</i><br>
   
    <p>(14:8) <i>"Behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the  lion."</i>
    
    <p>(14:9) <i>"And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: 
    but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion."</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (14:10-14) The Bible doesn't actaully say so, but I guess Samson married he Philistine 
woman that pleased him well. Then he had a week-long party with thirty of his new-found Philistine friends.

<p>At the party, Samson told a riddle. Whoever can figure it out before the week of partying is over will get 30 sheets and 30 garments. But whoever can't will 
    have to give Samuel 30 sheets and 30 garments. Here's the riddle: "Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness." 

<p>(14:10) <i>"Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do."</i>

<p>(14:11) <i>"They brought thirty companions to be with him."</i>

<p>(14:12) <i>"And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast ... I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments."</i><br>
  
<p>(14:13) <i>"But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments."</i>   

<p>(14:14) <i>"And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness."</i>   

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (14:15-17) Samson's party buddies took the riddle seriously. They tell Samson's new Philistine wife to tell them the answer to the riddle or 
    they'll burn her house down. After crying in front of Samson for seven days, she finally got the answer from Samson, and she told the guys at the party. 
    
<p>(14:15) <i>"Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn
    thee and thy father's house with fire."</i>    
    
<p>(14:17) <i>"She wept before him the seven days ... and ... on the seventh day ... he told her ... and she told the riddle to ... her people."</i>

<p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" >
<IMG src="../images/wom1.gif" >
        <IMG src="../images/sex1.gif" >(14:18) So Samson didn't get his 30 sets of sheets and garments, and he was pissed off about it. 
        He said if they hadn't of "plowed with his heifer" they'd have never found out the riddle. 

<p> (14:18) <i>"If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle."</i>
    
    <p><IMG src="../images/cr1.gif" >
    <IMG src="../images/inj1.gif" > (14:19) <br><b><a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2009/11/gods-51st-killing-samsons-riddle-and.html">The Spirit of the Lord comes upon Samson and he 
    murders 30 men for their clothes</a></b><br>
    Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Samson, and he killed 30 men at random, took their clothes, and gave it to the guys at the 
	party as a prize for guessing his riddle.<br>
	(Samson might have been a decent person if he could have kept the spirit of the Lord off him.)<br>

    and <b>slew thirty men</b> ... and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle."</i> 	

<p><img src="../images/wom1.gif">
<img src="../images/fv.gif"> (14:20) Then after all that, Samson's wife was given to the best man.

<td bgcolor="eeeeee" rowspan="21">

 <font size="-1">
 <img src="../images/abs1.gif">
 <img src="../images/interp.gif"> (15:1) After <a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2009/11/gods-51st-killing-samsons-riddle-and.html">the spirit of the Lord 
 came upon Samson and he murdered 30 men for their clothes</a>, he went to his wife's house for some sex. He even 
 brought a young goat along to pay for her services. [The New Oxford Annotated Bible says that a young goat was "the usual gift for sexual intercourse." 
 (<a href="../gen/38.html#17">Gen.38:17</a>) OK, that may have been true for prostitutes, but did you have to give your wife a goat every time you had sex?]
 
<p>(15:1a) <i>"Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber."</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif">
 <img src="../images/wom1.gif"> 
 <img src="../images/fv.gif"> (15:1b-2) Then Samson's father-in-law had to tell him the bad news: he had given Samson's wife to one of his 
Philistine friends because he thought Samson "hated" her. 
 He suggested that Samson take his younger daughter instead, saying the younger one's prettier anyway. 

<p>(15:1b) <i>"But her father would not suffer him to go in."</i>
 
 <p>(15:2) <i>"And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: 
 is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her."</i>

<p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif">
    <IMG src="../images/inj1.gif">
    <IMG src="../images/cr1.gif"> (15:4-5) But Samson didn't want his wife's little sister. He wanted his wife back, because as you'll recall 
from <a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2009/11/gods-51st-killing-samsons-riddle-and.html">God's last killing</a>, "She pleased Samson well."

So Samson had an idea, an idea that only one of God's special heroes could come up with. He'd catch 300 foxes, tie their tails together, light them on 
fire, and set them loose in the Philistine's grain fields. 

<p>(15:4) <b> <i>"Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails."</i></b>

</b>

<p>(15:5) <b> <i>"And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go</b> into the standing corn of the Philistines."</i>

</b>

<p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif"> (15:6) But it didn't work out as planned. After the burning foxes destroyed the fields, the 
Philistines didn't 
give Samson his wife back; they burned her 
and her father to death. 

<p>(15:6) <i>"Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson ... 
because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire."</i>

<p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif">
    <IMG src="../images/inj1.gif">
    <IMG src="../images/cr1.gif"> (15:7-8) In response, Samson smote the 
Philistines "hip and thigh" wit a great slaughter. (I'm not including this killing on God's list, since the Bible 
doesn't tell us that "the Spirit of the Lord cam upon him" or otherwise imply that God was involved.)

<p>(15:7) <i>"Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease."</i>

<p>(15:8) <i>"And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter."</i>

<p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif">
    <IMG src="../images/cr1.gif"> (15:11-16) <b><a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2009/11/gods-52nd-killing-samson-kills-1000.html">The Spirit of the Lord 
    came upon Samson and he killed 1000 men with the jawbone of an ass.</a></b> <br>
    Then 3000 men of Judah came, tied him up, and took him to the Philistines. When they delivered Samson "the Spirit of the Lord came upon him" and he broke the ropes 
    and killed 1000 men with the jawbone of an ass.<br>

<p>(15:11-12) <i>"Three thousand men of Judah ... said to Samson ... We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines."</i>

<p>(15:13) <i>"And they bound him with two new cords."</i>

<p>(15:14) <b><i>"The spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him,"</i></b>

<p>(15:15) <b><i>"And he found a new jawbone of an ass and slew a thousand men therewith."</i></b>

<p>(15:16) <i>"And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men."</i>

<p> <img src="../images/abs1.gif" >(15:17-19) After Samson killed 1000 men with the jawbone of an ass, he was thirsty. So God 
    created and filled a hollow in the very same jawbone and put water in it for Samson to drink.
    
    <p>(15:17) <i>"When he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand."</i>
    
    <p>(15:18) <i>"And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD,"</i>
    
<p>(15:19) <i>"God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water thereout."</i><br>

   he had sex with a prostitute.
   
   <p>(16:1) <b><i>"Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her."</i></b>
       
<p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (16:3) At midnight, he left the prostitute and ripped out the doors and gate posts of the city and carried them to the top of a hill.

<p>(16:3) <i>"Samson ... took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them."</i>
     
<p><IMG src="../images/sex1.gif" >
   <IMG src="../images/fv.gif" > (16:4) Then Samson saw and fell in love with Delilah.
   
   <p>(16:4) <i>"Afterward ... he loved a woman ... whose name was Delilah."</i>
   
   <p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (16:6) Delilah was paid by the Philistines to find the magical source of Samson's strength and to figure out how he could be restrained. 
   So she asked Samson three times about it, while some Philistines hid in another room.
   
   <p>(16:6) <i>"Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound."</i>

 <p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (16:7-9) The first time he said that he'd become as week as any other man if he were tied up with bowstrings. So she did that and 
    then shouted, "Hey Samson, the Philistines are coming!" But he broke the bowstrings as though they were burnt strings.   
   
   <p>(16:7) <i>"Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man."</i>
   
   <p>(16:8) <i>"The Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them."</i>
   
   <p>(16:9) <i>"And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire."</i>
   
   <p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (16:10-12) She asked again and he told her to use ropes. So she tied him with ropes 
   and then shouted, "Hey Samson, the Philistines are coming!" But he broke the ropes like they were threads.
   
   <p>(16:10) <i>"Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound."</i>
   
   <p>(16:11) <i>"And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man."</i>

   <p>(16:12) <i>"Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson ... And he brake them from off his arms like a thread."</i>
  
   <p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (16:13-14) She asked him a third time, and he told her to weave his seven braids into a cloth and fasten the whole mess to the wall. 
    So she did that and then shouted, "Hey Samson (you dumb shit), the Philistines are coming!" But he broke out of that one, too.
    
    <p>(16:13) <i>"Delilah said unto Samson ... tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web."</i>
    
    <p>(16:14) <i>"And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he ... went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web."</i>

    <p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (16:16-17) But Delilah didn't give up. She kept pestering him until finally Samson told her the true source of his strength. 
    It was his hair. If his hair was shaved off, he'd become as weak as any other man.
    
    <p>(16:16-17) <i>"When she pressed him daily ... he told her ... There hath not come a razor upon mine head ... if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me,
     and I shall become weak, and be like any other man."</i>
     
     <p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (16:19-20) <br>So when Samson fell asleep on her lap, she cut his hair. 
     
    <p>(16:19) <i>"She made him sleep upon her knees ... to shave off the seven locks of his head ... and his strength went from him."</i>
    
    <p>(16:20) <i>"And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him."</i>
 
<p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (16:21) Then the Philistines captured Samson, gouged out his eyes, 
    and put him in prison. 
    
    <p>(16:21) <i>"The Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house."</i>

     Later, at one of their big parties, the Philistines brought Samson out to entertain them. Then Samson, with God's help, killed himself
and 3000 Philistine men and women by causing a roof to collapse. This was the first suicide terrorist attack. God approved of of it and gave Samson the strength to do it. And although 
the Bible doesn't say so, there are unconfirmed reports that Samson shouted "God is great (Allahu Akbar)" as the walss came tumbling down.<br>

The story begins with the tribe of Dan (one of the 12 tribes of Israel) looking for a nice place to live. So they sent out five men to find some land.

<p>(18:1) <i>"The Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in."</i>

<p>(18:2) <i>"And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts ... to spy out the land, and to search it."</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (18:3-6) On their way, they stopped at a Micah's house and asked his priest to ask God where they should go to find some land. The priest 
told them to just go looking for it, and that God would be with them wherever they went.

<p>(18:3) <i>"When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither."</i>

<p>(18:4) <i>"He said unto them ... Micah ... hath hired me, and I am his priest."</i>

<p>(18:5) <i>"They said unto him, Ask counsel ... of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous."</i>

<p><img src="../images/interp.gif"> (18:6) <i>"The LORD is your way wherein ye go."</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (18:7) So they left there and came to a place called Laish, where the people lived peaceful, secure, carefree lives.
</b>

<p>(18:7) <i>"The five men ... came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt careless, ... 
quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing."</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (18:8-10) Then the five men returned and told the other Danites to attack Laish, saying that God had given it into their hands.

<p>(18:8) <i>"They came unto their brethren ... and their brethren said unto them, What say ye?"</i>

<p>(18:9) <i>"And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good ... go, and ... possess the land."</i>

<p><img src="../images/interp.gif"> (18:10) <i>"When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large land: for <b>God hath given 
it into your hands</b>; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth."</i>

<p><img src="../images/abs1.gif"> (18:11) So the Danites round up 600 soldiers and march off toward Laish.

<p>(18:11) <i>"There went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war."</i>

<font size="-1">

<IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (20:1-48) <b><a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2009/12/gods-54th-killing-god-smites-benjamites.html">A Holy Civil War</a></b><br>
     After receiving the Levite's rotting concubine body part message (see <a href="19.html">the last chapter</a> for the gory details), the entire population of 
     Israel along with 400,000 soldiers gathered together to decide what to do about it. 
     
<p>(20:1) <i>"The children of Israel ... gathered together as one man ...  unto the LORD in Mizpeh."</i>

<p>(20:2) <i>"All the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword."</i>

<p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (20:3-6) When they arrived at Mizpeh, the Israelites asked the meaning of the rotting flesh messages. So the Levite told them the nasty story that 
is found in <a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/jg/19.html#22">Judges 19</a>, except that he left out the part about 
how <a href="19.html#25">he gave his concubine to the mob to do with as they pleased</a>. 

<p>(20:3) <i>"Then said the children of Israel, Tell us, how was this wickedness?"</i>

<p>(20:4) <i>"The Levite ... said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge."</i>

<p>(20:5) <i>"And the men of Gibeah rose against me ... and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead."</i>

<p>(20:6) <i>"And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country."</i>

<p><IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (20:8-9) When the Israelites heard this, they all said together in complete unison.

<p>(20:8) <i>"And all the people arose as one man, saying,"</i>

<p>(20:9) <i>"This shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we will go up by lot against it."</i>

<p>(God's just war theory: Since the town of Gibeah was where the incident with the concubine occurred, and the inhabitants of Gibeah
 were from the tribe of Benjamin, the other Israelite tribes must go to war with the Benjamites. This may not make much sense to you, 
 but it does to God.)
 
<p><IMG src="../images/cr1.gif" >
<IMG src="../images/inj1.gif" >
<IMG src="../images/abs1.gif" > (20:12-21) The Benjamites refuse to turn over the men from Gibeah (the town that wanted to have sex with the Levite but settled for 
     his concubine instead), so the Israelites asked God which tribe should go to war with them. God said the tribe of Judah 
     should go first. Judah goes to war and the Benjamites, with their 700 sharp shooting lefties, kill 22,000 Israelites.
     
     <p>(20:12) <i>"The tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?"</i>
     
     <p>(20:13) <i>"Deliver us the men ... which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death ... But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel."</i>

<p>(20:16) <i>"There were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth, 
     and not miss."</i>
     
<p>(20:18) <i>"The children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle 
against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said, Judah shall go up first."</i>

    After the Israelites heard the Levite's story (about chopping up his dead concubine and 
    sending her body parts to each tribe of Israel) they vowed not to "give" their daughters to the Benjamites. So now they had a problem: 
    they just finished killing all the Benjamite women and children (<a href="20.html#48">Jg 20:48</a>) so there were no women for the surviving Benjamite men to marry. 
    [There were 600 Benjamite men that survived the war with the Israelites. (<a href="20.html#47">Jg 20:47</a>)]
    
    <p>(21:1) <i>"The men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife."</i>
    
    <p>(21:7) <i>"How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD 
    that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?"</i>
    
 <p><img src="../images/abs1.gif">
     <img src="../images/inj1.gif"> (21:8-11) But they find a great solution. They check their records and find that no one from Jabeshgilead came to the rotting-concubine-
    body-part meeting. So they go and kill everyone in Jabeshgilead except for the virgin women and give them to the 600 surviving Benjamites.
    
    <p>(21:8) <i>"What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up
    to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came none to the camp from
    Jabeshgilead."</i>
    
    <p>(21:10) <i>"And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, 
    and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children."</i>
    
      <p>(21:11) <i>"Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man."</i>

     So the Israelites killed all the non-virgin women and children in Jabeshgilead, bringing back 400 virgin women to give to the 
     Benjamites. But they were still 200 short. Damn!   <br>

      So they come up with another brilliant plan. Have the Benjamites hide in the bushes and then catch the daughters of Shiloh when they 
      come out to dance. So that's what they did and everyone lived happily ever after.<br>
