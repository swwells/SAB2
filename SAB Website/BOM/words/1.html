	<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (1-2) <i>"And now I, Mormon, being about to deliver up the record
 which I have been making into the hands of my son Moroni ... many hundred years after the coming of Christ."</i><br>
	"Words of Mormon" was engraved on golden plates by a Mormon prophet named Mormon 
	(<a href="../mormon/1.html#5">whose father was also named Mormon</a>)
	<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/w-of-m/1?lang=eng">about 
	385 CE</a>. Mormon Jr. entrusted the golden plates to his son Moroni, who buried them on a hill in what would later become Wayne County, New 
	York. 1400 years later, after being resurrected as an angel, Moroni delivered the 
	golden plates to Joseph Smith.
	
	<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (3-11) Mormon finds and abridges the plates of Nephi, which were written over a period of about 1000 years. 
	He wrote down less than one percent of all the stuff that was written, for which we should all be grateful. What he wrote he thinks is 
	choice; he wrote it while the spirit of the Lord whispered to him. And he knows it will be preserved because it's such great stuff. 	

	<p>(3) <i>"I speak somewhat concerning that which I have written; for after I had made an abridgment from the plates of Nephi ... 
I found these plates."</i>
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="1">1</a></b> <span class="a">And now I, Mormon, being about to deliver up the record
 which I have been making into the hands of my son Moroni</span>, behold I have witnessed almost all the destruction 
 of my people, the Nephites. 

<tr><td><b><a name="2">2</a></b>   And it is<span class="a"> many hundred years after the coming of Christ</span> that I deliver these records into the hands of 
my son; and it supposeth me that he will witness the entire destruction of my people.  But may God grant that he may 
survive them, that he may write somewhat concerning them, and somewhat concerning Christ, that perhaps some day it may 
profit them. 

<tr><td><b><a name="3">3</a></b>   And now, <span class="a">I speak somewhat concerning that which I have written; for after 
I had made an abridgment from 
the plates of Nephi</span>, down to the reign of this king Benjamin, of whom Amaleki spake, I searched among the records 
which had been delivered into my hands, and <span class="a">I found these plates</span>, which contained this small account 
of the prophets, from Jacob down to the reign of this king Benjamin, and also many of the words of Nephi. 

<tr><td><b><a name="4">4</a></b>   And the things which are upon these plates pleasing me, because of the prophecies of the coming of 
Christ; and my fathers knowing that many of them have been fulfilled; yea, and I also know that as many things as have 
been prophesied concerning us down to this day have been fulfilled, and as many as go beyond this day must surely come 
to pass --  <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5">5</a></b>   Wherefore, I chose these things, to finish my record upon them, which remainder of my record I shall 
take from the plates of Nephi; and <span class="a">I cannot write the hundredth part of the things of my people.

 with the remainder of my record, <span class="a">for they are choice unto me; and I know they will be choice unto my brethren.
