<p><li>Christians are washed in the blood of Jesus. <a href="1.html#7">1:7</a>

<p><li>John thinks he is living in "the last times." He "knows" this because he sees so many antichrists around.
 <a href="2.html#18">2:18</a>
 
 <p><li>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us."<br>
 Many Christians interpret this verse to mean that it is impossible for a true believer to become an unbeliever. (They become 
 antichrists instead.) <a href="2.html#19">2:19</a>
 
<p><li>Whoever denies "that Jesus is the Christ" is a liar and an antichrist. If so, then there are about five billion
antichrists now living. <a href="2.html#22">2:22</a>

<p><li>John says that whoever sins is "of the devil." But if what he said in <A href="1.html#8">1:8</A>, <A
href="1.html#10">10</A> is true, then everyone is &quot;of the devil.&quot; <a href="3.html#8">3:8</a>

<p><li>How's this for a big lie? "Whatsoever we ask, we receive of him." <a href="3.html#22">3:22</a>

<p><li>John says that all spirits that say Jesus is the Christ are of God. If so, then the "unclean spirits" in Mark's gospel
(<a href="../mk/1.html#23">1:23-24</a>, <a href="../mk/3.html#11">3:11</a>, <a href="../mk/5.html#7">5:7</a>) must have 
been of God. <a href="4.html#2">4:2, 15</a>, <a href="5.html#1">5:1</a>

<p><li>John says that the antichrist was already present at the time 1 John was written. So Pat Robertson must be wrong
when he says the antichrist is a Jewish man that is alive today. <a href="4.html#3">4:3</a>

<p><li>You're not living unless you've got Jesus. <a href="5.html#12">5:12</a>

<p><li>"There is a sin unto death." (But nobody knows what it is.) <a href="5.html#16">5:16</a>

<p><li>Christians are "of God;" everyone else is wicked. <a href="5.html#19">5:19</a>
