<tr><td><b><a name="1">4:1</a></b>   And now, I, Nephi, speak concerning the prophecies of which my father hath spoken, concerning Joseph, who 
was carried into Egypt.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 

<tr><td><b><a name="2">4:2</a></b>   For behold, he truly prophesied concerning all his seed.  And the prophecies which he wrote, there are 
not many greater.  And he prophesied concerning us, and our future generations; and they are written upon the plates of 
brass. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3">4:3</a></b>   Wherefore, after my father had made an end of speaking concerning the prophecies of Joseph, he called 
the children of Laman, his sons, and his daughters, and said unto them: Behold, my sons, and my daughters, who are the 
sons and the daughters of my first-born, I would that ye should give ear unto my words. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4">4:4</a></b>   For the Lord God hath said that: Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land; 
and inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5">4:5</a></b>   But behold, my sons and my daughters, I cannot go down to my grave save I should leave a blessing upon 
you; for behold, I know that if ye are brought up in the way ye should go ye will not depart from it. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6">4:6</a></b>   Wherefore, if ye are cursed, behold, I leave my blessing upon you, that the cursing may be taken from 
you and be answered upon the heads of your parents. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7">4:7</a></b>   Wherefore, because of my blessing the Lord God will not suffer that ye shall perish; wherefore, he will 
be merciful unto you and unto your seed forever. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8">4:8</a></b>   And <span class="a">It came to pass</span> that after my father had made an end of speaking to the sons

my second son; behold I leave unto you the same blessing which I left unto the sons and daughters of Laman; wherefore, 
thou shalt not utterly be destroyed; but in the end thy seed shall be blessed. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10">4:10</a></b>   And <span class="a">It came to pass</span> that when my father had made an end of speaking unto them, 
behold, he spake unto the sons of Ishmael, yea, and even all his household. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11">4:11</a></b>   And after he had made 
an end of speaking unto them, he spake unto Sam, saying: Blessed art thou, and thy seed; for thou shall inherit the land 
like unto thy brother Nephi.  And thy seed shall be numbered with his seed; and thou shalt be even like unto thy brother, 
and thy seed like unto his seed; and thou shalt be blessed in all thy days. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

sons of Ishmael were angry with me because of the admonitions of the Lord. 

<tr><td><b><a name="14">4:14</a></b>   For I, Nephi, was constrained to speak unto them, according to his word; for I had spoken many things 
unto them, and also my father, before his death; many of which sayings are written upon mine other plates; for a more 
history part are written upon mine other plates. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15">4:15</a></b>   And upon these I write the things of my soul, and many of the scriptures which are engraven upon the 
plates of brass.  For my soul delighteth in the scriptures, and my heart pondereth them, and writeth them for the 
learning and the profit of my children. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16">4:16</a></b>   Behold, my soul delighteth in the things of the Lord; and my heart pondereth continually upon the 
things which I have seen and heard. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17">4:17</a></b>   Nevertheless, notwithstanding the great goodness of the Lord, in showing me his great and marvelous 
works, my heart exclaimeth: <span class="plag">O wretched man that I am!</span>  Yea, my heart sorroweth because of my flesh; my soul grieveth 
because of mine iniquities. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

have trusted. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20">4:20</a></b>   My God hath been my support; he hath led me through mine afflictions in the wilderness; and he hath

<tr><td><b><a name="24">4:24</a></b>   And by day have I waxed bold in mighty prayer before him; yea, my voice have I sent up on high; and

should not write them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26">4:26</a></b>   O then, if I have seen so great things, if the Lord in his condescension unto the children of men 
hath visited men in so much mercy, why should my heart weep and my soul linger in the valley of sorrow, and my flesh 
waste away, and my strength slacken, because of mine afflictions? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="27">4:27</a></b>   And why should I yield to sin, because of my flesh?  Yea, why should I give way to temptations, that 
the evil one have place in my heart to destroy my peace and afflict my soul?  Why am I angry because of mine enemy? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="28">4:28</a></b>   Awake, my soul!  No longer droop in sin.  Rejoice, O my heart, and give place no more for the enemy of 
my soul. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="29">4:29</a></b>   Do not anger again because of mine enemies.  Do not slacken my strength because of mine 
afflictions. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

make me that I may shake at the appearance of sin? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="32">4:32</a></b>   May the gates of hell be shut continually before me, because that my heart is broken and my spirit is 
contrite!  O Lord, wilt thou not shut the gates of thy righteousness before me, that I may walk in the path of the low 
valley, that I may be strict in the plain road! <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="33">4:33</a></b>   O Lord, wilt thou encircle me around in the robe of thy righteousness!  O Lord, wilt thou make a way for 
mine escape before mine enemies!  Wilt thou make my path straight before me!   Wilt thou not place a stumbling block in 
my way -- but that thou wouldst clear my way before me, and hedge not up my way, but the ways of mine enemy. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="34">4:34</a></b>   O Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will trust in thee forever.  I will not put my trust in the arm of 
flesh; for I know that cursed is he that putteth his trust in the arm of flesh.   Yea, cursed is he that putteth his 
trust in man or maketh flesh his arm. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="35">4:35</a></b>   Yea, I know that God will give liberally to him that asketh.   Yea, my God will give me, if I ask not 
amiss; therefore I will lift up my voice unto thee; yea, I will cry unto thee, my God, the rock of my righteousness.  
Behold, my voice shall forever ascend up unto thee, my rock and mine everlasting God.  Amen. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
