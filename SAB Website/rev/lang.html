<p><li>False Jews are members of "the synagogue of Satan." <a href="2.html#9">2:9</a>

<p><li>Jezebel (whom God had thrown off a wall, trampled by horses, and eaten by dogs 
(<a href="../2kg/9.html#33">2 Kg 9:33-37</a>) is further
reviled by John, saying "that woman Jezebel" taught and seduced God's "servants to commit fornication." 
<a href="2.html#20">2:20</a>

<p><li>Jesus will "cast her [Jezebel] into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her." <a href="2.html#22">2:22</a>

<p><li>God will make "the synagogue of Satan" [the Jews] "come and worship before thy feet." (Whose
feet? Well, the feet of Christians, of course!) <a href="3.html#9">3:9</a>

<p><li>Drinking the wine of fornication. <a href="14.html#8">14:8</a>

<p><li> The great whore has &quot;committed fornication&quot; with all the kings on earth. 
Everyone else is &quot;drunk with the wine of her fornication.&quot; She sits on a scarlet 
colored beast with the usual 7 heads and 10 horns. She carries a cup full of the 
&quot;filthiness of her abominations&quot; and has a big sign on her forehead saying: 
&quot;Mystery, Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the 
Earth.&quot; You'll know her when you see her. <a href="17.html#1">17:1-5</a>

<p><li>"And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the
    blood of the martyrs." <a href="17.html#6">17:6</a>
    
<p><li>"All nations have  drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the
    earth have committed fornication with her." <a href="18.html#3">18:3</a>
    
<p><li>God will send plagues, death, and famine on Babylon, and the kings "who have committed 
fornication with her" will be sad to see her burn. <a href="18.html#8">18:8-9</a>

<p><li>The "great whore" corrupted the earth with her fornication. <a href="19.html#2">19:2</a>

<p><li>"Come ... unto the supper of the great God." An angel calls all the fowls to feast
upon the flesh of dead horses and human bodies, "both free and bond, both small and great." 
 <a href="19.html#17">19:17-18</a>
 
<p><li>I'm not sure who the
&quot;dogs&quot; are in this verse. (Some say they are homosexuals.) But whoever 
they are, John&nbsp; condemns them all to hell. <a href="22.html#15">22:15</a>
