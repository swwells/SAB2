<p><li>"Let her say unto the Egyptians, she is thy sister, and thy soul shall live."</i><br>
God tells Abraham to ask Sarai to lie to the Egyptians. I guess it's okay to lie. (If it wasn't, God wouldn't have recommended it to Abraham.)
<a href="2.html#22">2:22-25</a>

<p><li>Notice that in <a href="../../gen/12.html#13">the Genesis story</a> it is Abraham, not God, that makes up the lie.  <a href="2.html#22">2:22-25</a>

<p><li>"And they, that is the Gods, organized and formed the heavens and the earth."</i><br>
Although <a href="../../contra/gods.html">the Bible is ambiguous on the subject</a>, the Book of Abraham makes it very clear: there are many 
gods. Mormonism is a polytheistic faith. <a href="4.html#1">4:1-31</a>
