<p><li>First appearance of the word "Christ" in the modern BoM. "Christ" appeared earlier (<a href=
../1ne/12.html#18">1 Nephi 12:18</a>) in <a href="http://www.helpingmormons.org/18302neph.htm">the 1
830 edition</a>, but was changed to "Messiah" to avoid contradicting this verse. <a href="10.html#3">10:3</a>

<p><li>1830: seraphims
<br>Now: seraphim <br>
The 1830 edition copied the KJV error in the plural of seraph. <a href="16.html#2">16:2, 6</a>

<p><li>1830: Wo me!
<br>Now: Wo is unto me! <a href="16.html#5">16:5</a>
<br>The omitted italicized word "is" was later corrected.

<p><li>1830: Here I; send me.
<br>Now: Here I am; send me. <a href="16.html#8">16:8</a>
<br>The omitted italicized word "am" was later corrected.

<p><li>1830: ...they shall be a <i>white</i> and delightsome people...
<br>Now: ...they shall be a <i>pure</i> and delightsome people.... <a href="30.html#6">30:6</a>
<br>"White" was changed to "delightsome" to try to soften the obvious racism of this prophecy.
