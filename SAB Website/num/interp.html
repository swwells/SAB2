<p><li>When "Moses numbered them according to the word of the Lord" he was told to count "every 
male from a month old and upward." Women and girls didn't count as persons. Neither did babies 
(or fetuses) under 1 month old. I guess the unborn just don't count to God.  <a href="3.html#15">3:15-16</a>

<p><li> Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, the first freethought/democracy martyrs, refused to follow Moses blindly, saying 
        that everyone is holy and should be free to think for him or herself. God killed them and their 
        families for daring to challenge Moses. <a href="16.html#1">16:1-35</a>
