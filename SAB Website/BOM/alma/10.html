"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",
"<span class='i'>Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever.</span>--<a href='3.html#14'>Alma 3:14</a>",
"<span class='i'>I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</span>--<a href='3.html#15'>Alma 3:15</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",
"<span class='a'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges ... even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year....</span>--<a href='16.html#1'>Alma 16:1</a>",
"<span class='a'>Their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.</span>--<a href='16.html#11'>Alma 16:11</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.   Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</span>--<a href='30.html#22'>Alma 30:22</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",

"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",

"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",
"<span class='i'>These dissenters ... became ... more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='47.html#36'>Alma 47:36</a>",
"<span class='a'>God would prosper them in the land, or in other words ... God ... would prosper them in the land.</span>--<a href='48.html#15'>Alma 48:15</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='50.html#22'>Alma 50:22</a>",
"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",
"<span class='i'>The remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty.</span>--<a href='51.html#20'>Alma 51:20</a>",
"<span class='g'>And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye.</span>--<a href='54.html#21'>Alma 54:21</a>",

<tr><td width="60%"><h3>Alma 10</h3>
<td bgcolor="eeeeee">


<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>10:1</b>   Now these are the words which Amulek preached unto the people who were in the land of Ammonihah, 
saying: <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>10:2</b>   I am Amulek; I am the son of Giddonah, who was the son of Ishmael, who was a descendant of 
Aminadi; and <span class="a">it was the same Aminadi who interpreted the writing which was upon the wall of the temple, which was 
written by the finger of God.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1">Aminadi interpreted the writing on the wall that was written by the finger of God. (Just like 
Daniel supposedly did in <a href="../../dan/5.html#5">Dan.5:5-28</a>.)</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>10:3</b>   And Aminadi was a descendant of Nephi, who was the son of Lehi, who came out of the land of 
Jerusalem, who was a descendant of Manasseh, who was the son of Joseph who was sold into Egypt by the hands of his 
brethren. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>10:4</b>   And behold, I am also a man of no small reputation among all those who know me; yea, and 
behold, I have many kindreds and friends, and I have also acquired much riches by the hand of my industry. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>10:5</b>   Nevertheless, after all this, <span class="c">I never have known much of the ways of the Lord, and his 
mysteries and marvelous power.  I said I never had known much of these things; but behold, I mistake, for I have 
seen much of his mysteries and his marvelous power;</span> yea, even in the preservation of the lives of this people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">

<i>"I said I never had known much of these things; but behold, I mistake."</i><br>
<a href="../contra/true.html">Is the Book of Mormon true?</a>
</font>


<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>10:6</b>   Nevertheless, I did harden my heart, for I was called many times and I would not hear; 
therefore I knew concerning these things, yet I would not know; therefore I went on rebelling against God, in the 
wickedness of my heart, even until the fourth day of this seventh month, which is in the tenth year of the reign of 
the judges. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>10:7</b>   As I was journeying to see a very near kindred, behold an angel of the Lord appeared unto 
me and said: Amulek, return to thine own house, for thou shalt feed a prophet of the Lord; yea, a holy man, who is 
a chosen man of God; for he has fasted many days because of the sins of this people, and he is an hungered, and 
thou shalt receive him into thy house and feed him, and he shall bless thee and thy house; and the blessing of the 
Lord shall rest upon thee and thy house. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>10:8</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that I obeyed the voice of the angel, and 
returned towards my house.  And as I was going thither I found the man whom the angel said unto me: Thou shalt 
receive into thy house -- and behold it was this same man who has been speaking unto you concerning the things of
 God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a><br> (10:8, 16, 17, 24, 28, 30)
</font>
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>10:9</b>   And the angel said unto me he is a holy man; wherefore I know he is a holy man because 
 it was said by an angel of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>10:10</b>   And again, I know that the things whereof he hath testified are true; for behold I say 
 unto you, that as the Lord liveth, even so has he sent his angel to make these things manifest unto me; and this he 
 has done while this Alma hath dwelt at my house. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>10:11</b>   For behold, he hath blessed mine house, he hath blessed me, and my women, and my children, 
 and my father and my kinsfolk; yea, even all my kindred hath he blessed, and the blessing of the Lord hath rested 
 upon us according to the words which he spake. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>10:12</b>   And now, when Amulek had spoken these words the people began to be astonished, seeing 
 there was more than one witness who testified of the things whereof they were accused, and also of the things 
 which were to come, according to the spirit of prophecy which was in them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>10:13</b>   Nevertheless, there were some among them who thought to question them, that by their 
 cunning devices they might catch them in their words, that they might find witness against them, that they might 
 deliver them to their judges that they might be judged according to the law, and that they might be slain or cast 
 into prison, according to the crime which they could make appear or witness against them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>10:14</b>   Now it was those men who sought to destroy them, who were lawyers, who were hired or 
 appointed by the people to administer the law at their times of trials, or at the trials of the crimes of the 
 people before the judges. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>10:15</b>   Now these lawyers were learned in all the arts and cunning of the people; and this was 
 to enable them that they might be skilful in their profession. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>10:16</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they began to question Amulek, that 
 thereby they might make him cross his words, or contradict the words which he should speak. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>10:17</b>   Now they knew not that Amulek could know of their designs.   <span class="a">But 
 it came to pass</span> as they 
 began to question him, he perceived their thoughts, and he said unto them: <span class="c">O ye wicked and perverse 
 generation</span>, ye 
 lawyers and hypocrites, for ye are laying the foundation of the devil; for ye are laying traps and snares to catch 
 the holy ones of God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/plag.gif" border="0" width="32" height="32">
O faithless and perverse generation -- <a href="../../mt/17.html#17">Matthew 17:17</a></font>
  
 <tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>10:18</b>   Ye are laying plans to pervert the ways of the righteous, and to bring down the wrath of 
 God upon your heads, even to the utter destruction of this people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>10:19</b>   Yea, well did Mosiah say, who was our last king, when he was about to deliver up 
 the kingdom, having no one to confer it upon, causing that this people should be governed by their own voices -- 
 yea, well did he say that if the time should come that the voice of this people should choose iniquity, that is, 
 if the time should come that this people should fall into transgression, they would be ripe for destruction. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>10:20</b>   And now I say unto you that well doth the Lord judge of your iniquities; well doth he cry 
 unto this people, by the voice of his angels: <span class="c">Repent ye, repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/plag.gif" border="0" width="32" height="32"><font size="-1">
Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. -- <a href="../../mt/4.html#17">Matthew 4:17</a></font>
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>10:21</b>   Yea, well doth he cry, by the voice of his angels that: I will come down among my people, 
 with equity and justice in my hands. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>10:22</b>   Yea, and I say unto you that if it were not for the prayers of the righteous, who are 
 now in the land, that ye would even now be visited with utter destruction; yet it would not be by flood, as were 
 the people in the days of Noah, but it would be by famine, and by pestilence, and the sword. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>10:23</b>   But it is by the prayers of the righteous that ye are spared; now therefore, if ye will cast 
 out the righteous from among you then will not the Lord stay his hand; but in his fierce anger he will come out 
 against you; then ye shall be smitten by famine, and by pestilence, and by the sword; and the time is soon at 
 hand except ye repent. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>10:24</b>   <span class="a">And now it came to pass</span> that the people were more angry with Amulek, and they cried 
 out, saying: This man doth revile against our laws which are just, and our wise lawyers whom we have selected. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>10:25</b>   But Amulek stretched forth his hand, and cried the mightier unto them, saying: 
 <span class="c">O ye wicked 
 and perverse generation</span>, why hath Satan got such great hold upon your hearts?  Why will ye yield yourselves unto him 
 that he may have power over you, to blind your eyes, that ye will not understand the words which are spoken, 
 according to their truth? <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/plag.gif" border="0" width="32" height="32"><font size="-1">
O faithless and perverse generation -- <a href="../../mt/17.html#17">Matthew 17:17</a></font>
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>10:26</b>   For behold, have I testified against your law?  Ye do not understand; ye say that I have 
 spoken against your law; but I have not, but I have spoken in favor of your law, to your condemnation. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>10:27</b>   And now behold, I say unto you, that the foundation of the destruction of this people is 
 beginning to be laid by the unrighteousness of your lawyers and your judges. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>10:28</b>   <span class="a">And now it came to pass</span> that when Amulek had spoken these words the people cried out 
 against him, saying: Now we know that this man is a child of the devil, for he hath lied unto us; for he hath spoken 
 against our law.  And now he says that he has not spoken against it. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>10:29</b>   And again, he has reviled against our lawyers, and our judges. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>10:30</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the lawyers put it into their hearts that 
 they should remember these things against him. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="31"></a>10:31</b>   And there was one among them whose name was Zeezrom.  Now he was the foremost to accuse 
 Amulek and Alma, he being one of the most expert among them, having much business to do among the people. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
 
 <tr><td><b><a name="32"></a>10:32</b>   Now the object of these lawyers was to get gain; and they got gain according to their 
 employ. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
