<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" >
<img src="../../images/sci1.gif" > (1) <i>"My father ... taught me in his language."</i><br>
Enos' father (Jacob) taught him in his language -- which, of course, was reformed Egyptian. (All native Americans spoke reformed Egyptian in 500 BCE.)

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif" > (1) in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. <a href="../../eph/6.html#4">Ephesians 6:4</a>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (5-18) Enos has a long conversation with a voice in his head that he believes to be God, who tells him 
that he is forgiven through his faith in Jesus, who wouldn't be born for another 500 years. And whatever he asks "in the name of Christ," he will receive. 
God also "covenanted" with Enos, saying he'd preserve his plates with the Lamanites.

<p>(5) <i>"And there came a voice unto me, saying: Enos, thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed."</i>

<p>(7) <i>"And I said: Lord, how is it done?"</i>

many years pass away before he shall manifest himself in the flesh."</i>

</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>1</b>   Behold, <span class="a">it came to pass</span> that I, Enos, knowing <span class="a">my father</span> that he 
was a just man -- for he <span class="a">taught me in his language</span>, and also <span class="plag">in the nurture and admonition of the 
Lord</span> -- and blessed be the name of my God for it --  

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>2</b> And I will tell you of the wrestle which I had before God, before I received a remission 
of my sins. 

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>3</b>   Behold, I went to hunt beasts in the forests; and the words which I had often heard my father speak 
concerning eternal life, and the joy of the saints, sunk deep into my heart. 

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>4</b>   And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and 
supplication for mine own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night came I did still raise 
my voice high that it reached the heavens. 

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>5</b>   <span class="a">And there came a voice unto me, saying: Enos, thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>6</b>   And I, Enos, knew that God could not lie; wherefore, my guilt was swept away. 

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>7</b>   <span class="a">And I said: Lord, how is it done? </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>8</b> <span class="a">And he said unto me: Because of thy faith in Christ, whom thou hast never before heard nor seen.  And 
many years pass away before he shall manifest himself in the flesh;</span> wherefore, go to, <span class="plag">thy faith hath made 
thee whole.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>9</b>   Now, <span class="a">it came to pass</span> that when I had heard these words I began to feel a desire for the welfare of my 
brethren, the Nephites; wherefore, I did pour out my whole soul unto God for them.<td bgcolor="eeeeee"> 

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>10</b>   And while I was thus struggling in the spirit,<span class="a"> behold, the voice of the Lord came into my mind again, 
saying: I will visit thy brethren according to their diligence in keeping my commandments.  I have given unto them this 
land, and it is a holy land; and I curse it not save it be for the cause of iniquity; wherefore, I will visit thy 
brethren according as I have said; and their transgressions will I bring down with sorrow upon their own heads.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

(10) <i>"Behold, the voice of the Lord came into my mind again, saying: I will visit thy brethren according to their diligence in keeping my commandments. 
I have given unto them this land, and it is a holy land; and I curse it not save it be for the cause of iniquity; wherefore, I will visit thy brethren 
according as I have said; and their transgressions will I bring down with sorrow upon their own heads."</i>

	</font> 

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>11</b>   And after I, Enos, had heard these words, my faith began to be unshaken in the Lord; and I prayed unto 
him with many long strugglings for my brethren, the Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>12</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that after I had prayed and labored with all diligence,

The Lamanites (Native Americans) were wild, ferocious, bloodthirsty, and filthy."

A Cimeter (or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scimitar">scimitar</a>) is a curved sword with the sharp edge on the convex side. This type of sword did not exist at 
the time Enos was supposedly written (ca. 500 BCE). Indeed there is no evidence that swords of any kind existed in pre-Columbian 
America.

<p><img src="../../images/sci1.gif" > (21) <i>"The people of Nephi did till the land, and 
raise all manner of grain, and of fruit, and flocks of herds, and flocks of all manner of cattle of every kind, and 
goats, and wild goats, and also many horses."</i><br>
The Nephites planted "all manner of grain" and all manner of cattle, goats, and horses. (Cattle, horses, 
and European grains were absent in pre-Columbian North America.)

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>13</b>   And now behold, this was the desire which I desired of him -- that if it should so be, that my people, 
the Nephites, should fall into transgression, and by any means be destroyed, and the Lamanites should not be destroyed, 
that the Lord God would preserve a record of my people, the Nephites; even if it so be by the power of his holy arm, that 
it might be brought forth at some future day unto the Lamanites, that, perhaps, they might be brought unto 
salvation --  

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>14</b>   For at the present our strugglings were vain in restoring them to the true faith.  And they swore in 
their wrath that, if it were possible, they would destroy our records and us, and also all the traditions of our 
fathers. 

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>15</b>   Wherefore, I knowing that <span class="a">the Lord God
	</span>was able to preserve our records, I cried unto him continually, 
for he had <span class="a">said unto me:</span> <span class="plag">Whatsoever thing ye shall ask in faith, believing that ye shall receive in the name of Christ, 
ye shall receive it.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>16</b>   And I had faith, and <span class="a">I did cry unto God that he would preserve the records; and he covenanted with me 
that he would bring them forth unto the Lamanites in his own due time. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>17</b>   And I, Enos, knew it would be according to the covenant which he had made; wherefore my soul did 
rest. 

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>18</b> <span class="a">And the Lord said unto me: Thy fathers have also required of me this thing; and it shall be done unto 
them according to their faith; for their faith was like unto thine. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>19</b>   And now <span class="a">it came to pass</span> that I, Enos, went about among the people of Nephi, prophesying of things to 
come, and testifying of the things which I had heard and seen. 

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>20</b>   And I bear record that the people of Nephi did seek diligently to restore 
	<b> 
<span class="i">the Lamanites</span></b> unto the true faith in God.   But our labors were vain; their hatred was fixed, and 
<span class="i">they <b>were led by their evil nature that they became wild, and ferocious, and a bloodthirsty people, full 
of idolatry and filthiness</b>;</span> feeding upon beasts of prey; dwelling in tents, and wandering about in the wilderness with a 
short skin girdle about their loins and their heads shaven;</span> and their skill was in the bow, and in
<span class="sci"> the cimeter</span>, and the ax.  And <span class="i">many of them did eat nothing save it was raw 
meat; and they were continually seeking to destroy us.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>21</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that <span class="sci">the people of Nephi did till the land, and 
raise all manner of grain, and of fruit, and flocks of herds, and flocks of all manner of cattle of every kind, and 
goats, and wild goats, and also many horses.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>22</b>   <span class="a">And there were exceedingly many prophets among us.</span>  And the people were a stiffnecked people, hard to 
understand. 

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>23</b>   And there was nothing save it was <span class="a">exceeding</span> harshness, preaching and prophesying of wars, and 
contentions, and destructions, and continually reminding them of death, and the duration of eternity, and the 
judgments and the power of God, and all these things -- stirring them up continually to keep them in the fear of the 
Lord.  I say <span class="a">there was nothing short of these things, and exceedingly great plainness of speech, would keep them from 
going down speedily to destruction.  And after this manner do I write concerning them. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>24</b>   And I saw wars between the Nephites and Lamanites in the course of my days. <td bgcolor="eeeeee" rowspan="4">
