<p><li>Women are to dress modestly, "with shamefacedness" -- "not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly
array." <a href="2.html#9">2:9</a>

<p><li>"Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a
    woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence." <a href="2.html#11">2:11-12</a>

<p><li> Men are superior to women since Adam was made before, and sinned after, Eve. But even though women are
inferior to men, they shouldn't be discouraged because they shall "be saved in childbearing." <a href="2.html#14">2:14-15</a>

<p><li>"A bishop must be ... the husband of one wife." Apparently, it's OK for laymen to have 
several. <a href="3.html#2">3:2</a>

<p><li>Honoring widows indeed <a href="5.html#3">5:3-10</a>

<p><li>You should help a widow only if she: has no children or nephews; 
is desolate, trusts in God, and prays all the time; is not living in pleasure (a widow living in pleasure is the living dead); 
is over 60 years old; had only one husband; has raised children; has lodged strangers; has washed the saints' feet; has relieved 
the afflicted; and has diligently followed every good work. <a href="5.html#3">5:3-10</a>

<p><li>Never help a young widow (one under 60 years old). When they wax wanton against Christ, they'll get 
married, and be damned to hell for rejecting their faith. Besides, young widows are idle busybodies, wandering around from house to house saying 
things they shouldn't say. They should get married and have children (though 
they'll be damned to hell for it). Heck, some of them have already turned aside after Satan. <a href="5.html#11">5:11-15</a>
