<p><li>If you accuse an honorable women of adultery, be sure to bring four witness. 
Otherwise you will receive 80 lashes. <a href="index.htm#4">24:4</a> 

<p><li>A husband can accuse his wife of adultery with only one witness (himself). But he has to swear five times (so he can count as 
four or more separate witnesses in accordance with <a href="#4">24.4</a>). <a href="index.htm#6">24:6</a> 
 
<p><li>Believing women must lower their gaze and be modest, cover themselves with veils, 
and  not reveal themselves except to their husbands, relatives, children, and slaves.
 <a href="index.htm#31">24:31</a> 
 
<p><li>"And such of your slaves as seek a writing (of  emancipation), write it for them if ye are aware of aught of good in them, and bestow  
	upon them of the wealth of Allah which He hath bestowed upon you. Force not your  slave-girls to whoredom."<br>
	Well, I guess this is about as good as it gets in the Quran. Allah encourages you to set your slaves free if they are good enough. 
	And don't pimp out your slave-girls (concubines). <a href="index.htm#33">24:33</a>
