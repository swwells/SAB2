<td bgcolor="eeeeee" rowspan="28">

<font size="-1">
 <img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> 
 <img src="../../images/cr1.gif"> (26:1-6) Nephi tells us, once again, all about Jesus, 600 or so years before Jesus existed. After Jesus 
 dies he will rise from the dead and come visit the Nephites in North America. The Nephites will learn about Jesus' birth, death, and 
 resurrection and then all hell will break loose. Proud and wicked Nephites will stone to death the Nephite saints and prophets, 
 then God will cause the proud and the wicked to be swallowed by the earth, covered with mountains, carried away by whirlwinds, crushed by falling buildings, 
 destroyed by thunder, lightening, earthquakes, and fire. 
 
 <p>(26:1) <i>"After Christ shall have risen from the dead he shall show himself unto you, my children."</i>
 
 <p>(26:2) <i>"Many generations shall pass away, and there shall be great wars and contentions among my people."</i>
 
 <p>(26:3) <i>"After the Messiah shall come there shall be signs given unto my people of his birth, and also of his 
death and resurrection; and great and terrible shall that day be unto the wicked, for they shall perish; and they perish 
because they cast out the prophets, and the saints, and stone them, and slay them.&quot;</i>
 
 <p>(26:4) <i>"All those who are proud, and that do wickedly, the day that cometh shall 
burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts."</i>

<p>(26:5) <i>"They that kill the prophets, and the saints, the depths of the earth shall swallow them up, saith 
the Lord of Hosts; and mountains shall cover them, and whirlwinds shall carry them away, and buildings shall fall upon 
them and crush them to pieces and grind them to powder.</i>

<p>(26:6) <i>"And they shall be visited with thunderings, and lightnings, and 
earthquakes, and all manner of destructions, for the fire of the anger of the 
Lord shall be kindled against them."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif" > (26:9) the Sun of righteousness -- <a href="../../mal/4.html#2">Malachi 4:2</a>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (26: 10, 19) 
<a href="aictp_list.html">It shall came to pass</a> 

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> 
 <img src="../../images/cr1.gif"> (26:9-10) After the wicked kill the righteous and God kills the wicked, Jesus will heal 
 whatever survivors there may be and there will be peace for 
three or four generations. Then the Nephites will "yield to the devil," be destroyed again, and "go down to hell." 

<p>(26:9) <i>"The Son of righteousness shall appear unto them; and he shall heal them, and they shall have peace with him, 
until three generations shall have passed away, 
and many of the fourth generation shall have passed away in righteousness."</i>

<p>(26:10) <i>"And when these things have passed away a speedy destruction cometh unto my people ... 
they shall reap destruction; for because they yield unto the devil ... therefore they 
must go down to hell."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif" > (26:11) The Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive   with man -- <a href="../../gen/6.html#3">Genesis 6:3</a>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (26:12) Sometime after the Nephites are destroyed, the Gentiles (Non-Mormon Protestants) will start 
believing that Jesus is the Christ. 

<p>(26:12) <i>"It must needs be that the Gentiles be convinced also that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif" >
(26:12) This is the very Christ -- <a href="../../jn/7.html#26">John 7:26</a>

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif" > (26:13) every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people. -- <a href="../../rev/14.html#6">Revelation 14:6</a>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (26:14-15) In the last days after the Gentiles are converted, Nephi's seed will dwindle in unbelief and be smitten by the Gentiles. 
God will camp out against the dwindlers and "all those that dwindle in unbelief shall not be forgotten."

<p>(26:14) <i>"I prophesy unto you concerning the last days."</i>

<p>(26:15) <i>"After my seed ... shall have dwindled in unbelief, and shall have been smitten by the Gentiles; 
yea, after the Lord God shall have camped against them round about ... all those who have dwindled in unbelief shall not be forgotten."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif" > (26:16) And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out
        of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the

<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>26:1</b>   And <span class="a">after Christ shall have risen from the dead he shall show himself unto you, my children,</span> and my 
beloved brethren; and the words which he shall speak unto you shall be the law which ye shall do. 

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>26:2</b>   For behold, I say unto you that I have beheld that 
	<span class="a">many generations shall pass away, and there shall be 
great wars and contentions among my people. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>26:3</b>   And <span class="a">after the Messiah shall come there shall be signs given unto my people of his birth, and also of his 
death and resurrection; and great and terrible shall that day be unto the wicked, for they shall perish; and they perish 
because they cast out the prophets, and the saints, and stone them, and slay them</span>; wherefore the cry of the blood of the 
saints shall ascend up to God from the ground against them. 

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>26:4</b>   Wherefore, <span class="v">all those who are proud, and that do wickedly, the day that cometh shall 
burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts</span>, for they shall be as stubble. 

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>26:5</b>   And <span class="v">they that kill the prophets, and the saints, the depths of the earth shall swallow them up, saith 
the Lord of Hosts; and mountains shall cover them, and whirlwinds shall carry them away, and buildings shall fall upon 
them and crush them to pieces and grind them to powder.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>26:6</b>   <span class="v">And they shall be visited with thunderings, and lightnings, and earthquakes, and all 
manner of destructions, for the fire of the anger of the Lord shall be kindled against them</span>, and they shall be as stubble, and 
the day that cometh shall consume them, saith the Lord of Hosts. 

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>26:7</b>   O the pain, and the anguish of my soul for the loss of the slain of my people!  For I, Nephi, have seen 
it, and it well nigh consumeth me before the presence of the Lord; but I must cry unto my God: Thy ways are just. 

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>26:8</b>   But behold, the righteous that hearken unto the words of the prophets, and destroy them not, but look 
forward unto Christ with steadfastness for the signs which are given, notwithstanding all persecution -- behold, they 
are they which shall not perish. 

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>26:9</b>   But <span class="plag">the Son of righteousness shall appear unto them; and he shall heal them, and they shall have peace 
with him, until three generations shall have passed away, and many of the fourth generation shall have passed away in 
righteousness. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>26:10</b>   And <span class="a">when these things have passed away a speedy destruction cometh unto my people</span>; for, 
notwithstanding the pains of my soul, I have seen it; wherefore, I know that <span class="a">it shall come to pass</span>; and they sell 
themselves for naught; for, for the reward of their pride and their foolishness 
	<span class="a">they shall reap destruction; for 
because they yield unto the devil</span> and choose works of darkness rather than light, 
	<span class="a">therefore they must go down to 
hell. </span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>26:11</b>   For <span class="plag">the Spirit of the Lord will not always strive with man.</span>   And when the Spirit ceaseth to strive 
with man then cometh speedy destruction, and this grieveth my soul. 

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>26:12</b>   And as I spake concerning the convincing of the Jews, that 
<span class="plag">Jesus is the very Christ</span>, <span class="a">it must needs be 
that the Gentiles be convinced also that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God;
	</span>

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>26:15</b> <span class="a">After my seed </span>and the seed of my brethren 
	<span class="a">shall have dwindled in 
unbelief, and shall have been smitten

	<span class="a">round about</span>, and shall have laid siege against 
them with a mount, and raised forts against them; and after they shall have been brought down low in the dust, even 
that they are not, yet the words of the righteous shall be written, and the prayers of the faithful shall be heard, 
and <span class="i">all those who have </span><span class="a">dwindled in

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>26:16</b>   For those who shall be destroyed <span class="plag">shall speak unto them out of the ground, and their speech shall be

power,<span class="plag"> that he may whisper concerning them, even as it were out of the ground; and their speech shall whisper out of 
the dust. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>26:17</b>   <span class="a">For thus saith the Lord God:</span>
	<span class="a">They shall write the things which shall be done
 among them, and they shall be written and sealed up in a book, and </span> <span class="i">
  those who have </span><span class="a">dwindled in unbelief</span> 
 <span class="a">shall not have them, for they seek to destroy the things of God. 
</span> 
 
 
<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>26:18</b>   Wherefore, as those who have been destroyed have been destroyed speedily; and the multitude of their 
terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away -- yea, thus saith the Lord God: It shall be at an instant, 
suddenly --  

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>26:19</b>   <span class="a">And it shall come to pass, that those who 
have dwindled in unbelief shall be smitten by the hand of the Gentiles.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>26:20</b>   And <span class="a">the Gentiles</span> are lifted up in the pride of their eyes, and have 
	<span class="a">stumbled, 
because of the greatness of their stumbling block, that they have built up many churches</span>; nevertheless, they put down 
the power and miracles of God, and preach up unto themselves their own wisdom and their own learning, that they may 
get gain and grind upon the face of the poor. 

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>26:21</b>   And there are many churches built up <span class="i">which cause envyings, and 
strifes, and malice.</span> 

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>26:22</b>   <span class="a">And there are also secret combinations</span>, even as in times of 
old, <span class="a">according to the combinations of the devil, for he is the founder of all these things;</span> yea, the
 founder of murder, and works of darkness; yea, and he 
leadeth them by the neck with a flaxen cord, until he bindeth them with his strong cords forever. 

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>26:23</b>   For behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you that the Lord God worketh not in darkness. 

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>26:24</b>   He doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world; for he loveth the world, even that he 
layeth down his own life that he may draw all men unto him.  Wherefore, he commandeth none that they shall not partake 
of his salvation. 

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>26:25</b>   Behold, doth he cry unto any, saying: Depart from me?   Behold, I say unto you, Nay; but he saith: 
Come unto me all ye ends of the earth, <span class="plag">buy milk and honey, without money and without price. </span>

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>26:26</b>   Behold, hath he commanded any that they should depart out of the synagogues, or out of the houses of 
worship?  Behold, I say unto you, Nay. 

<tr><td><b><a name="27"></a>26:27</b>   Hath he commanded any that they should not partake of his salvation?  Behold I say unto you, Nay; but 
he hath given it free for all men; and he hath commanded his people that they should persuade all men to repentance. 

<tr><td><b><a name="28"></a>26:28</b>   Behold, hath the Lord commanded any that they should not partake of his goodness?  Behold I say unto 
you, Nay; but all men are privileged the one like unto the other, and none are forbidden. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="29"></a>26:29</b>   He commandeth that there shall be no priestcrafts; for, behold priestcrafts are that men preach and 
set themselves up for a light unto the world, that they may get gain and praise of the world; but they seek not the 
welfare of Zion. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="30"></a>26:30</b>   Behold, the Lord hath forbidden this thing; wherefore, 
	<span class="a">the Lord God hath given a

they should have charity they were nothing.</span>  Wherefore, if
