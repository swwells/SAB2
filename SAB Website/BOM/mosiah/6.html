<font size="-1">
<img src="../../images/abs1.gif"> (6:1-2) After King Benjamin finally finished speaking (God, I hope he's really done this time), he decided to make 
a list of all the born-again Christians. It turned out that everyone had been saved, except for maybe the little children -- 
120 years before Jesus was born!<br>

<p>(6:1) <i>"King Benjamin thought it was expedient, after having finished speaking to the people, that he should take the names of all 
those who had entered into a covenant with God."</i>

<p>(6:2) <i>"And it came to pass that there was not one soul, except it were little children, but who had entered into the covenant 
and had taken upon them the name of Christ."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" >
<a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a> (6:2, 3, 6)

<p><img src="../../images/abs1.gif" > (6:3-7) Benjamin made his son Mosiah king and appointed priests to instruct the people. Mosiah 
walked in the ways of the Lord and everything was peachy in Zarahemla, just like it was when his dad was king.

<p>(6:3) <i>"King Benjamin ... consecrated his son Mosiah to be a ruler and a king ... and also had appointed priests to teach the people."</i>

<p><img src="../../images/plag.gif" > (6:3) to stir you up by putting you in remembrance. -- <a href="../../2pet/1.html#13">2 Peter 1:13</a>

<p>(6:6) <i>"And it came to pass that king Mosiah did walk in the ways of the Lord, and did observe his judgments and his statutes, and did keep his
 commandments in all things whatsoever he commanded him."</i>
 
 <p>(6:7) <i>"And there was no contention among all his people for the space of three years."</i>
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>6:1</b>   And now, <span class="a">king Benjamin thought it was expedient, after having finished speaking to the people, that he 
should take the names of all those who had entered into a covenant with God</span> to keep his commandments. 

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>6:2</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that there was not one soul, except it were little children, 
but who had entered into the covenant and had taken upon them the name of Christ. 

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>6:3</b>   And again, <span class="a">it came to pass</span> that when king Benjamin had made an end of all these things, and had 
consecrated his son Mosiah to be a ruler and a king over his people, and had given him all the charges concerning the 
kingdom, and also had appointed priests to teach the people, that thereby they might hear and know the commandments of 
God, and <span class="plag">to stir them up in remembrance</span> of the oath which they had made, he dismissed the multitude, and they returned, 
every one, according to their families, to their own houses. 

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>6:4</b>   And Mosiah began to reign in his father's stead.  And he began to reign in the thirtieth year of his age, 
making in the whole, about four hundred and seventy-six years from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem. 

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>6:5</b>   And king Benjamin lived three years and he died. 

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>6:6</b>   <span class="a">And it came to 
pass</span> that king Mosiah did walk in the ways of the Lord, and did observe his judgments and his statutes, and did 
keep his commandments in all things whatsoever he commanded him. 

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>6:7</b>   And king Mosiah did cause his people that they should till the earth.  And he also, himself, did till the 
earth, that thereby he might not become burdensome to his people, that he might do according to that which his father had 
done in all things.  And there was no contention among all his people for the space of three years.
