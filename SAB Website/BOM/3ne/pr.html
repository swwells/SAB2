<p><li>God makes a repetitive and rambling speech announcing his own birth. He says that he'll be born tommorow. 
And that later that evening "a sign would be given." <a href="1.html#12">1:12-13</a>
<p><li>And God's prophecy came true! That night "there was no darkness when night came ... but it was as light as thought it 
was mid-day." <a href="1.html#15">1:15, 19</a>
<p><li>Jesus says there are other scriptures that "ye should write". Could this be a prophecy of the 
Book of Mormon?  <a href="23.html#6">23:6</a>
<p><li>The elements will melt, the earth will be rolled up like a scroll, and heaven and earth will 
pass away. <a href="26.html#3">26:3</a>
