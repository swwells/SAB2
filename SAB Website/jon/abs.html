<p><li>Jonah fled "from the presence of the Lord." (There are some places where God can't find you.) 
<a href="1.html#3">1:3, 10</a>

<p><li> The sailors cast lots to see who was causing the storm. And it worked, too (casting lots always does), 
since the lot fell on Jonah. <a href="1.html#7">1:7</a>

<p><li>Jonah believes that by throwing himself into the sea, the storm will die down.  
And it worked! <a href="1.html#12">1:12-15</a>

<p><li>God makes &quot;a great fish&quot; to swallow Jonah. And Jonah stayed in the
fish's belly for three days and three nights. <a href="1.html#17">1:17</a>

<p><li> Jonah says a little prayer from the fish's belly. <a href="2.html#1">2:1</a>

<p><li>God talks to the fish, and it vomits out Jonah upon dry land. <a href="2.html#10">2:10</a>

<p><li>"Now Nineveh was 
<a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/magazines/tsr/1992/2/2city92.html">an exceeding great city</a> of three days' 
journey." That would make it about 60 miles in diameter -- larger than Los Angeles!
<a href="3.html#3">3:3</a>

<p><li><I>Everyone</I> in Nineveh (pop. 120,000) turned to God?  Jonah must be one hell of a preacher!
  <a href="3.html#5">3:5</a>
  
<p><li>Even the animals converted when they heard Jonah preach!  <a href="3.html#8">3:8</a>
 
 <p><li>Jonah was angry when his preaching converted a city. <a href="4.html#1">4:1</a>
 
<p><li> God prepared a gourd to shade Jonah's head, a worm to destroy the gourd, 
and then a drying wind and baking sun that made Jonah wish he was dead. <a href="4.html#6">4:6-8</a>

<p><li>God asks Jonah why he is angry about the gourd. What about the 120,000 people that God planned to kill 
(along with their animals)? Shouldn't he be angry about that, too? <a href="4.html#9">4:9-11</a>
