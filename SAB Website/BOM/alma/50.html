"<span class='v'>The Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, ... and did slay them with much slaughter ... twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls.--<a href='2.html#18'>Alma 2:18-19</a>",
"<span class='i'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them.--<a href='3.html#6'>Alma 3:6</a>",
"<span class='i'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</span>--<a href='3.html#8'>Alma 3:8</a>",
"<span class='i'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</span>--<a href='3.html#9'>Alma 3:9</a>",
"<span class='i'>Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever.</span>--<a href='3.html#14'>Alma 3:14</a>",
"<span class='i'>I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</span>--<a href='3.html#15'>Alma 3:15</a>",

"<span class='a'>Now the reckoning is thus -- a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. </span>--<a href='11.html#5'>Alma 11:5-6</a>",
"<span class='a'>Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?   And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father.</span>--<a href='11.html#38'>Alma 11:38</a>",
"<span class='v'>Their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</span>--<a href='12.html#17'>Alma 12:17</a>",
"<span class='a'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges ... even until the fifth day of the second month in the eleventh year....</span>--<a href='16.html#1'>Alma 16:1</a>",
"<span class='a'>Their dead bodies were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years.</span>--<a href='16.html#11'>Alma 16:11</a>",
"<span class='i'>The Lamanites [were] a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them ... that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</span>--<a href='17.html#13'>Alma 17:13-14</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers.</span>--<a href='17.html#15'>Alma 17:15</a>",

"<span class='g'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#7'>Alma 30:7</a>",
"<span class='g'>If a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.</span>--<a href='30.html#9'>Alma 30:9</a>",
"<span class='g'>There was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.</span>--<a href='30.html#11'>Alma 30:11</a>",
"<span class='g'>It is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.</span>--<a href='30.html#16'>Alma 30:16</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.   Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.</span>--<a href='30.html#22'>Alma 30:22</a>",
"<span class='g'>Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a  parent.  Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents.</span>--<a href='30.html#25'>Alma 30:25</a>",
"<span class='g'>And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a  Christ.</span>--<a href='30.html#26'>Alma 30:26</a>",
"<span class='i'>God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.</span>--<a href='30.html#47'>Alma 30:47</a>",
"<span class='g'>We do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers.</span>--<a href='31.html#16'>Alma 31:16</a>",
"<span class='a'>If a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</span>--<a href='32.html#18'>Alma 32:18</a>",
"<span class='a'>The thing which our fathers call a ball, or director -- or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</span>--<a href='37.html#38'>Alma 37:38</a>",
"<span class='g'>Be filled with love.</span>--<a href='38.html#12'>Alma 38:12</a>",

"<span class='i'>Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded  his people that they should fall upon them and slay them.</span>--<a href='44.html#17'>Alma 44:17</a>",
"<span class='i'>Whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death.</span>--<a href='46.html#35'>Alma 46:35</a>",
"<span class='i'>These dissenters ... became ... more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='47.html#36'>Alma 47:36</a>",
"<span class='a'>God would prosper them in the land, or in other words ... God ... would prosper them in the land.</span>--<a href='48.html#15'>Alma 48:15</a>",
"<span class='i'>Thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</span>--<a href='50.html#22'>Alma 50:22</a>",
"<span class='v'>There were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword.</span>--<a href='51.html#19'>Alma 51:19</a>",
"<span class='i'>The remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty.</span>--<a href='51.html#20'>Alma 51:20</a>",
"<span class='g'>And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye.</span>--<a href='54.html#21'>Alma 54:21</a>",

<tr><td><b><a name="1"></a>50:1</b>   <span class="a">And now it came to pass</span> that Moroni did not stop making preparations for war, or to defend his 
people against the Lamanites; for he caused that his armies should commence in the commencement of the twentieth 
year of the reign of the judges, that they should commence in digging up heaps of earth round about all the 
cities, throughout all the land which was possessed by the Nephites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<font size="-1"><a href="aictp_list.html">And it came to pass</a><br>
(50:1, 7, 9, 13, 24, 25, 28, 31, 34, 35, 37, 39)
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="2"></a>50:2</b>   And upon the top of these ridges of earth he caused that there should be timbers, yea, works 
of timbers built up to the height of a man, round about the cities. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="3"></a>50:3</b>   And he caused that upon those works of timbers there should be a frame of pickets built upon the 
timbers round about; and they were strong and high. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="4"></a>50:4</b>   And he caused towers to be erected that overlooked those works of pickets, and he caused places of 
security to be built upon those towers, that the stones and the arrows of the Lamanites could not hurt them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="5"></a>50:5</b>   And they were prepared that they could cast stones from the top thereof, according to their 
pleasure and their strength, and slay him who should attempt to approach near the walls of the city. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="6"></a>50:6</b>   Thus Moroni did prepare strongholds against the coming of their enemies, round about every 
city in all the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="7"></a>50:7</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that Moroni caused that his armies should go 
forth into the east wilderness; yea, and they went forth and drove all the Lamanites who were in the east 
wilderness into their own lands, which were south of the land of Zarahemla. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="8"></a>50:8</b>   And the land of Nephi did run in a straight course from the east sea to the west. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="9"></a>50:9</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when Moroni had driven all the Lamanites out 
of the east wilderness, which was north of the lands of their own possessions, he caused that the inhabitants 
who were in the land of Zarahemla and in the land round about should go forth into the east wilderness, even to 
the borders by the seashore, and possess the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="10"></a>50:10</b>   And he also placed armies on the south, in the borders of their possessions, and caused 
them to erect fortifications that they might secure their armies and their people from the hands of their 
enemies. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="11"></a>50:11</b>   And thus he cut off all the strongholds of the Lamanites in the east wilderness, yea, and also 
on the west, fortifying the line between the Nephites and the Lamanites, between the land of Zarahemla and the 
land of Nephi, from the west sea, running by the head of the river Sidon -- the Nephites possessing all 
the land northward, yea, even all the land which was northward of the land Bountiful, according to their 
pleasure. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="12"></a>50:12</b>   Thus Moroni, with his armies, which did increase daily because of the assurance of protection 
which his works did bring forth unto them, did seek to cut off the strength and the power of the Lamanites from 
off the lands of their possessions, that they should have no power upon the lands of their possession. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="13"></a>50:13</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the Nephites began the foundation of a city, 
and they called the name of the city Moroni; and it was by the east sea; and it was on the south by the line of 
the possessions of the Lamanites. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="14"></a>50:14</b>   And they also began a foundation for a city between the city of Moroni and the city of Aaron, 
joining the borders of Aaron and Moroni; and they called the name of the city, or the land, Nephihah. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="15"></a>50:15</b>   And they also began in that same year to build many cities on the north, one in a particular 
manner which they called Lehi, which was in the north by the borders of the 
seashore. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="16"></a>50:16</b>   And thus ended the twentieth year. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="17"></a>50:17</b>   And in these prosperous circumstances 
were the people of Nephi in the commencement of the twenty and first year of the reign of the judges over the 
people of Nephi. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="18"></a>50:18</b>   And they did prosper <span class="a">exceedingly</span>, and they 
became <span class="a">exceedingly</span> rich; yea, and they did multiply and wax strong in the land. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/abs1.gif" width="32" height="32">
<font size="-1"><a href="exceed_list.html">Exceedingly</a> (50:18, 28)
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="19"></a>50:19</b>   And thus we see how merciful and just are all the dealings of the Lord, to the fulfilling of 
all his words unto the children of men; yea, we can behold that his words are verified, even at this time, 
which he spake unto Lehi, saying: <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="20"></a>50:20</b>   Blessed art thou and thy children; and they shall be blessed, inasmuch as they shall keep my 
commandments they shall prosper in the land.   But remember, inasmuch as they will not keep my commandments 
they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="21"></a>50:21</b>   And we see that these promises have been verified to the people of Nephi; for it has been 
their quarrelings and their contentions, yea, their murderings, and their plunderings, their idolatry, their 
whoredoms, and their abominations, which were among themselves, which brought upon them their wars and their 
destructions. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="22"></a>50:22</b>   And <span class="i">those who were faithful</span> in keeping the commandments of 
the Lord <span class="i">were delivered at all 
times, whilst thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, 
or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</span> <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<img src="../../images/int.gif" width="32" height="32">
<img src="../../images/inj1.gif" width="32" height="32"><br>
<font size="-1">Those who were faithful "were delivered at all times," while "thousands of their wicked brethren" were 
enslaved, killed, forced to <a href="diu_list.html">dwindle in unbelief</a>, or to "mingle with the Lamanites [Native Americans."
</font>

<tr><td><b><a name="23"></a>50:23</b>   But behold there never was a happier time among the people of Nephi, since the days of Nephi, 
than in the days of Moroni, yea, even at this time, in the twenty and first year of the reign of the judges. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="24"></a>50:24</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the twenty and second year of the reign of the 
judges also ended in peace; yea, and also the twenty and third year. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="25"></a>50:25</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that in the commencement of the twenty and 
fourth year of the reign of the judges, there would also have been peace among the people of Nephi had it 
not been for a contention which took place among them concerning the land of Lehi, 
and the land of Morianton, which joined upon the borders of Lehi; both of which 
were on the borders by the seashore. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="26"></a>50:26</b>   For behold, the people who possessed the land of Morianton did claim a part of the land 
of Lehi; therefore there began to be a warm contention between them, 
insomuch that the people of Morianton took up arms against their brethren, and they were determined by the 
sword to slay them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="50:27"></a>50:27</b>   But behold, the people who possessed the land of Lehi fled to 
the camp of Moroni, and appealed unto him for assistance; for behold they were not in the wrong. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="50:28"></a>50:28</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that when the people of Morianton, who were led by a man 
whose name was Morianton, found that the people of Lehi had fled to the camp of 
Moroni, they were <span class="a">exceedingly</span> fearful lest the army of Moroni should come upon them and 
destroy them. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="50:29"></a>50:29</b>   Therefore, Morianton put it into their hearts that they should flee to the land which 
was northward, which was covered with large bodies of water, and take possession of the land which was 
northward. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="50:30"></a>50:30</b>   And behold, they would have carried this plan into effect, (which would have been a cause to 
have been lamented) but behold, Morianton being a man of much passion, therefore he was angry with one of his 
maid servants, and he fell upon her and beat her much. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="50:31"></a>50:31</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that she fled, and came over to the camp of Moroni, 
and told Moroni all things concerning the matter, and also concerning their intentions to flee into the land 
northward. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="50:32"></a>50:32</b>   Now behold, the people who were in the land Bountiful, or rather Moroni, feared that they 
would hearken to the words of Morianton and unite with his people, and thus he would obtain possession of 
those parts of the land, which would lay a foundation for serious consequences among the people of Nephi, 
yea, which consequences would lead to the overthrow of their liberty. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="50:33"></a>50:33</b>   Therefore Moroni sent an army, with their camp, to head the people of Morianton, to stop their 
flight into the land northward. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="50:34"></a>50:34</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that they did not head them until they had come to 
the borders of the land Desolation; and there they did head them, by the narrow pass which led by the sea into 
the land northward, yea, by the sea, on the west and on the east. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="50:35"></a>50:35</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that the army which was sent by Moroni, which was led 
by a man whose name was Teancum, did meet the people of Morianton; and so stubborn were the people of Morianton, 
(being inspired by his wickedness and his flattering words) that a battle commenced between them, in the which 
Teancum did slay Morianton and defeat his army, and took them prisoners, and returned to the camp of Moroni.  
And thus ended the twenty and fourth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="50:36"></a>50:36</b>   And thus were the people of Morianton brought back.  And upon their covenanting to keep the 
peace they were restored to the land of Morianton, and a union took place between them and the people 
of Lehi; and they were also restored to their lands. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="50:37"></a>50:37</b>   <span class="a">And it came to pass</span> that in the same year that the people of 
Nephi had peace restored unto them, that Nephihah, the second chief judge, died, having filled the 
judgment-seat with perfect uprightness before God. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="50:38"></a>50:38</b>   Nevertheless, he had refused Alma to take possession of those records and those things 
which were esteemed by Alma and his fathers to be most sacred; therefore Alma had conferred them upon his 
son, Helaman. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="50:39"></a>50:39</b>   <span class="a">Behold, it came to pass</span> that the son of Nephihah was appointed to fill the judgment-seat, 
in the stead of his father; yea, he was appointed chief judge and governor over the people, with an oath and 
sacred ordinance to judge righteously, and to keep the peace and the freedom of the people, and to grant unto 
them their sacred privileges to worship the Lord their God, yea, to support and maintain the cause of God all 
his days, and to bring the wicked to justice according to their crime. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">

<tr><td><b><a name="50:40"></a>50:40</b>   Now behold, his name was Pahoran.  And Pahoran did fill the seat of his father, and did commence 
his reign in the end of the twenty and fourth year, over the people of Nephi. <td bgcolor="eeeeee">
