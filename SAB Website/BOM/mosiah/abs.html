<p><li> King Benjamin taught his sons Reformed Egyptian so they could read the brass plates. Good thing, too -- 
otherwise they'd suffer ignorance and dwindle in unbelief. <a href="1.html#1">1:1-5</a>

<p><li>Lehi, a 7th century Israelite, was taught in the language of the Egyptians. <a href="1.html#4">1:4</a>

<p><li>"And many more things did king Benjamin teach his sons, which are not written in this book."<br>
Thanks goodness for that! <a href="1.html#8">1:8</a>

<p><li>Before he died, King Benjamin selected his son Mosiah to replace him as king and gave him all his special things: the plates of Nephi,
the sword of Laban (that <a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2010/06/1-neph-4-better-for-one-man-to-die-than.html">Nephi used 
to decapitate Laban</a>), and <a href="http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2010/10/1-nephi-16-group-marriage-magic-brass.html">the magic 
ball of curious workmanship</a> that was made by God himself. <a href="1.html#15">1:15-16</a>

<p><li>The Nephites multiplied exceedingly. There were so many, in fact, that they couldn't be 
numbered and a tower had to be erected so that everyone could hear King Benjamin's exceedingly boring speech. <a href="2.html#2">2:2</a>, 
<a href="2.html#7">7</a>

<p><li>"I say unto you that I have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together that I might rid my garments of your blood." King 
Benjamin assembled everyone in his kingdom to rid his garments of their blood. Good idea. <a href="2.html#28">2:28</a>

<p><li>Mosiah tells us one more time about Jesus, who will be born in another 120 years or so. This is the umpteenth time Jesus is 
prophesied in great detail in the Book of Mormon. It's almost as though the whole thing was written using language that mimicked the 
King James Version of the Bible by someone living in nineteenth century America. <a href="3.html#1">3:1-27</a>

<p><li> "The things which I shall tell you are made known unto me by an angel from God. And he said unto me: Awake; and I awoke, 
and behold he stood before me." <a href="3.html#2">3:2</a>

<p><li>Devils dwell in the hearts of the children of men. But Jesus will cast them out when he comes. <a href="3.html#6">3:6</a>

<p><li>When Jesus dies, 150 or so years later, blood will come from every pore. <a href="3.html#7">3:7</a>

<p><li>Jesus, who wouldn't be born for another 120 years or so, will be both the Son of God and the Father of heaven and earth. 
<a href="3.html#8">3:8</a>

<p><li> When King Benjamin quit speaking, everyone in Zarahemla fell on their faces and "they all cried aloud with one voice, saying: 
O have mercy, and apply the atoning blood of Christ that we may receive forgiveness of our sins, and our hearts may be purified; for we 
believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who created heaven and earth, and all things; who shall come down among the children of men." 
<a href="4.html#1">4:1-2</a>

<p><li>After King Benjamin's speech, he sent his officials out to ask the people if they believed the stuff he told them. He didn't 
need Nate Silver to do the analysis. Everyone believed everything he said and cried out together, "Yea, we believe all the words 
which thou hast spoken to us...." <a href="5.html#1">5:1-5</a>

<p><li>And, by golly, those were just the words King Benjamin hoped they'd say!
"These are the words which king Benjamin desired of them." <a href="5.html#6">5:6</a>

<p><li>After King Benjamin finally finished speaking (God, I hope he's really done this time), he decided to 
make a list of all the born-again Christians. It turned out that everyone had been saved, except for maybe the 
little children -- 120 years before Jesus was born! <a href="6.html#1">6:1-2</a>

<p><li>Benjamin made his son Mosiah king and appointed priests to instruct the people. Mosiah 
walked in the ways of the Lord and everything was peachy in Zarahemla, just like it was when his dad was king. <a href="6.html#3">6:3-7</a>

<p><li>The first three years of King Mosiah's reign were peaceful. But he was getting a little bored, and was wondering 
about his brethren who had left Zarahemla years ago. So he sent 16 of his finest men to the land of Lehi-Nephi to go 
looking for them. Ammon (a strong and mighty man) was their leader. <a href="7.html#1">7:1-3</a>

<p><li>After 40 days of wandering around, they set up camp on a hill north of Shilom, in the land of Nephi. <a href="7.html#4">7:4-5</a>

<p><li>The next morning, Ammon and three of his best men went down into the land of Nephi to explore. They 
promptly got thrown in jail by the king's guard. <a href="7.html#6">7:6-7</a>

<p><li> After two days in jail, the king brought them out for questioning. He told them that he was Limhi (the son of Noah, 
who was the son of Zeniff, who came up out of the land of Zarahemla) and then asked them to explain why they were there, or
 else be put to death. Seems fair. <a href="7.html#8">7:8-11</a>
 
 <p><li>Ammon bows and thanks King Limhi for not already killing him, and for letting him explain himself. There is so much to be thankful for! 
 <a href="7.html#12">7:12</a>
 
 <p><li>After Ammon tells his story, Lemhi is pleased. His people are being forced to pay a high tribute to the Lamenites, 
 and he figures that his long-lost brethren in Zarahemla will help him out of the mess. <a href="7.html#13">7:13-15</a>
 
 <p><li>So King Lemhi set Ammon and his men free, and allowed them to eat, drink and rest in the city. He even 
 sent a few guards to collect the rest of the men who were still camping on the hill. <a href="7.html#16">7:16</a>
 
 <p><li>Then King Lemhi sent a proclamation to all his people, telling them to gather together for a speech (oh boy!).
  Once everyone gathers around, he gives them the good news: "The time is at hand, or is not far distant, when we shall
   no longer be in subjection to our enemies." <a href="7.html#17">7:17-18</a>
   
   <p><li>Lehi then preaches for a little while about how the tribute was their fault in the first place; that it was a punishment 
   sent from the Lord because of their iniquity. Luckily, God is now giving them a second chance. <a href="7.html#19">7:19-33</a>

<p><li>A seer is greater than a prophet. He is a revelator with a Divine gift that is greater than all others.
 <a href="8.html#15">8:15</a>
 
 <p><li>"And a fifth part of their ziff"<br>
Oh no! Zeniff made the people give up a fifth of the ziff! Now <i>that</i> would be hard to live with. <a href="11.html#3">11:3</a>

<p><li>"King Noah built many elegant and spacious buildings" ornamented with gold, silver, iron, brass, copper, and ziff.<br>
Why is there no evidence for these fancy buildings? There were many of them, decorated with gold and silver. Where are they now? And 
the metallurgy technology for iron and brass didn't exist prior to European contact. But there was plenty of ziff around at the time 
so that wouldn't have been a problem. <a href="11.html#8">11:8</a>
 
 <p><li>God will smite his people with sore afflictions, famine, pestilence, and will cause them to howl all 
the day long. <a href="12.html#4">12:4</a>

<p><li>"Yea, even doth not Isaiah say:"<br>
Joseph Smith adds another chapter from Isaiah (<a href="../../is/53.html">53</a>) as filler. <a href="14.html#1">14:1</a>

<p><li>Jesus is <i>both</i> the Father and the Son! <a href="15.html#2">15:2-3</a>

<p><li>All this was done in Mormon, yea, by the waters of Mormon, in the forest 
that was near the waters of Mormon; yea, the place of Mormon, the waters of Mormon, the forest of Mormon.
 <a href="18.html#30">18:30</a>
 
<p><li>The evil Amulon put guards on Alma and his people, ordering them to kill whoever prays outloud.
 <a href="24.html#11">24:11</a>
 
<p><li>Mosiah translated the Jaredite plates by looking at stones in the bottom of a hat -- just like Joseph 
Smith did with the Book of Mormon! <a href="28.html#13">28:13</a>

<p><li>A seer is someone who can translate things by looking at stones in the bottom of a hat.
 <a href="28.html#16">28:16</a>
 
<p><li>The Jaredite sailed to the New World after God confounded human language at the Tower of Babel.
 <a href="28.html#17">28:17</a>
