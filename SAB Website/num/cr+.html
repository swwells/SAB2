<p><li>God shows his hospitality with the admonition: "The stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death." 
 <a href="1.html#51">1:51</a>, <a href="3.html#10">3:10</a>, <a href="3.html#38">3:38</a>
 
<p><li>Two of Aaron's sons are killed by God for "offering strange fire before the Lord." <a href="3.html#4">3:4</a>

<p><li>Don't touch or "go in to see when the holy things are covered." God kills people who touch or look 
at covered holy things.  <a href="4.html#15">4:15</a>,  <a href="4.html#20">20</a>

<p><li>God tells the people to expel from camp "every leper, every one that hath an issue, and whoever is defiled by the dead."
So by God's instructions, the sick are abandoned and left to suffer and die alone.  <a href="5.html#1">5:1-4</a>

<p><li>"And when the people complained, it displeased the Lord: and the Lord heard it." (He had his hearing aid on.) He then
burned the complainers alive. That'll teach them.  <a href="11.html#1">11:1</a>

<p><li>"And wile the flesh [of the quails] was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the Lord was kindled
against the people, and the Lord smote the people with a very great plague. "The Bible isn't too clear about what these poor
folks did to upset God so much; all it says is that they had "lusted."  <a href="11.html#33">11:33</a>

<p><li>Miriam and Aaron (Moses' brother and sister) criticize Moses for marrying an Ethiopian woman and thus breaking
the law of God. But God makes it clear that his rules 
don't apply to his favorites, and he strikes Miriam with leprosy. Notice that 
only Miriam is punished, though both she and Aaron complained.  
<a href="12.html#1">12:1</a>, <a href="12.html#9">9-10</a>

<p><li>God punishes the children for the failings of their great-great grandfathers. 
<a href="14.html#18">14:18</a>

<p><li>God killed those that murmured against him with a plague. <a href="14.html#36">14:36-37</a> 

<p><li>The Israelites find a man picking up sticks on the sabbath. God commands them to kill him by throwing 
rocks at him.  <a href="15.html#32">15:32-36</a>

<p><li>Because of a dispute between Korah and
Moses, God has the ground open up and swallow Korah, Dathan, and Abiram "and their wives, and 
their sons, and their little children." Then, just for the hell of it, God has a fire burn to death 
250 "men that offered incense."  
<a href="16.html#20">16:20-35</a>

<p><li>After God killed Korah, his family, and 250 innocent bystanders, the people complained saying, "ye have killed the
people of the Lord." So God, who doesn't take kindly to criticism, sends a plague on the people. And "they that died in the
plague were 14,700."  <a href="16.html#41">16:41-50</a>

<p><li>Stay away from holy things and places -- like churches. God might have to kill you if you get
too close.<a href="18.html#3">18:3, 22, 32</a>

<p><li>God shows us how to make new friends by saying : "The stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death." 
 <a href="18.html#7">18:7</a>
 
<p><li>"And the Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and
their cities." This verse demonstrates the power of prayer: If you ask God, he will destroy entire cities for you. 
 <a href="21.html#3">21:3</a>
 
<p><li>God sends "fiery serpents" to bite his chosen people, and many of them die.  <a href="21.html#6">21:6</a>

<p><li>God delivers the Amorites into Moses' hands. (You're in God hands with Moses.) So Moses does the usual thing,
killing everyone "until their was none left alive."  <a href="21.html#34">21:34-35</a>

<p><li>God's people will kill like a lion and then "drink the blood of the slain."  <a href="23.html#24">23:24</a>

<p><li>God, who is as strong as a unicorn, will eat up the nations, break their bones, and then pierce them through with his
arrows. What a guy!  <a href="24.html#8">24:8</a>

<p><li>After the people "commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab," Moses has them all killed. Then God tells Moses to
hang their dead bodies up in front of him; God says that this will satisfy him.  <a href="25.html#1">25:1-5</a>

<p><li>When one of the Israelite men brings home a foreign woman, "Phinehas (Aaron's grandson) sees them and throws a spear "through the man .. and the woman through her belly."
This act pleases God so much that "the plague was stayed from the children of Israel." But not before 
24,000 had died.  <a href="25.html#6">25:6-9</a>

<p><li>For impaling the interracial couple, God rewards Phinehas and his sons with the everlasting 
priesthood. <a href="25.html#10">25:10-13</a>

<p><li>The ground swallow Korah and his companions and a fire consumes 250 men.  <a href="26.html#10">26:10</a>

<p><li>"And Nadab and Abihu died when they offered strange fire before the Lord." When you go camping avoid making any
unusual fires.  <a href="26.html#61">26:61</a>

<p><li>Under God's direction, Moses' army defeats the Midianites. They kill all the adult males, but take the women and
children captive. When Moses learns that they left some live, he angrily says: "Have you saved all the women alive? Kill
every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. But all the women children,
that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves." So they went back and did as Moses (and
presumably God) instructed, killing everyone except for the virgins. In this way they got 32,000 virgins -- Wow! 
(Even God
gets some of the booty -- including the virgins.) <a href="31.html#1">31:1-54</a>

<p><li>God tells Moses to exterminate the residents of Canaan and destroy all of their religious symbols and possessions.
 <a href="33.html#50">33:50-52</a>
 
 <p><li>But if the Israelites don't kill them all, then God will make them pricks in their eyes and 
thorns in their sides. And he will do unto the Israelites as he planned to do to the inhabitants of 
Canaan. <a href="33.html#55">33:55-56</a>

<p><li>"The revenger of blood" must murder the murderer just as soon as he sees him. <a href="35.html#19">35:19, 21</a>

<p><li>When a murder is committed the blood pollutes the land. The only way to cleanse it is to spill more blood by killing the
killer.  <a href="35.html#30">35:30, 33</a>
