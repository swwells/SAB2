 King Josiah is prophesied to sacrifice the

what was right in the eyes of the Lord." (<A href="../2kg/22.html#2">2

  <span class="a">And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and the

  And <span class="i">when the prophet</span> that brought him back from the way <span class="i">heard thereof, he
    said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the word of the LORD:
    therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him,
    and slain him, according to the word of the LORD</span>, which he spake unto him.

  And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid it upon
    the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn
    and to bury him.

  And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over him,
    saying, Alas, my brother!<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons,
    saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God
    is buried; lay my bones beside his bones:<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><b><A name="32">13:32</A></B>
  For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in
    Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the
    cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">
  <tr><td><b><A name="33">13:33</A></B>
  After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again
    of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he
    consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places.<td bgcolor="eeeeee">

  And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off,
    and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.
