<p><li>"If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and
    pray ... then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land."<br>
    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_zEq1L9FU">The Christian Right uses this verse</a> to argue for a Christian Nation. 
    But it can also be interpreted to mean that <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/unreasonablefaith/2012/03/christians-dont-vote-pray-instead/">Christians should pray, not vote.</a> 
 <a href="7.html#14">7:14</a>

<p><li>"Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the LORD."<br>
Hate the sinner <a href="http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/4907219327.html">and vote for Christians</a> 
-- or God will pour his wrath out on you. <a href="19.html#2">19:2</a>
